               FADE IN:

               CASTLE - NIGHT

               Now comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at 
               the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework 
               bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes 
               decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the 
               walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to 
               an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light 
               dances on a leaded windowpane.

               Inside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched 
               ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. 
               Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with 
               strange animal heads.

               HODGE

               A sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables 
               and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering 
               candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently.

               CONJURING ROOM

               This circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed 
               with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass 
               retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An 
               iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In 
               the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, 
               moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for 
               a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a 
               pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up 
               comes an arm and a voice blurts out:

                                     VOICE
                         Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in 
                         Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia 
                         nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt.

               Nothing happens.

                                     VOICE
                         Come on, candles, out!

               But the little flames stand at attention without so much as 
               a tremble.

                                     VOICE
                         In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi: 
                         Lux! Exstinguat!

               It's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward 
               into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face 
               of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.

               TOWER

               Carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular 
               staircase.

               TURRET

               The highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the 
               stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old 
               enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a 
               silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples 
               disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at 
               once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and 
               thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from 
               within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as 
               the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in 
               the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the 
               roar of flame and an ugly snarl.

               At that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds 
               up the candelabra.

                                     GALEN
                         Vide, Magister. There's something 
                         wrong.

               Ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the 
               basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback 
               by the old man's grim countenance.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter? What's happened?

                                     ULRICH
                         I've just seen something. Something 
                         of consequence to you.

                                     GALEN
                         To me?

                                     ULRICH
                              (calm)
                         Yes. My own death.

               With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish 
               themselves.

                                     ULRICH
                         Perhaps we had better hasten your 
                         training.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARNYARD - DAY

               Outside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and 
               ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning 
               mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward 
               the woods.

               ULRICH AND GALEN

               Hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides 
               his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the 
               forest.

                                     ULRICH
                              (stern and troubled)
                         This wood, these leaves, the birds, 
                         the very dome of heaven, once they 
                         all rang with one great chord: and 
                         philosophers like me kept it all in 
                         tune. Now, new voices are singing 
                         new songs.
                              (sharply)
                         Have you mastered the threefold 
                         transmutation?

                                     GALEN
                         Of course.

                                     ULRICH
                              (skeptical)
                         You have?

                                     GALEN
                         Well, almost.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's very difficult. Have you 
                         committed to memory undying the Codex 
                         de Profundis?

                                     GALEN
                              (a shrug)
                         The first two chapters.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's long. And what about the Ritual 
                         of Banishment as prescribed by my 
                         late master Balisarius?

                                     GALEN
                         To tell the truth, I haven't dared 
                         try it. What's the point, anyway?

                                     ULRICH
                         The point? The point is you don't 
                         know it, and you're no magician 
                         without it. It was my hope to school 
                         you, to mold your faculties and 
                         wits... I still believe you have 
                         some talent. Somewhere.

                                     GALEN
                         I hate books. I hate drill. I want a 
                         real task.

                                     ULRICH
                         There's no time now. When I'm gone, 
                         half the powers in the universe will 
                         vanish with me. And what's the use 
                         of a few lingering skills if they're 
                         left in the hands of a child?
                              (pause)
                         Listen!

                                     GALEN
                         I don't hear anything.

               Ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a 
               decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver 
               chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around 
               Galen's neck.

                                     ULRICH
                         Here, wear this.

               Galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks 
               an ear.

                                     GALEN
                         Voices, singing on the road.

               He hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. 
               Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls 
               it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the 
               ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard.

                                     GALEN
                         I don't see anything.

               He turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over 
               him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree 
               tops his master is soaring on the wind.

               AIRBORNE

               The old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and 
               far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins 
               of the forest. They are singing a mournful round.

               GALEN

               He gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and 
               addresses him.

                                     ULRICH
                              (a shout)
                         We have visitors!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROTUNDA - NIGHT

               Clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall 
               is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty 
               rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned 
               youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his 
               name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before 
               them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at 
               the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer 
               peers at himself in a full-length mirror, adjusting the hem 
               of a black robe.

                                     ULRICH
                         Looks forbidding enough, don't you 
                         think?

                                     GALEN
                         Here are your sticks.

                                     ULRICH
                         No -- they'll think me infirm. You 
                         know, Balisarius wore this whenever 
                         he changed lead into gold. He could 
                         really do that, you know. I never 
                         could. Too bad -- you'd stand to 
                         inherit some real wealth.

                                     GALEN
                         You're in a morbid frame of mind. 
                         What's all this about dying? You 
                         don't even look sick.

                                     ULRICH
                              (tying on a sash)
                         You still wearing that amulet?
                              (Galen nods)
                         Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs 
                         to me.

               He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto 
               his head.

                                     ULRICH
                         Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a 
                         handful of that sulphurous ash over 
                         there...

               The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase.

               THE ROTUNDA

               The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen 
               makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed 
               together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich.

               Galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide. 
               Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky 
               fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat.

                                     ULRICH
                         Nunc habeus lux!

               Pffst! around the room candles flare in their niches.

                                     ULRICH
                         Et calor!

               In the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich 
               totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward 
               the warmth.

                                     ULRICH
                         Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich. 
                         Which one of you calls himself 
                         Valerian?

               The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's 
               performance. The young leader of the party screws up his 
               courage and speaks.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That would be me. We are here on 
                         behalf...

                                     ULRICH
                         I know why you're here. You're a 
                         delegation from Urland, from beyond 
                         Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts.

               The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to 
               one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over 
               a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on 
               the table for Ulrich's inspection.

                                     VALERIAN
                         A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire-
                         blackened.
                              (pause)
                         Scales.

               At this, Ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering 
               irridescent disks as big as saucers.

                                     ULRICH
                         All right. How did you come by these?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (proudly)
                         I found them. At the mouth of the 
                         lair.

                                     ULRICH
                              (grim)
                         What else?

               Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears 
               to be a curved sword. He jabs it into the table.

                                     VALERIAN
                         A claw.

                                     ULRICH
                         That's no claw. It's a tooth. By the 
                         gods!

               He runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at 
               his visitors.

                                     ULRICH
                         And you want me to do battle with 
                         that?

               Valerian has lost all trace of timidity.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Who else can we turn to? We all know 
                         what we're dealing with here. This 
                         is a basilicok.
                              (he takes a step 
                              forward)
                         A cockatrice.
                              (another step, bolder)
                         A dragon.
                              (he leans close to 
                              Ulrich)
                         This is no stag, no bear, no natural 
                         creature. This is one of your kind. 
                         And only a necromancer such as 
                         yourself can rid us of it.

                                     ULRICH
                         Did you try the Meredydd sisters? 
                         What about Rinbod? I've heard it 
                         said he killed a dragon once.

                                     VALERIAN
                         They're all dead. You're the only 
                         one left.

               With a sigh, Ulrich lowers himself into a chair. He rubs his 
               withered legs and shakes his head.

                                     ULRICH
                         It's a long way to Urland.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Every quarter, upon the solstices 
                         and the equinoxes there's a new 
                         victim.

               Greil, a grizzled peasant, speaks up.

                                     GREIL
                         My daughter, for one.

                                     OTHER TRAVELERS
                         My sister... cousins...

                                     ULRICH
                         All women?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen 
                         by lot.

               Galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and 
               tooth.

                                     GALEN
                         Master, don't you think --

                                     ULRICH
                         Silence!

               He broods for a long time.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Are you afraid of dragons?

                                     ULRICH
                         No. Sorcerers and dragons go back a 
                         long long time together. If it weren't 
                         for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any 
                         dragons.
                              (pause)
                         All right. I'll go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               COURTYARD - DAY

               The travelers are making ready for departure in the grey 
               light of dawn. As Hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box, 
               Ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches.

                                     ULRICH
                         I know of this dragon. Vermithrax 
                         Pejorative: she's four hundred years 
                         old. As far as I can tell she's the 
                         last of her kind. Very appropriate 
                         that I'm the one to finish her off, 
                         don't you think?
                              (he tries out the 
                              crutches)
                         There. Flatten the highest mountain. 
                         What say you, Galen?
                              (no answer)
                         Speak up.
                              (still no answer)
                         You, Hodge.

               Hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing.

                                     ULRICH
                              (to Galen)
                         While I'm gone see you keep your 
                         nose in your books and your hands 
                         out of my reagents. Leave my 
                         instruments alone too.

               Galen crouches against the castle wall; he regards his master 
               sullenly.

                                     GALEN
                         Look at yourself. How far will you 
                         get like that? A league, two leagues?

                                     ULRICH
                         I'm not worried about the road.

                                     GALEN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Why don't you wave your hands around 
                         and summon up a coach-and-four?

                                     ULRICH
                         Don't mock me.

               Galen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders.

                                     GALEN
                         You pilgrims: You're used to 
                         lotteries. Why not draw straws to 
                         see who'll be first to carry 
                         ironshanks here.

               This is too much for Hodge.

                                     HODGE
                         Hold your tongue. If the master's 
                         got a mind to go, he'll go.

               Galen approaches the old sorcerer.

                                     GALEN
                         Send me. You're always saying I need 
                         seasoning. I need a test. Let me go.

                                     ULRICH
                         You're not ready.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm ready for anything.

                                     ULRICH
                              (wan smile)
                         Don't be so hasty. Your time will 
                         come.

               The walkers are ready to set forth. Hodge picks up his pack, 
               steps forward and pulls open the great gate.

               HORSEMEN

               Three mounted men are outside the gate, helmets on their 
               heads, swords on the belts and longbows across their 
               shoulders. They look formidable. The Urlanders take a step 
               backward.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Tyrian!?

               Tyrian is a lean, heavily bearded nobleman. There is a coat 
               of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (amiable)
                         Good morning, all.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We're not afraid of you. Give us the 
                         road.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Why, the road is yours. All the way 
                         to Urland. It's a long journey, isn't 
                         it? But when you're in search of a 
                         sorcerer, I suppose no distance is 
                         too great.

               Sensing trouble, Galen moves forward. Ulrich touches his 
               arm.

                                     ULRICH
                              (under his breath)
                         Say nothing.

               Galen hears the urgency in the old man's voice and obeys. 
               Hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers.

                                     HODGE
                         What do you want with us?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Well, like my good friends here, 
                         I've come for a bit of black magic. 
                         No doubt you've heard of our troubles 
                         at home. This is Cragganmore, is it 
                         not?

                                     HODGE
                         Aye, this be the place of Ulrich.

               Tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician.

                                     TYRIAN
                         And here we have the mystical presence 
                         himself, no?

                                     HODGE
                         You'd best keep your distance -- and 
                         your manners.

                                     TYRIAN
                         If he's ready to lay a dragon in its 
                         grave, he's got nothing to fear from 
                         me.
                              (turns to the Urlanders)
                         I've no more love for that creature 
                         than you lot. Nor has the King. But, 
                         before you stir things up, don't you 
                         think it a good idea to see you've 
                         got the right man for the job?

                                     HODGE
                         Aha -- it's a test you're looking 
                         for. We don't do tests.

                                     TYRIAN
                         I'm sure you don't. They never do 
                         tests -- and not many real deeds 
                         either. Oh, conversation with your 
                         grandmother's shade in a darkened 
                         room, the odd love potion or two... 
                         but comes a doubter, well then, it's 
                         the wrong day, the planets are not 
                         aligned, the entrails aren't 
                         favorable, we don't do tests.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We've got no doubts. We require no 
                         test.

                                     HODGE
                         And you're not going to get one.

               When Ulrich finally speaks, his voice is low and 
               authoritative.

                                     ULRICH
                              (to Galen)
                         Go to the conjuring room. The iron 
                         box. Fetch me the dagger within.

               Galen's eyes widen with alarm.

                                     ULRICH
                         The dagger. Be quick.

               Galen dashes into the castle. Ulrich gazes almost shyly at 
               Tyrian.

                                     ULRICH
                         You shall have your test.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen comes puffing up the steps, locates the iron box, and 
               flings it open. Amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a 
               professional magician is an ivory-handled dagger covered 
               with runic inscriptions. Galen eagerly examines it to see 
               how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle, 
               but it is all too genuine. A murder weapon.

                                     ULRICH'S VOICE
                              (impatient)
                         Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.

               Galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard. 
               He displays the dagger.

                                     GALEN
                         Not this one, was it?

                                     ULRICH
                         The very one. Let it fall.

               Galen hesitates, then tosses it. Tumbling end over end, it 
               arcs downward. The old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand 
               and plucks it neatly out of the air. Galen watches as Ulrich 
               passes the weapon to Tyrian and strips back his robe exposing 
               a bony chest. Galen knows what's coming. He rushes for the 
               door. He's only a step away when it bangs shut of its own 
               accord. He sprints for a second exit. Whack! This door slams 
               shut too. Locked in. Quick, back to the window and climb 
               down the vine... Smack! the heavy shutters seal him in.

               ULRICH AND TYRIAN

               Ulrich takes Tyrian's arm and guides the point of the dagger 
               to his breastbone.

                                     ULRICH
                         Vita regula, vita hieratica!

               Everyone is filled with dread. Hodge is shaking. From the 
               castle come the rattling of shutters and Galen's muffled 
               cries. A sick sarcastic smile has crept over Tyrian's lips. 
               He tenses himself to thrust.

                                     ULRICH
                         Go on. Don't worry, you can't hurt 
                         me.

               CONJURING ROOM

               Galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the 
               shutter. Below he can see the participants in this grisly 
               drama. He holds his breath. Tyrian makes a sudden movement 
               and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest. But the sorcerer 
               stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, after a long moment, 
               he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that 
               holds it. Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in 
               a heap. Very quickly he remounts. In another moment he and 
               his companions are gone. The others are riveted in horror. 
               Hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief.

               Galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the 
               gloomy conjuring room. Click! The doors unlatch themselves 
               and swing open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FUNERAL PYRE - DAY

               Ulrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world, 
               reposes on a hardwood pyre. His hands are folded on his chest. 
               His face is peaceful. While the visitors wordlessly look on, 
               Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. At first the 
               fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to 
               envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an 
               unearthly roar. The onlookers back away from the intense 
               heat.

               GALEN

               The erstwhile apprentice stands his ground, blinking back 
               tears, his face weirdly illuminated by the fire.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CONJURING ROOM - DAY

               Galen sits alone amidst the museum-like collection of magical 
               apparatus. He stares at the amulet, considering its 
               significance. His reverie is interrupted by the murmur of 
               voices below. At the window he looks down to see Hodge bidding 
               farewell to the delegation from Urland. Valerian is the last 
               to leave. He pauses at the gate and glances up at Galen. 
               Then he moves on. The young student of magic sets his jaw, 
               suddenly filled with resolve.

               Moving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's 
               effects. He scoops up the loose books and parchments and 
               locks them into trunks. He drapes muslin cloths over the 
               alchemical devices. He sows a handful of salt over the 
               pentagram inscribed in the floor. Finally, he opens the cages 
               and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl.

               COURTYARD

               Hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping 
               ashes and small bones into a leather pouch -- the remains of 
               Ulrich. Up behind him comes Galen, now clad in a traveler's 
               cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge -- what are you doing?

               Hodge quickly conceals the pouch.

                                     HODGE
                         Just making my farewell, thank you 
                         very much.

               He quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows Galen 
               out through the gate. As the door is pushed shut a huge oaken 
               timber falls into place, barring the castle against the 
               uninvited.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HILLTOP - DAY

               Galen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn 
               to look back across a wide valley. There on another hilltop 
               on the far side sits Cragganmore, lit by the red rays of the 
               setting sun. Galen removes the amulet from his neck and 
               clutches it in his fist. Hodge is bug-eyed to see it.

                                     HODGE
                         Be careful with that! You don't know 
                         what you're doing.

                                     GALEN
                         Stand back!

               He raises his hands toward the castle and calls out:

                                     GALEN
                         Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva 
                         celet!

               CRAGGANMORE

               The vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch, 
               magically brought to animate life. They flow upward over the 
               masonry, branching out and covering every surface, then up 
               onto the roof. Finally only the tops of the chimneys and the 
               highest turrets stand above the green carpet. A century's 
               growth in a matter of seconds.

               GALEN & HODGE

               On their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a fearful 
               look. Galen is too flushed with excitement over what he has 
               done to notice.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               FOREST PATH - DAY

               Galen and Hodge trudge along an overgrown cart-track under 
               an arch of trees.

                                     HODGE
                         Oh, it's a vale of tears in which we 
                         dwell. It doesn't matter who you 
                         are, a king in his robes, a peasant 
                         in his rags, when your time comes, 
                         no magic can save you...

                                     GALEN
                         I guess...

               The apprentice's mind is elsewhere: he's got a coin hovering 
               in mid-air above his palm, bobbing gently as he walks.

                                     HODGE
                         ...the kindest lord a man could ask 
                         for... now he's gone. Ye gods he was 
                         fussy about his bath. And you'd think 
                         he could boil his own eggs with the 
                         snap of a finger, but no, he had old 
                         Hodge do it, of course.
                              (snurfling)
                         Up before five I was, mucking out 
                         the cages, slopping the pigs, and 
                         never once got so much as a thankyou 
                         or a pat on the back...
                              (through tears)
                         I'm going to miss him.

                                     GALEN
                         Me too...

               He plucks a low-hanging leaf, waves a hand over it, and 
               watches it turn into a spray of daffodils.

                                     HODGE
                         No you don't. All you care about is 
                         the tricks and knavery. Well, you 
                         don't pull any wool over these old 
                         eyes. It'll be a mighty long walk 
                         before you fill his shoes, you mark 
                         my word.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter, Hodge, pack too 
                         heavy? Here.

               He gives the pack a slap. It flies out of its harness and 
               floats alongside them. Hodge snatches it back and clutches 
               it tightly.

                                     HODGE
                         Careful with that!

                                     GALEN
                         Too cold, is it?

               A great coat drapes itself over Hodge's shoulders.

                                     HODGE
                         Stop it!

                                     GALEN
                         Too warm?

               The greatcoat disappears, as do the rest of his garments, 
               leaving him in his smalls.

                                     HODGE
                              (spluttering)
                         Stop it, I say! Out of respect for 
                         the master!

               Suppressing a grin, Galen mercifully waves his hand and 
               restores Hodge to his usual costume.

                                     GALEN
                         I've got as much respect for the 
                         master as anyone, old man. But -- 
                         then again, I'm master now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TRAVELERS' CAMP - NIGHT

               The Urlanders are gathered around a fire, sharing a meager 
               supper. The man named Greil pokes at the stew-pot.

                                     GREIL
                         I left my farm with seeds unplanted, 
                         calves unborn, nothing but a wife to 
                         chase down the strays, and for what? 
                         A funeral, that's what.

               He walks up and down behind Valerian.

                                     GREIL
                         Because some people said, find a 
                         magician. Not just a local fellow, 
                         an import, a good forty leagues from 
                         home. An all-powerful necromancer. 
                         Ha -- some necromancer!

               Malkin, an older man, speaks up.

                                     MALKIN
                         Hold your tongue, Greil. Sit. Eat.

                                     GREIL
                         I'll not sit. I'll not eat. See you 
                         the Great Bear. His tail points east. 
                         It's the equinox. Have you forgotten? 
                         Or rather not think about it?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (miserable)
                         He's right. I brought us here for 
                         nothing. May the gods help whoever's 
                         daughter it is tonight.

               There is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire. Two 
               of the men get to their feet and listen. At first silence, 
               then more rustling. Without a word the two men dart into the 
               bushes and haul two interlopers before the company: Galen 
               and Hodge.

                                     HODGE
                         Good morrow, good morrow. Peace be 
                         with you.

                                     GALEN
                         Easy now. We mean no harm. We've 
                         been looking for you.

                                     GREIL
                              (growl)
                         Well, you've found us.

                                     GALEN
                              (brushing himself off)
                         More the other way around, I'd say.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What do you want?

                                     GALEN
                         A few words, that's all. You were 
                         looking for a conjurer.

                                     VALERIAN
                         He's dead.

                                     GALEN
                         Right. Requiscat in pace.
                              (he takes a deep breath)
                         Ecce: magister novus!

                                     GREIL
                         How say you?

               Galen surveys the puzzled faces. He draws himself up and 
               plunges in:

                                     GALEN
                         My lord Ulrich is no longer. All 
                         that you asked of him, you may now 
                         expect of me. The dangers he would 
                         face, I will now conquer. The task 
                         he would undertake I will now fulfill. 
                         I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of 
                         Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I 
                         am the Sorcerer you seek.

               There is a moment of depressed silence. Hodge rolls his eyes. 
               Greil starts to chuckle, then to laugh. Soon the others are 
               laughing too.

                                     GREIL
                         Well, that's a handsome thought, O 
                         wizard of wizards. But if there's 
                         one thing our friend Tyrian has shown 
                         us, it's to beware the pig in the 
                         poke. Who's got a dagger?

                                     HODGE
                         No tests!!

                                     GREIL
                         Call it proof, then.

               Someone brings out a dagger and hands it to Greil. Valerian 
               pushes it away.

                                     VALERIAN
                         We've seen enough tests.

               But Greil persists, waving the knife at the group.

                                     GREIL
                         Well I haven't. All I've seen is 
                         death. Death in our families, death 
                         on the road, and tonight, death at 
                         home.

               He lashes out with the knife. Galen jumps back, but Valerian 
               steps in, delivering a quick kick to Greil's gut, followed 
               by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man sprawling. 
               He takes the knife.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's come over you, anyway? Have 
                         you lost your wits?

               He propels Galen out of harm's way and sits him down on the 
               other side of the fire. Greil nurses his jaw.

                                     GREIL
                         I don't like it. Young snot-nose 
                         comes in here for sport at our 
                         expense. We're on a fool's errand, 
                         but we don't have to listen to this. 
                         I don't want to hear any more about 
                         sorcery. I don't want to hear any 
                         more about spells.

               Valerian hands Galen a plate of food.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You must be hungry.

                                     GALEN
                              (nods)
                         What's the matter with him?

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's not just him. It's all of us. 
                         It's the equinox.

               They both look up at the moon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT

               The moon shines down on the far reaches of the Kingdom of 
               Urland, coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the 
               skeletons of dead trees, blackened rock and bare ground. 
               Advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed 
               men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril. The horse is 
               skittish. Finally, in spite of shouts and lashings, it refuses 
               to go further. The leader, Horsrik, barks out an order:

                                     HORSRIK
                         Close enough! Bring her out!

               A young woman, no more than seventeen, is brought forth from 
               the cart. Long black hair falls down over a white tunic. Her 
               dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face. She is 
               half-carried, half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack 
               in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post. By 
               lantern-light, Horsrik reads from a parchment scroll.

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom, that this maiden, having 
                         lawfully been chosen by a deed of 
                         fortune and destiny, shall hereby 
                         give up her life for the greater 
                         good of Urland.

               There is a low rumble; the earth shakes. Horsrik glances 
               nervously around. He carries on by rote.

                                     HORSRIK
                         By this act shall be satisfied the 
                         powers that dwell underground and 
                         the spirits that attend thereto. In 
                         gratitude for this sacrifice His 
                         Majesty has declared the family -- 
                         what's the name? --

               He prods the girl, but she is too terrified to speak. Beneath 
               them, the earth seems to groan. Smoke issues from the mouth 
               of the pit. One of the nervous witnesses leans forward.

                                     RETAINER
                         Plowman! The family Plowman!

                                     HORSRIK
                              (rushing it)
                         -- the family Plowman to be free of 
                         obligations, taxations, levys and 
                         imposts for a period not to exceed 
                         five years...

               The horse suddenly rears, and blindfold notwithstanding, 
               gallops off, dragging the tumbril over the rocks. The men 
               behind Horsrik break ranks and scatter.

                                     HORSRIK
                         -- ordained and signed this day, 
                         etc., Casiodorus, in his glory the 
                         reigning king of this our realm... 
                         his seal, his mark, duly read by 
                         Chancellor Horsrik in his holy name.

               Now Horsrik joins the flight, chasing his men back over the 
               murky horizon.

               THE GIRL

               She strains against her manacles, cocking her head to listen 
               as the rumblings below subside. Presently the steam and smoke 
               blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a 
               hundred yards distant, the wheel of the cart jammed between 
               rocks. Summoning up a wild will to live, she squeezes her 
               hands against the cold iron rings. No use. She spits on her 
               wrists and twists desperately. Blood starts. One hand slips 
               free. She looks at the horse. The animal tosses off its 
               blindfold and looks back at her. Now she strains again and 
               pulls her other hand free. She wipes the blood on her frock 
               and sprints toward the horse. But she doesn't get there. The 
               earth abruptly shifts from under her feet, tumbling her among 
               cracked and steaming rocks. When she raises her head a huge 
               shadow has fallen over the horse. There is a piteous whinny, 
               then a roar. The girl's face is suddenly lit by flames. She 
               scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way.

               THE CHASE

               The girl hasn't taken a dozen steps when something huge 
               hurtles forward and blocks her way. Something scaly and 
               glittering. She whirls and stumbles off in a new direction. 
               This time she's cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier-
               like talons. She screams and crawls away. Another claw 
               prevents her escape.

               THE CREATURE

               Membranous wings fold down against the night sky. Up comes 
               the silhouette of a reptilian head swaying on a serpentine 
               neck. There's an angry hiss. A sheet of flame envelops 
               everything.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               FOREST - DAY

               Tyrian kneels beside a mountain waterfall, having a drink 
               while his men hover in the background. One of them points 
               down the slope.

                                     MAN
                         There. I see them.

               Tyrian wipes his mouth unhurriedly and strolls over to look. 
               Far below, half hidden by trees, the little company of 
               Urlanders winds its way through the forest.

               A frown creeps over Tyrian's face.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Who's that old man?

                                     MAN
                         Where? Which one?

                                     TYRIAN
                         That one. That's the man from 
                         Cragganmore. Now what's he doing 
                         here?

                                     MAN
                         Filling in for the chief, I reckon.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (weary)
                         What a pity.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HODGE

               Hodge marches along with the rest. When he's sure no one 
               else is looking he burrows into his garments and brings out 
               the leather pouch containing Ulrich's ashes. Reassured that 
               it's still with him, he tucks it away again. Galen falls 
               into step.

                                     GALEN
                         What have you got there?

                                     HODGE
                         None of your business.

                                     GALEN
                         A little gold, eh? What do you say I 
                         change it into lead?

                                     HODGE
                         Save your jokes for someone else. 
                         Me, I don't care for braggarts.

               They pass Valerian, who has dropped out of line.

                                     HODGE
                         And I don't care for frauds.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm no fraud.

                                     HODGE
                         Call it fool then. Upstart. Whatever 
                         pleases you.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge, nobody forced you to come 
                         along.

                                     HODGE
                         Oh, I'm here of my own free will, 
                         all right. We each do the master's 
                         bidding in our own way.

                                     GALEN
                         Well, if he told you I needed 
                         wetnursing, why don't you just turn 
                         yourself around and go back home.

               Hodge snorts and fusses with his pack.

                                     HODGE
                         Home, is it? You've seen to that, 
                         haven't you? Gone to seed, I'd say...

               He glances over and discovers Galen missing.

               GALEN

               He walks back along the trail, looking for Valerian. Pretty 
               soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight. He hears 
               the sound of a splash. He turns off the trail and pushes 
               through some shrubbery.

               FOREST POOL

               Under the oaks and hickory, a forest stream has widened into 
               a quiet pool. A pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge. 
               Out in the middle, Valerian is treading water.

                                     GALEN
                         You're too far behind us. Come on 
                         out.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You go ahead, I'll catch up.

                                     GALEN
                         Not a good idea to get separated. 
                         Let's go.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Right. I'll be along.

               Galen leans over and splashes some water on his face. Feels 
               good. He shucks his pack and starts to throw off his clothes. 
               Valerian doesn't like it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's all right. Don't come in.

               But Galen is now naked and walking into the water. He swims 
               out toward Valerian.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (edgy)
                         You better get back to the group, 
                         they're probably worried.

               Galen keeps swimming.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I prefer to swim alone, if you don't 
                         mind.

               But Galen has slipped beneath the surface; he doesn't hear.

               UNDERWATER

               Galen works his way through the murky green underwater world. 
               Suddenly, he stops short and stares. He's only a few feet 
               from Valerian's dangling legs. He gasps in surprise. Valerian 
               is no boy.

               ON THE SURFACE

               Galen comes shooting to the surface, coughing and sputtering.

                                     GALEN
                         By the gods!

               Valerian is pale and frightened.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Stay away.

               She propels herself backward, then turns and swims for shore.

               ON THE SHORE

               Galen and Valerian have taken refuge behind separate bushes. 
               Briskly they pull on their clothes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I suppose you'll tell everyone. Go 
                         ahead, I don't care. It's a relief.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm not going to say anything.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't blame you. I was stupid. 
                         Careless. A silly woman!

                                     GALEN
                              (feeble bluff)
                         Take it easy. I knew the moment I 
                         saw you. I've known the whole time.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You never knew a thing. No one knew. 
                         Not since I was born. Go on, run off 
                         and tell them. It'll make a great 
                         story.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't worry. No one's going to find 
                         out. Just tell me: why?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Ask my father.

               They finish dressing in silence. Finally:

                                     GALEN
                         The lottery! Daughters are chosen, 
                         but sons are not!

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's right. Unless you have plenty 
                         of gold or property.

                                     GALEN
                         What do you mean?

                                     VALERIAN
                         If you're rich enough, your name 
                         never goes in.
                              (bitter)
                         My father is poor. So are a lot of 
                         fathers.

               He studies her. She jams a hat down over her head and, once 
               more the young man, stalks off.

               THE VISION

               Galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his 
               pack. As he leans over he catches sight of what appears to 
               be a reflection in the water: Tyrian on horseback. He whips 
               around, but no one is behind him. Riveted by the vision, he 
               hurries along the bank to follow it. After a few paces the 
               blurry figure dismounts, unslings a longbow, nocks an arrow 
               and draws the string taut.

                                     GALEN
                              (horrified)
                         No!

               FOREST

               Galen sprints through the trees. Up ahead is Valerian, walking 
               resolutely.

                                     GALEN
                         No!

               She glances back at him and grimly keeps on walking. Galen 
               shoots past her and on into the forest.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge!

               TRAVELERS

               Galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the Urlanders 
               coming toward him. Hodge precedes the group with an unsteady 
               gait. He sees Galen, raises up his arms and flops face down 
               on the trail. A long arrow protrudes from his back. Galen 
               kneels beside him. The uneasy company keeps its distance. 
               Hodge struggles to speak.

                                     HODGE
                         Galen? Can you hear me?

                                     GALEN
                         I hear you.

                                     HODGE
                         You know, somebody shot me, but I 
                         can still talk. There's something 
                         that has to be done.

                                     GALEN
                         I know.

                                     HODGE
                         Not that cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes. 
                         Here.

               Hodge's hand comes out from under his coat gripping the 
               leather pouch. Galen tugs at it, but Hodge can't let go.

                                     HODGE
                         Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel 
                         it loose.

               Galen pries the sack out of Hodge's clenched fingers. Suddenly 
               the hand comes up, grabs Galen by the hair, and pulls him 
               near.

                                     HODGE
                              (a croak)
                         ...burning water... find the lake, 
                         throw it in...

                                     GALEN
                              (holding up the pouch)
                         What are you doing with this, Hodge?

                                     HODGE
                         ...burning water...

               He dies. Galen frees himself from his grasp.

                                     GALEN
                         Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're 
                         not going to die.

               Galen is frantic. He pulls out the amulet and wraps his hand 
               around it.

                                     GALEN
                         Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!
                              (he shakes the body)
                         Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!

               But Hodge has passed on, and Galen's magic has no way to 
               reach him. Suddenly the youth cries out in pain. He drops 
               the amulet and looks at his palm. The device has burned his 
               flesh. Now he becomes aware of troubled Urlanders looking 
               over his shoulder, witness to his failure.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LAKE - DAY

               Wind whips the leaden wave tops on a vast rainy lake. The 
               travelers are rowing across in an open longboat, aided by a 
               tattered lateen sail. Valerian mans the steering oar at the 
               stern while Galen broods in the bow. He feels like an imposter 
               in their eyes.

               FJORD

               The boat pulls into a long narrow waterway with granite cliffs 
               on either side. Moving through swirls of fog, they beach the 
               boat and step out onto a craggy shore. Greil leans over and 
               kisses a rock.

                                     GREIL
                         Urland!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               The travelers descend a mountain pass and emerge through a 
               wrack of cloud into a gray and cheerless region. Fire-
               blackened trees dot the barren landscape. As they reach the 
               flatlands, the Urlanders instinctively pick up the pace. 
               Galen slows to inspect the weird surroundings. Valerian trots 
               past him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Come on. Don't dawdle here.

               Galen falls into step with her.

                                     GALEN
                         The whole kingdom like this?

                                     VALERIAN
                         No. We're near the lair. Keep moving.

               Galen looks around with new interest.

                                     GALEN
                         Where?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Over there. Doesn't matter. We're in 
                         no danger if we just pass through 
                         quickly.

               Galen stops. High on the slope beside them is a gaping 
               fissure.

                                     GALEN
                         I see it. Let's have a look.

                                     VALERIAN
                         No!

               But Galen is already toiling up the incline.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Greil! Malkin! Help!

               The travelers turn to see what's the matter.

               THE LAIR

               Galen approaches the lair, pausing beside a wooden post with 
               iron manacles dangling from it. He fingers them thoughtfully. 
               Malkin, Greil and Valerian rush up behind him, their faces 
               drawn with worry.

                                     GREIL
                         Look, you don't have to do this. We 
                         know you're a fine young magician. 
                         None better. There's no need to prove 
                         it to us.

                                     GALEN
                         Are there other entrances?

                                     VALERIAN
                         No. One's enough.

                                     GREIL
                         Come on. The road's this way. We'll 
                         tell everybody how close you got.

                                     GALEN
                              (coolly)
                         No smoke. How do you know it's in 
                         there?

                                     GREIL
                         Don't be a fool. Come away now and 
                         live to tell about it.

               Instead, Galen starts into the crack. Greil and Malkin hasten 
               away, but Valerian lingers, watching in mounting frustration 
               as Galen probes further and further into the lair. She picks 
               up a fistful of stones and throws them at him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Go ahead! You're going to die! What 
                         a fine trick that will be!

               But Galen is lost in the gloom. She flees.

               UNDERGROUND

               Galen puts his hand on the rugged wall: the rocks are hot to 
               the touch. Something glinting on the floor catches Galen's 
               eye: an irridescent disk, a dragon scale. It flashes the 
               colors of the rainbow as Galen examines it. All at once the 
               ground shudders; chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. A 
               pall of smoke billows up from the depths.

               OUTSIDE

               Galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a 
               swirl of smoke. There is no sign of the Urlanders. He throws 
               down his pack, climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the 
               massive cliffs rising behind the lair. He grasps the amulet 
               and closes his eyes.

                                     GALEN
                         Now, great mountain, hear my command: 
                         Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum 
                         draconis! Evanescat latibulum 
                         draconis!

               LANDSLIDE

               With a thunderous splitting sound, the entire top of the 
               cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the 
               mountain, sweeping tons of debris into the air. Boulders the 
               size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician. 
               Eyes wide with awe, he turns and runs for his life. Even as 
               he careens down the slope, chunks of rock rumble past. One 
               catches him at the knee and sends him flying.

               He covers his head and joins the landslide. Finally the dust 
               lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the 
               cowering Urlanders. They look with real fear at the man who 
               just conjured up the Apocalypse. Tattered and torn, covered 
               with dirt, Galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at 
               his handiwork.

               LANDSCAPE

               The territory has been drastically transformed: the dragon's 
               lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite. 
               The Urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction. 
               Galen grins a triumphant split-lip grin that fails to win 
               them over. Presently they back away and run off down the 
               trail, Valerian in their midst. Galen's grin fades.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - DAY

               The Village of Swanscombe is little more than a rough and 
               ready collection of thatched huts and mud-daubed outbuildings 
               surrounded by cultivated fields. Dogs sleep in open door-
               ways; chickens peck around the communal well -- but there 
               are no people in evidence as Valerian and her company troop 
               into town.

               VALERIAN

               She trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith 
               shop.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father? Hello?

               She goes over to the forge. Hot coals are burning. She becomes 
               aware of a sound -- voices -- chanting.

               SQUARE

               She walks across the square toward the voices. She is joined 
               by Greil, Malkin and the other travelers, all of them puzzled 
               by the desolation. As they approach the grange hall the voices 
               grow louder. They seem to be singing. The main doors open 
               briefly and three villagers scamper out, dripping wet and 
               wrapped in white muslin. Valerian and her companions look at 
               each other in astonishment.

               IN THE GRANGE HALL

               In a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is 
               being held under water. After a few moments she is pulled to 
               the surface by a tall red-haired man with long bony fingers: 
               Brother Jacopus Januensis, a Carthusian monk. There's a wooden 
               cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye. Gathered around 
               him are the missing villagers, every man woman and child, 
               here to be baptised and sing a few newly-learned hymns in 
               praise of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Now are you cleansed of your sins! 
                         Now are you born again, purified in 
                         spirit, into the fellowship of Jesus 
                         Christ!

               The travelers enter and mingle with the congregation. Valerian 
               scans the crowd until she locates her father, Simon, a balding 
               sturdy journeyman. He's overjoyed at her return and gives 
               her a hearty embrace.

                                     SIMON
                         Welcome back, my son.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father, what are you doing? Have you 
                         all lost your minds?

                                     SIMON
                         Some have.

               He points to the monk, who is dunking a screaming infant and 
               carrying on about the Bishop of Rome.

                                     SIMON
                         It's this monk. He can read and write, 
                         and talk too, I'm afraid.

                                     VALERIAN
                         And they listen?

                                     SIMON
                         Shh! They think this a holy place, a 
                         tabernacle.

                                     VALERIAN
                         This is the granary. What kind of 
                         welcome is this? I've got news of 
                         the sorcerer and news of the dragon.

                                     SIMON
                         You were brave to go, you and your 
                         friends. But nobody cares. Listen -- 
                         he knows what they want to hear.

               MONK

               Brother Jacopus strides back and forth before the assembly 
               in an inspired state.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         The man who walks with Christ is not 
                         a man to fear a dragon: Yea, though 
                         I walk through the valley of the 
                         shadow of death I will fear no evil! 
                         You say you are preyed upon by a 
                         foul beast. Yes, but what is the 
                         nature of this beast? It comes to 
                         you on bat's wings and clawed feet, 
                         does it not? It breathes fire, does 
                         it not? And it lives under ground. 
                         This is no dragon. This is Lucifer!

                                     VOICE
                         Whoever it is, he's dead.

               This is Galen, who has just stepped into the hall, tattered, 
               bedraggled and triumphant.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Nay, brother! It is not as easy as 
                         that. Allegiance to Christ, to be 
                         sure, but also prayer and confession. 
                         These are the arms by which Satan 
                         may be put down.

                                     GALEN
                         You're talking about superstition, 
                         friend. None of that has anything to 
                         do with what I, Galen, have already 
                         achieved.

               He marches to the center of the gathering.

                                     SIMON
                              (to Valerian)
                         You brought this stranger?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Ulrich's apprentice. He's a braggart, 
                         but it doesn't matter.

                                     GALEN
                         People of Urland! Send a messenger 
                         to the king. Vermithrax is dead. 
                         Crushed by the power of the moon and 
                         the stars! Laid low by ancient wisdom. 
                         Dropped into the Abyss by mystical 
                         practice.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Spoken like a pagan. Every word as 
                         reprobate as it is false!
                              (holding up his cross)
                         Solum in hoc signo vinces!

                                     GALEN
                         Nihil plus mysterium!

               He gestures boldly and a fireball crackles at the monk's 
               feet. The holy man scurries back. A hush falls upon the 
               congregation.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               A procession of curious villagers winds its way into the 
               badlands. They gather on a promontory overlooking the dragon's 
               lair. They stand there for a long time, a chill wind whipping 
               their garments, trying to understand what's happened. The 
               monk is mightily displeased.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Praise God! Blessed is he that is 
                         humble before the Lord!

                                     VALERIAN
                         Your god had nothing to do with it.

               Indeed, Galen's act is already the stuff of legend:

                                     MALKIN
                         We saw it with our own eyes. He flew 
                         to the mountain top. He was a bird. 
                         He brought forth lightning. I saw 
                         it.

               Some of the younger villagers scamper forward to the spot 
               where the cave had its opening. With yells and whoops they 
               beat the ground with clubs. In the crowd Simon begins to 
               smile, then to laugh. Soon he leads the villagers in a 
               tumultuous cheer. Brother Jacopus and some of his converts 
               drop to their knees and pray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CELEBRATION

               The inhabitants of Swanscombe have decked out the town square 
               and are making a night of it. By torchlight they dance merrily 
               to jigs and reels provided by the local fiddlers. Ale flows 
               freely from oak casks.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               Valerian is kneeling before a trunk full of women's clothing. 
               She pulls out a long simple frock, goes to a crude mirror, 
               and holds it up against her body to gauge the effect. Her 
               father comes up behind her. He is angry and frightened.

                                     SIMON
                         Put that away. What if you were seen?

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm going to be seen. I want to be 
                         seen. Tonight the world finds out 
                         that you never had a son.

                                     SIMON
                         No, you mustn't do that. It's too 
                         soon. We've got to think about this, 
                         we've got to make a plan.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Father: the danger is over.

               He sits on the bed and puts his head in his hands.

                                     SIMON
                         I know. What am I going to say to my 
                         friends who still mourn for their 
                         lost girls.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You'll say you did what you had to. 
                         This is a time for celebration -- 
                         and forgiveness.

               He looks up at her, trying to imagine what it's going to be 
               like having a daughter.

               CELEBRATION

               Galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed kids and not a 
               few adults, entertaining them by pulling duck's eggs out of 
               their ears and causing coins to disappear. Presently he feels 
               the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing 
               behind him. He turns to find a shy but determined Valerian 
               sweetly decked out in her blue frock. A buzz goes through 
               the crowd. Valerian blushes and wavers: she seems ready to 
               bolt for home. But Galen takes her by the hand, and with 
               conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance.

               DANCE

               It's forward, back and around sixth-century style: the young 
               sorcerer can't take his eyes off his partner. But she's too 
               shy to return his gaze.

                                     GALEN
                         Looks like you've been up to a little 
                         sorcery yourself.

               Valerian doesn't know what to say.

                                     GALEN
                         Or is it witchcraft?

               She still doesn't reply. It's all she can do to keep on 
               dancing.

                                     GALEN
                         What's the matter? A real woman never 
                         stops talking.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I think it was much easier being a 
                         boy.

               SIMON & GREIL

               They stand on the sidelines, watching the young couple step 
               to the music.

                                     SIMON
                         The damnedest thing is, she was twice 
                         the man of anyone else in the village. 
                         Now she's twice the woman.

                                     GREIL
                              (grim)
                         Would that I had been as clever as 
                         her father.

                                     SIMON
                         Come now, Greil. Don't begrudge a 
                         life spared.

                                     GREIL
                         I begrudge nothing. But I wonder at 
                         what we have seen and how it was 
                         done.

                                     SIMON
                         You were there.

                                     GREIL
                         I saw what I saw. But this jack-anapes 
                         was barely ready to carry his master's 
                         chamberpot. Isn't it strange that at 
                         the very moment the beast is put 
                         down we should have a holy man here 
                         in the village?

                                     SIMON
                         You don't believe that superstitious 
                         Christian rot, do you?

                                     GREIL
                              (defensive)
                         It is said God works his wonders in 
                         mysterious ways.

               CELEBRATION

               While the proud Simon dances in the background with his 
               daughter, a group of tipsy villagers clusters around Galen, 
               belching forth a drinking song. The young magician raises 
               his own mug and joins in on the chorus. Abruptly the music 
               stops. The singing dies away. The ensuing silence is broken 
               by the sound of galloping hooves. Presently three horsemen 
               appear at the end of town: Tyrian and his henchmen. They 
               guide their horses forward into the midst of the merry-makers. 
               Tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way.

                                     TYRIAN
                         A celebration! Don't stop on my 
                         account. You -- musicians, more music!

               The musicians leave their instruments in their laps. Tyrian 
               draws himself a measure of ale and raises it above his head.

                                     TYRIAN
                         A toast! To the deed of the day! You 
                         see, good news travels fast. The 
                         King himself has already heard it. 
                         And like yourselves, tonight he's 
                         overcome with joy.

                                     MALKIN
                         What would you have of us then?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Not a thing. It's this one.
                              (he gestures toward 
                              Galen)
                         The King would meet our new benefactor 
                         and offer his gratitude to the man 
                         who succeeded where so many have 
                         failed.

                                     GALEN
                              (sobering up)
                         What sort of gratitude? A knife in 
                         the belly? An arrow in the back?

               Tyrian's smile freezes on his face. He steps in front of 
               Galen, towering over him.

                                     TYRIAN
                         My young friend, I'd as soon dispatch 
                         you as I did the others, and for the 
                         same reason. But his Majesty would 
                         like a cozy chat, and commands 
                         otherwise.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Don't go, Galen. Cast a spell and 
                         turn them into toads. It should be 
                         easy; that's what they are.

               Tyrian regards her coolly, taking in her change of costume 
               and its meaning.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Well, well: still plenty of cheek 
                         under those skirts, it seems.

               Having buried the dragon under a mountain, Galen decides 
               he's not worried about an appearance at court. He smiles at 
               Valerian.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't worry. I'll be back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               RIDERS

               Three horses gallop through the moors and fens of central 
               Urland. Galen is tucked up behind Tyrian. On the distant 
               horizon, the battlements of the King's castle glow in the 
               slanting light of a new day.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THRONE ROOM - DAY

               Within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight 
               poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls. In 
               the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne. There is 
               Casiodorus Rex, King of Urland, a bearded man in his fifties, 
               as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. He is 
               flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and Tyrian. 
               Standing before them all is Galen, looking unhappy. He pours 
               a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet.

                                     GALEN
                         One of the best things about the 
                         water here in Urland is that there's 
                         so much of it -- look at that!

               Water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing. 
               Galen takes a sip.

                                     GALEN
                         Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. 
                         Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from 
                         his Majesty.

               The King makes no sign. Galen approaches stiffly, takes a 
               scarf and retreats.

                                     GALEN
                         I cover the goblet, so... remove, 
                         so... and behold: winter in a mug!

               And he's done it: he turns the goblet over and a small chunk 
               of ice hits the floor. The royal reaction is equally frosty. 
               Galen is bombing, and he knows it.

                                     GALEN
                         All right. How many of you have ever 
                         seen a table fly?

               He mutters an incantation. In the audience, Tyrian notes 
               that Galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet. There is 
               a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins 
               to jitter and buck. As the wine spills and plates go flying, 
               the King wearily raises a hand.

                                     KING
                         Enough! That's fine.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait, it'll rise now.

                                     KING
                         Don't bother. Not necessary.

               The table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and 
               crockery at the onlookers' feet.

                                     KING
                         Tell me: the landslide -- it was 
                         accomplished this same way?

                                     GALEN
                         Yes.

                                     KING
                         I see. And having rendered such unique 
                         service to our kingdom, what would 
                         you claim as a reward?

                                     GALEN
                         Please -- no payment. I have always 
                         found magical practice to be its own 
                         reward. I seek only some yet greater 
                         challenge.

               This handsome sentiment doesn't go over any better than his 
               tricks.

                                     KING
                         Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric? 
                         Of course not, you weren't even born. 
                         He was my brother, a great King and 
                         a valiant man-at-arms. When he 
                         ascended to the throne, the dragon 
                         was unbridled. No one knew where it 
                         might strike next. So he brought 
                         forth his broadsword and his spear, 
                         assembled a company of his best 
                         fighters and went out to do battle.
                              (pause)
                         He was never seen again. But his 
                         attack provoked the most terrible 
                         reprisals: whole villages incinerated, 
                         entire crops burned. Death, famine, 
                         horrible.

               The King grimaces as the memories come flooding back.

                                     KING
                              (quietly)
                         How did you arrogate to yourself the 
                         role of savior?

                                     GALEN
                         I was invited.

                                     KING
                         Not by me. Did you ever consider the 
                         consequences of failure?

                                     GALEN
                         What failure? What's the matter with 
                         you people? You want the dragon back?

                                     KING
                         Then the beast is dead?

                                     GALEN
                         Yes, of course. Dead.

                                     KING
                         We shall see.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DUNGEON

               Two guards thrust Galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred 
               door shut. The young sorcerer waits until they're safely out 
               of sight, then takes out his amulet. He ponders it for a 
               doubtful moment. Suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips 
               it off his neck and out through the bars.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Thank you.

               He makes an ironic salute and leaves. Galen sits down heavily 
               and stares at the stone walls.

               CORRIDOR

               Unseen by Galen, a figure clad in silk and lace skitters 
               down a murky dungeon hallway and peers around a corner. 
               Stealing a look at Galen is the Princess Elspeth, a fey beauty 
               in her early twenties. After a moment, spooked by some 
               imagined noise, she flits away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Dark clouds slide across a pale sun, throwing the ruined 
               land below into shadow. Soon fat droplets of rain are 
               splattering on the rocks above the dragon's lair. With each 
               tiny splash there is a sizzle and a puff of steam. These 
               rocks are hot!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DUNGEON

               Outside the barred window, a steady rain is falling. Inside, 
               Galen uses a chunk of limestone to inscribe a pentagram on 
               the floor of his cell. He marks runic signs on the window 
               sill and lintel. Then, positioning himself in the center of 
               the mystic symbol, he raises his hands and spreads his 
               fingers.

                                     GALEN
                              (authoritative)
                         Cubiculum gravis aperat!

               There's a long moment when nothing happens. A very long 
               moment. Finally, a thoroughly frustrated Galen leaps to the 
               window and rattles the bars.

                                     GALEN
                         Open up, dammit! Fenestra gravis 
                         aperat! Asser gravis aperat! 
                         Divinitus!

                                     VOICE
                         Salve, magistrum iuvenilum.

               Startled, Galen whirls around to find Elspeth standing outside 
               his cell. She hands some food and blankets through the bars.

                                     ELSPETH
                         I've studied Latin. Greek, too. Me 
                         appelo Elspeth, filia regis.

               Galen looks her over. He's never seen anyone so angelic.

                                     GALEN
                         How do you do.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Please don't think ill of us. My 
                         father is a wonderful man, a wise 
                         man. The lottery was his idea.

                                     GALEN
                         I see.

                                     ELSPETH
                         You don't understand. From the moment 
                         it began, the dragon was tame. The 
                         kingdom prospered.

                                     GALEN
                         And only a few had to be sacrificed.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Yes, that's true. Isn't it better 
                         that a few should die that many might 
                         live?

                                     GALEN
                         Depends on who does the dying.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Oh, but we all take our chances. My 
                         father is a just man. My name is 
                         entered on the lists, along with 
                         every other young --

                                     GALEN
                         Virgin?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Maiden.

                                     GALEN
                         If you say so.

                                     ELSPETH
                         What do you mean?

                                     GALEN
                              (sighs)
                         Nothing.

                                     ELSPETH
                         I've participated in every drawing 
                         since I came of age.

                                     GALEN
                         Maybe.

                                     ELSPETH
                         It's true. You don't believe me. You 
                         think I'm lying. Well I'm not.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families 
                         with money, that sort of thing.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Don't listen to rumors. They're lies. 
                         I have to go now.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait -- how long do I have to stay 
                         in here?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Until we know. Not long. Goodbye. 
                         Vale. Dormi bene.

               She slips away down the corridor.

               LIBRARY

               King Casiodorus and Tyrian are huddled over a table piled 
               high with manuscripts and papers. Tyrian clears a spot and 
               sets out a stack of lead bars.

                                     KING
                         That's enough. Let's not be greedy 
                         here.

               The King picks up Galen's amulet, and holds it over the bars 
               in his clenched fist.

                                     KING
                         Now then: I, Casiodorus Rex do hereby 
                         command thou base metal to change 
                         thy essence and become gold.

               There is a rustle of skirts and Elspeth appears behind him.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Father?

                                     KING
                         Not now. Tyrian, remove all but one 
                         bar. We'll try it one at a time.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Father: did you know that some 
                         families have paid bribes to stay 
                         out of the lottery?

               The King and Tyrian glance up at her.

                                     KING
                         Nonsense. By the power of this amulet, 
                         justly wielded by my hand in 
                         accordance with the laws of Urland, 
                         now lead be thou gold.

               The lead remains unchanged, but the King gives out a cry and 
               drops the amulet.

                                     KING
                         I'm burned! What devilish thing is 
                         this?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Have you ever kept my name off the 
                         lottery list?

                                     KING
                         That'll be all, Tyrian. You may 
                         withdraw.

               Tyrian bows and exits. The King uses his sceptre to pick up 
               the amulet and chain. He conceals it in a hollowed-out book 
               and places the volume on a shelf among many others.

                                     KING
                         Now, my dear, what's troubling you?

                                     ELSPETH
                         Answer my question: am I not exposed 
                         to the same risk as every other man's 
                         daughter?

               The King paces over to the window and stares out. The rain 
               has stopped.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Well?

                                     KING
                              (finally)
                         Your father loves you very much.

               Elspeth sways in dismay.

                                     ELSPETH
                              (a wail)
                         It's true! What have you done to 
                         me!?

                                     KING
                         Who fills your head with such ideas?

               At that moment a tremor passes through the room. King and 
               daughter look at each other in alarm.

               DUNGEON

               The same tremor shakes the bars in Galen's cell. Puzzled, he 
               rolls off his straw palette and gets to his feet. The tremor 
               dies away. Suddenly a violent shaking hits the cell, bouncing 
               Galen off the walls.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE SQUARE

               Swanscombe is gripped by the same earthquake. Dodging panicky 
               barnyard animals, Valerian and her father join other 
               frightened villagers in the center of town.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY

               Above the dragon's lair, boulders are shifting and grinding 
               together. Massive chunks of stone break loose and tumble 
               down the incline.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GALEN

               The shaking has stopped. Rock dust filters down from the 
               ceiling. Galen picks himself up and stares: the door to his 
               cell is off its hinges and is sagging open. He darts out.

               CORRIDOR

               Galen dashes along the hallway, rounds a corner and stops. 
               At the other end of the passage is Tyrian.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You little meddler! It's alive!

               He draws his sword and advances. Galen warily retreats. Tyrian 
               breaks into a run. Galen turns and sprints away.

               COURTYARD

               Unruly horses, terrified by the quake, rush blindly around 
               the courtyard. Hostlers try vainly to catch them. Tyrian 
               leans down from an upstairs window.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Close the main gate! Quick!

               The men below scramble for the gates. Galen bursts out of 
               hiding, sees the untended horses, and swings aboard as one 
               goes past. A cry goes up from the guards.

                                     TYRIAN
                         There! Stop him!

               Galen rides like mad for the exit, but he's a half-second 
               late: the doors boom shut in his face. He wheels the horse 
               around. The King's men are coming toward him with pikes. 
               Digging his heels into the horse's sides, he urges the animal 
               back across the courtyard, up the steps and right into the 
               building!

               THRONE ROOM

               Galen gallops into the empty chamber, knocking over the throne 
               and vaulting a table. Hot on his heels are armed soldiers. 
               He kicks the horse again and shoots under an archway.

               KITCHEN

               The kitchen is already in chaos from the earthquake when 
               Galen charges in on his wild steed. Food, utensils and cooks 
               go flying. He reins in, ducks his head, and squeezes the 
               horse out into a narrow hallway.

               HALLWAY

               He clatters down the passageway. But here comes a contingent 
               of footmen from the opposite direction. Galen rides them 
               into the walls!

               STAIRS

               The horse scrabbles up the stairs, Galen tucked low against 
               its neck. On the upper landing he comes face to face with 
               Tyrian and more soldiers.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Get him! Stab the horse!

               Galen jerks the animal around and plunges back down the 
               stairs.

               LIBRARY

               Whinnying and blowing the horse bursts in, a wild-eyed Galen 
               still in the saddle. He finds himself confronting the King 
               and his daughter.

               Casiodorus grabs Elspeth and retreats into a corner.

                                     KING
                         Tyrian! Tyrian!

               Tyrian sweeps in with his men. The doors slam shut.

                                     KING
                         So much for your magic! So much for 
                         your sorcery!

               Galen is trapped. Just as Tyrian reaches for the horse's 
               reins, the animal rears up, rolling its eyes. At that moment 
               the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks. The 
               men at arms go down like ten pins. Tyrian reels back, dodging 
               stone blocks loosened from the ceiling. As the shaking 
               continues, a weakened section of wall gives way. Galen sees 
               daylight! Without even waiting for the quake to cease, he 
               prods the horse across the room and through the wall to 
               freedom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               The unnerved citizens of Swanscombe gather on the promontory 
               overlooking Galen's landslide. Every few seconds there is a 
               new shudder and more rocks pour down the long slope. Valerian 
               stands trembling with her father. Presently Brother Jacopus 
               elbows his way forward.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Listen to me, my brethren. The moment 
                         of our fear is the moment of our 
                         triumph. This is a sign from God. 
                         Follow me, and our faith will send 
                         this creature straight to hell.

               Holding a cross before him, he starts up the slope. No one 
               follows. They haven't been Christians all that long. One or 
               two near Valerian get down on their knees and pray silently. 
               Greil looks things over.

                                     GREIL
                         You call yourselves Christians?

               He strides after the monk. But he's the only one.

               NEAR THE LAIR

               The determined monk has arrived at the epicenter. His sandals 
               are smoking on the hot gravel. Sweat shines on his face and 
               neck.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not 
                         want. Thou makest me to lie down in 
                         green pastures. Thy rod and staff 
                         they comfort me...

               Greil toils up the slope a hundred yards back. He's crossing 
               himself, but he's carrying a sickle.

               VERMITHRAX

               There is a thunderous noise. Part of the mountain is tossed 
               into the air. Up from the depths comes a huge shining wing. 
               Then a neck uncoils and a head appears. It tips down toward 
               the tiny human.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                              (firm)
                         ...for Thine is the kingdom and the 
                         power and the glory forever -- amen.

               At the base of the slope the villagers scatter. Greil wavers.

                                     BROTHER JACOPUS
                         Unclean beast, get thee down! Be 
                         thou consumed by the fires that made 
                         you!

               The dragon's head sways back and forth, then belches out a 
               waterfall of flame. It engulfs Jacopus and sends him to a 
               better world, if there is one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HILL ROAD - NIGHT

               Horse and rider race across a night landscape under brooding 
               clouds. Up ahead, the sky glows with an angry red light. At 
               the crest of a hill Galen reins in and looks down across a 
               long valley. There, miles away, is the village of Swanscombe. 
               Many buildings are ablaze. As he watches in horror, fires 
               spring up in the fields and trees. Intermittently he can see 
               the silhouette of the dragon as it spreads destruction. 
               Finally the creature swoops up and away. Galen stares skyward, 
               losing sight of it in the clouds. For a moment, silence. 
               Then, with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him 
               from the saddle, the dragon reappears and hurtles a few feet 
               over his head! It is gone in an instant.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Half the buildings in the town are on fire. Desperate 
               villagers dash here and there, herding children and animals 
               to safety, trying to save their household goods. Galen walks 
               woodenly into the confusion, leading his horse, taking in 
               the scope of the disaster. He comes upon a line of men who 
               have formed a bucket brigade. He attempts to join up. As 
               soon as he is recognized, he is shouldered roughly aside.

                                     MAN
                         Get away, you little bastard. We've 
                         had enough help from you.

               Galen staggers back, reaching for his horse. The animal shies 
               and trots off. A middle-aged woman appears in front of him, 
               her face contorted with rage. She swings a flaming broom and 
               catches him on the back of the head. Galen reels away.

                                     WOMAN
                         This is your doing!

               Galen looks up and sees a couple of burlies moving his way 
               with boards in their hands.

                                     BURLIES
                         Get him! He's back!

               Before they can get too close, Galen runs down an alley and 
               bumps smack into a glassy-eyed, haunted man. It is Greil.

                                     GALEN
                         Greil -- help!

                                     GREIL
                         May the Lord forgive you for what 
                         you have done.

               He pushes past. Galen ducks behind a smoldering building.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               The roof has burned off, but at least the walls are standing. 
               Valerian is wrestling charred timbers out of the center of 
               the room. She is covered with soot. There is a hammering on 
               the door and Galen barges in. He slams the door behind him 
               and puts his back against it.

                                     GALEN
                         It's me. Are you hurt?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Where have you been? Doesn't matter -- 
                         listen: Quick! Make it rain. That'll 
                         put the fire out.

                                     GALEN
                         I can't.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Then get the animals back. They're 
                         all running loose. There's people 
                         been hurt. Stop their pain. You can 
                         cure them. And we'll need food...

                                     GALEN
                         I can't do it.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (this stops her)
                         What? Why not?

               Galen's hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang.

                                     GALEN
                         I just can't.

                                     VALERIAN
                         But you're a sorcerer.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I 
                         might have had, it's gone.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It can't be!

                                     GALEN
                         I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A 
                         fake. I'm sorry...

               For a moment, Valerian is too stunned to speak. Then her 
               face colors.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You're sorry?! Listen to that! The 
                         damn thing is loose, we're all on 
                         fire and you're sorry!

               Galen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You didn't have the faintest idea 
                         what you were doing, did you? You're 
                         a fool -- and I'm a bigger one for 
                         bringing you here.

               She snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't want you in this house. Get 
                         out.

               But Galen still sits there like a puppet with its strings 
               cut, every dream of glory utterly crushed. This piteous sight 
               touches Valerian's heart. Her gaze softens. She slowly lowers 
               the pitchfork.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               A knot of villagers lead Tyrian and his henchmen across the 
               square directly to the blacksmith's shop. The King's men 
               dismount and pound on the door. It swings open. Valerian is 
               standing there.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Where is he?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not here. I can't help you.

               A cry goes up from the villagers. They know damn well he's 
               in there.

               VALERIAN'S HOUSE

               Tyrian pushes Valerian aside and steps into the room. Aided 
               by some townfolk, his men proceed to ransack the premises, 
               overturning barrels, sticking their swords through flour 
               sacks, poking through the tumbledown thatch. Valerian's eye 
               falls on Malkin, who has involved himself in the search.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You too?

                                     MALKIN
                              (returning her look)
                         Damn right.

               Finding nothing, the group pushes into the metal shop, where 
               Simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an 
               enormous anvil. He lays down his tools and grimly watches 
               the men go through, overturning benches and tables. Tyrian 
               props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to Simon.

                                     TYRIAN
                         As the proud new father of an eligible 
                         daughter who was some-how overlooked 
                         all these years, it may interest you 
                         to know that the King has called for 
                         a new lottery.

                                     SIMON
                         But it's months til the solstice.

                                     TYRIAN
                         In view of what's happened, we all 
                         know what's required.

                                     SIMON
                         I've never taken part in your cursed 
                         lottery, and I'll have nothing to do 
                         with it now.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You were very clever. But she'll 
                         take part, like all the rest. No 
                         exceptions.

               The search party has exhausted the room's hiding places.

                                     HENCHMAN
                         Nothing. If he was here, he's gone 
                         now.

               Tyrian nods and leads the way out. Simon catches up and pulls 
               Tyrian aside at the door.

                                     SIMON
                         All right. I know what you want. How 
                         much?

                                     TYRIAN
                         Are you offering me a bribe?

                                     SIMON
                         Yes.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Don't waste your time.
                              (pause)
                         You could never afford it.

               He spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out of 
               town. Valerian and Simon watch them go. When the riders are 
               out of sight, they return to the shop. With a couple of stout 
               poles, they strain to lift the anvil off its base. Finally 
               it topples over. Valerian slides the base aside, revealing a 
               trap door. She raises it and a cramped Galen unfolds himself 
               from the space below. On his face is a curious look of 
               determination.

                                     GALEN
                         Smith -- have you ever forged a 
                         weapon?

               WEAPONS

               Simon is going through a cabinet, tossing out hoes, rakes, 
               sickles, scythes, plow blades, and a knife or two. Galen 
               examines them doubtfully. Now Simon produces an armload of 
               swords. Galen is impressed; he looks them over carefully, 
               testing and rejecting them in turn.

                                     GALEN
                         These are your sharpest?

               Simon plucks up one of the swords, carries it to the center 
               of the room. He lays a horseshoe on the anvil. He brings the 
               sword down -- whack! -- and cuts the horseshoe in half.

                                     SIMON
                         Even Tyrian carries one of these.

               Galen hefts it dubiously.

                                     GALEN
                         It's sharp -- but it's not sharp 
                         enough.

               Valerian has been watching all this with growing concern.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not sharp enough for what?

                                     GALEN
                         For what I'm going to do with it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Nothing's that sharp.

               Simon gnaws his lip. Reluctantly, he brings a long box from 
               the bottom of the cabinet. He opens it. Lying on a bed of 
               silk is an exquisite two-handed broadsword. The flat blade 
               gleams like a mirror. Galen reaches in and lifts it out.

                                     SIMON
                         The best I ever made.

               Valerian is as awed as Galen.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's beautiful.

               Galen brings up a finger to test the edge. Simon grabs his 
               hand away.

                                     SIMON
                         Don't do that!
                              (he looks at Valerian)
                         Girl-child, when you were born I 
                         knew I had to do something, so I set 
                         about the task of fashioning an 
                         extraordinary weapon: I had the skill 
                         to make it --
                              (bleak pause)
                         -- but not the nerve to use it.

               She looks at him with affection. Leaning forward, she plants 
               a kiss on his bald pate.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm thankful for that.
                              (to Galen)
                         No man should choose a senseless 
                         death.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               Galen, Valerian and Simon tramp through a glade to a mossy 
               bank. There a wide stream flows lazily under a canopy of 
               trees.

                                     VALERIAN
                         If it's me you're worried about, 
                         don't. So my name has been entered, 
                         what of it? There are hundreds of 
                         girls. My name just won't be drawn. 
                         I know it won't.

               Galen walks out into the shallows and pushes the sword-tip 
               into the sandy bottom, angled so that the edge splits the 
               current.

                                     GALEN
                         Valerian, this isn't just for your 
                         sake.

               He walks back to shore. All three watch the sword to see 
               what will happen.

               SWORD

               Big flat oak leaves are gliding along the current. Very 
               slowly, they go by the sword, some of them very close. 
               Finally, one of them floats against the leading edge of the 
               blade and without a ripple is cleft in two. Simon gives Galen 
               a significant look.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I don't care. It doesn't matter. 
                         What you want to kill isn't flesh 
                         and blood.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, it'll bleed, all right.

                                     VALERIAN
                         How do you know? No one's so much as 
                         even scratched it.

               They look to Galen. The apprentice's face is full of doubt.

                                     GALEN
                         I'll need the amulet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KING'S CASTLE - NIGHT

               Carrying torches to light their way, families -- some with 
               maiden daughters -- gather from all over the country in the 
               courtyard of the King's castle. Simon is there with Valerian, 
               and so is Galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide-
               brimmed hat. Like many others, he carries a stick topped 
               with a bleached skull -- to all appearances, just another 
               participant in this weird pagan ritual. A barrel decorated 
               with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front 
               of the main entrance. Horsrik, the King's herald, supervises 
               preparations for the lottery. Armed guards appear carrying a 
               sealed chest. Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour 
               the contents -- hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the 
               name of a potential sacrifice -- into the barrel. Trumpets 
               blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage: 
               the King, his daughter, courtiers and Tyrian. Valerian nudges 
               Galen.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (pointing)
                         Look at her. The Princess.

                                     GALEN
                         I know. We've met.

               Valerian gives Galen a sharp look. Horsrik unrolls a 
               parchment.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (reading)
                         People of Urland: whereas the peace 
                         of the kingdom has been disrupted by 
                         the mischief of an interloper; and 
                         whereas this interloper being fled; 
                         now therefore, his majesty the King 
                         hereby proclaims the sum of thirty 
                         ducats to be paid to anyone producing 
                         the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud 
                         enchanter, to our satisfaction.

               Galen pulls his hat low over his eyes. As the moment for the 
               drawing approaches, Valerian becomes more and more uneasy. 
               She pushes forward through the crowd until she's just below 
               the barrel. She eyes the people around her. Some of them 
               seem equally worried, others -- the better dressed and better 
               fed -- are smug and complacent. The King and his retinue are 
               serene. A chant goes up from the crowd:

                                     CROWD
                         Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!

               Horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved 
               dragon's head and stirs up the names. This done, a new chant 
               goes up:

                                     CROWD
                         Bare the arm! Bare the arm!

               At a signal, a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from 
               Horsrik's right arm. He holds it high. The crowd surges 
               forward. The atmosphere is full of dread and excitement. 
               Valerian looking pale and determined, is jostled and pushed 
               to the edge of the platform.

                                     CROWD
                         Draw the name! Draw the name!

               The moment has come. Down goes Horsrik's arm and up it comes, 
               holding one little wooden square, one young woman's fate. An 
               expectant hush falls over the mob. The virgins of Urland 
               tremble and wait.

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now, my countrymen, hear me: behold, 
                         for I am chosen. I shall die that 
                         many may live. I shall lay down my 
                         life for family and fellows. I shall 
                         go to my grave for the love of our 
                         King and his wise policy. And my 
                         name is --

               He looks down at the tile to read the name, but no sound 
               comes to his lips. He looks back at the crowd, a cold sweat 
               breaking over his face. He swallows, but still can't bring 
               himself to speak. At his feet, Valerian is holding her breath. 
               A new chant goes up.

                                     CROWD
                         The name! The name!

               By now Horsrik is trembling. He stares down at the tile, his 
               mouth set in a grim line. The King is getting annoyed. He 
               gestures and the crowd falls silent.

                                     KING
                         Read the name.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (mastering himself)
                         The name is: Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, 
                         filia regis.

               There is a moment of profound shock. Then a low murmur of 
               wonder moves through the crowd. Galen looks at Valerian; she 
               sags with relief. The King turns to his daughter. She shows 
               nothing. He rises from his chair, comes forward and snatches 
               the tile from Horsrik.

                                     KING
                         That's not the name. It's been 
                         misread.

               Valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy.

                                     VALERIAN
                         There's no mistake! The name's been 
                         chosen -- let it stand!

                                     KING
                         No, the good Horsrik has misspoke 
                         himself.
                              (he looks at the tile)
                         In fairness to this individual, whose 
                         name I can't make out, we'll destroy 
                         this tile.

               He quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow. 
               Led by Valerian, the crowd cries out in protest.

                                     VALERIAN
                         No! What better name than your own 
                         kin? At last we see justice done!

                                     KING
                         Silence! We will have a new choosing. 
                         I will draw the name myself.

               He reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile. He 
               looks at it and his eyes widen. Betrayed, he swivels to face 
               his daughter. The din of the crowd reaches a crescendo.

                                     CROWD
                         Let it stand! Let it stand!

               Elspeth takes the tile from her father's nerveless fingers, 
               looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft.

                                     ELSPETH
                         The name is as you heard it and as 
                         Horsrik read it: Elspeth.

               The King moils through the tiles, finding his daughter's 
               name again and again.

                                     KING
                         The lottery is invalid. Another and 
                         another. What treachery is this?

               Valerian, chanting with the rest, falls silent. She looks at 
               Elspeth with sudden interest and respect, then awe.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Hear me, good people! It is true, 
                         that my name appears on many of the 
                         lots. This does not falsify the 
                         drawing, it certifies it! I have 
                         learned that my name has been kept 
                         from jeopardy in all the drawings in 
                         the past. So I have put my name among 
                         the rest many times -- once for each 
                         risk that, over the years, you took 
                         and I did not.

               The crowd is dumbfounded. Gradually voices erupt in a 
               cacophony of shouts, whistles and excited conversation. Galen 
               sees his chance: there's an unguarded door near the stable. 
               He drifts toward it and slips inside.

               THRONE ROOM

               Galen pokes his head in: the room is empty. He scurries over 
               to a chest, flings it open and starts rummaging. Finding 
               nothing he moves on to a cabinet. He breaks the lock and 
               pries it open. Again, nothing.

               CASTLE CORRIDOR

               Galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down 
               a hall. Suddenly he stops short. There in front of him is a 
               guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. Galen 
               hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves. 
               But the man is only headed for another window and a better 
               view. Galen manages to fall into step an arm's length behind 
               him and slip by without a sound.

               LIBRARY

               Galen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily 
               on the torchlit walls. Hurrying through, his attention is 
               drawn to some open books on a table. Closer inspection reveals 
               magical writings and symbols. Galen paws over everything, 
               suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet. But where 
               is it?

               COURTYARD

               As the crowd disperses Valerian watches Elspeth walk back in 
               the castle, lofty and composed. She looks for Galen and 
               discovers he has gone.

               LIBRARY

               By now, the room is in total disarray. Galen has opened all 
               the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the 
               shelves. No amulet. He's feverishly working on a locked drawer 
               when a voice interrupts him.

                                     KING
                         Don't go to all that trouble.

               Galen whirls around to find the King standing in the doorway. 
               The monarch looks shattered. Galen edges toward the split in 
               the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers. 
               At that moment Tyrian comes through the door, sizes up the 
               situation and draws his sword.

                                     GALEN
                         I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at 
                         least give me a weapon.

                                     TYRIAN
                              (pushing by the King)
                         I think not!

                                     KING
                         Stop! Don't harm him.
                              (to Galen)
                         And you -- don't run away... please...

               The King's voice is cracking. Galen and Tyrian are equally 
               taken aback. The King searches through the books remaining 
               on the library shelves.

                                     KING
                              (shaky)
                         I've always had the greatest 
                         admiration for the black arts. You 
                         chaps with your mysterious spells... 
                         I didn't think it would be necessary, 
                         you see. Vermithrax is an old dragon. 
                         And that, I thought, was the beauty 
                         of my plan -- buying time. We'd wait 
                         her out. I'd live to see the end of 
                         her.
                              (firm)
                         That's still going to happen.

               The King finds the book and takes the amulet out. With 
               trembling hands, he passes it to Galen.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Sire!

                                     KING
                         He shall have it.
                              (pleading)
                         It's my daughter. Save her, I beg 
                         you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE - DAY

               The people of Swanscombe are clearing up the rubble and 
               beginning repairs on their dwellings. Standing in their midst, 
               lecturing every passerby, is Greil. He holds up the charred 
               remains of Brother Jacopus' wooden cross.

                                     GREIL
                         Holy of holies -- he did not die in 
                         vain. Can you hear me, brothers?

               Some workmen go by lugging new thatch. Malkin is with them.

                                     MALKIN
                              (gently)
                         We hear you, Greil.

                                     GREIL
                         Well and good, but I'm Greil no 
                         longer. Call me Gregorius, after the 
                         Bishop of Rome.

               Malkin and the others stop to listen.

                                     GREIL
                         I saw him die. Like Our Lord Jesus 
                         on the cross he was, scourged by 
                         evil. But he showed no fear. Such is 
                         the power of the Holy Ghost.

               BLACKSMITH SHOP

               Galen lurks in the shadows of Simon's metal shop looking out 
               on the square where Greil is holding forth.

                                     GREIL
                         Of what avail is magic? The old gods 
                         died with our daughters. From whence 
                         comest my help? My help comest from 
                         the Lord!

               Galen quietly shuts and bars the door. He moves deeper into 
               the gloomy workroom where Simon is pumping a bellows to heat 
               up the forge. Galen looks at the coals.

                                     SIMON
                         Good and hot.

                                     GALEN
                         Don't bother. That's not the kind of 
                         fire we need.

               Valerian is staring at the sword, sitting on the anvil in 
               its silk wrapping. Galen uncovers it, holds it high, and 
               puts his hand on the amulet.

                                     GALEN
                         Nunc, per Potestatem Hermeticum -- 
                         ex flammis, ferrum sangrinarium!

               The sword starts to hum and to heat up. From the hilt outward 
               the blade glows brighter and brighter: red, orange, white. 
               It lights up the room, throwing long shadows into the corners. 
               Galen lays the white hot steel on the anvil. Simon takes up 
               his hammer and begins the reforging. Valerian sees their 
               resolve. After watching for several moments she slips out 
               the side door, looking sad.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Clouds scud low over the lifeless region. The dragon's lair 
               now has a newer, bigger entrance. Vapors drift upward from 
               it. Down the slope a lonely figure works its way from rock 
               to rock: it's Valerian with a wicker basket on her arm, 
               searching for dragon scales. The basket is already more than 
               half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of 
               the cavern. She's about to turn back when she spies a 
               particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards 
               further on. As she reaches for it, there is a sudden hiss! 
               She jerks her hand back and freezes. There in the shadows is 
               a baby dragon, a basilisk, all coppery bronze with stubby 
               winglets. As she backs away, she sees two more come up to 
               join the first. They watch her retreat through wicked little 
               green eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               On the mossy bank Galen and Simon unwrap the reforged sword. 
               Now the blade carries a faint blue halation. Galen walks to 
               the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip down 
               into the sand. Then he rejoins Simon onshore to await results. 
               This time, as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge, they 
               gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact. Such 
               is the power of the sword that even after many leaves, not a 
               single one has come close enough to be sliced. Simon is agog 
               and even Galen seems satisfied. They clasp hands.

                                     SIMON
                         An edge like no other on this earth.

                                     GALEN
                         Well done, Simon. Thank you.

               Simon hands him a bundle of fighting equipment.

                                     SIMON
                              (grave)
                         I'll say goodbye to Valerian for 
                         you. I'm sorry she's not here, but 
                         you know how she is.

                                     GALEN
                         I understand.

               They look at each other for what could be the last time.

                                     SIMON
                         Fare thee well.

               The old man departs. Galen unfolds the bundle and brings out 
               its contents: mail hauberk with coif, studded leather gloves, 
               padded jerkin, a scabbard and a small wooden shield. He lays 
               them out on the stream bank, then strips off his tunic and 
               kneels down to splash some water in his face. As the cups 
               the water between his hands, an image comes alive and shimmers 
               on the surface: Valerian, stripping off her own clothes, 
               shyly turning toward him, solemn and romantic.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen.

               It's as if the vision is speaking to him, but it's not. He 
               spins around and sees her standing there, fully clothed, and 
               possessed of a brisk and businesslike air.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Here.

               She throws down a shield. It's remarkable in its construction -- 
               overlapping layers of iridescent dragon scales have been 
               ingeniously fastened to a leather-clad frame.

                                     VALERIAN
                         It's a shield. I made it. Might keep 
                         the fire off you. Might not. You 
                         know, you're an idiot. You're going 
                         to die tonight. You'll be ripped 
                         limb from limb. This is the last 
                         time I'll ever speak to you.

               Galen turns the shield over and over, marveling at it. He 
               fixes her with a piercing look.

                                     GALEN
                         Thank you.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (rushing)
                         Another thing. That thing isn't alone 
                         up there. There's little ones. Young, 
                         I think. I don't know how many.

               She shudders. Galen's eyes are still fastened on her. She's 
               fighting to retain her hard manner, but the agitation and 
               dread are plain.

                                     GALEN
                         Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed 
                         too. Anything else?

               Valerian wants to be bold, but on this final point, can't 
               muster the courage.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (tiny voice)
                         You're in love, aren't you?

                                     GALEN
                              (slowly nodding)
                         Yes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         That's all right. I understand. She's 
                         very beautiful, very brave.

                                     GALEN
                         Who is? What do you mean?

                                     VALERIAN
                         Your Princess. But I don't care. It 
                         doesn't change the way I feel.
                              (firm)
                         Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn, 
                         sorcerer's apprentice; you're going 
                         to be dead, the dragon will be worse 
                         than ever, there will be more 
                         lotteries, and I'm not a boy any 
                         more.

                                     GALEN
                         And you'll be eligible because --

                                     VALERIAN
                         Because I'm still a virgin, and I 
                         want you to do something about it.

               Galen takes her in his arms; she is trembling. He tilts her 
               face up toward his and kisses her.

                                     GALEN
                         I am in love. But not with the 
                         Princess.

               Their image is reflected in the waters. Through the ripples 
               she is visible pulling briefly away to remove her clothes.

               From afar, they are two tiny figures under the overarching 
               oaks and willows. They embrace and sink down into the deep 
               grass beside the water. The leaves continue their unhurried 
               course downstream.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT

               A cold wind whistles through the rocks near the dragon's 
               lair. By the light of a flickering torch two workmen finish 
               driving a heavy post into the ground. As they affix a pair 
               of iron manacles they see the torches of a procession coming 
               up the slope. They hurry down to meet it. Horsrik is in the 
               lead, followed by soldiers and royal attendants. Elspeth 
               rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse. Bringing up 
               the rear is Tyrian. At last the cart can go no further. 
               Elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post. 
               As the soldiers put the irons around her wrists, Horsrik 
               unrolls a parchment, turns his back on the wind and begins 
               to read:

                                     HORSRIK
                         Now be it known throughout the 
                         kingdom, that the Princess, having 
                         been chosen by a deed of fortune and 
                         destiny --

               Horsrik blinks. There's a black stain growing in the middle 
               of the parchment; all at once it bursts into flames. He cries 
               out and flings the document away. There follows a flash of 
               light and a puff of smoke and Galen is standing there, as if 
               he had materialized out of thin air. Horsrik and his startled 
               men backpedal down the slope.

                                     HORSRIK
                         No fire, I beg you.

               Galen raises his hands in a menacing gesture.

                                     GALEN
                         Be gone!

               That's enough for Horsrik and company: he and the soldiers 
               depart.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (over his shoulder)
                         I declare these proceedings duly 
                         ordained...

               Only one man remains behind the challenge the young sorcerer: 
               Tyrian. He draws his sword.

                                     TYRIAN
                         I knew I'd find you here. Well, I'm 
                         not as sentimental as some. The 
                         kingdom, every one of us, need this 
                         sacrifice. If you intend to interfere, 
                         you'll have to kill me.

                                     GALEN
                         I've got plenty of reasons to kill 
                         you that have nothing to do with 
                         this sacrifice.

               Galen draws his own sword. As it emerges into the night air 
               it seems imbued with a blue phosphorescence.

                                     TYRIAN
                         Most impressive. Can you use it?

               Elspeth twists around in her chains.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Let it be! Please! Tyrian is right -- 
                         it's our only hope!

               Galen starts to reply, but as soon as his attention wavers, 
               Tyrian is lunging toward him, sword point directed at his 
               neck. Galen barely manages to parry the thrust before Tyrian 
               is at him again, blade swinging toward his knees. Galen drops 
               the tip of his sword to catch the blow. When the two steel 
               edges connect, sparks fly. In a series of thrusts and counter-
               thrusts, each accompanied by a shower of sparks, Tyrian backs 
               Galen up the mountain.

                                     ELSPETH
                         Tyrian -- both of you -- run! Flee! 
                         It's coming!

               Sure enough, at that moment the earth gives out a low moan 
               and undulates in a sickening movement. Vapors begin rising 
               from the lair.

                                     TYRIAN
                         In a trice! This is no swords-man.

               He might be right, for Galen turns and bolts across the slope. 
               When he reaches the post with Tyrian two steps behind, he 
               whirls and brings his blade down on Princess Elspeth's chains. 
               The chains part in an explosion of sparks.

                                     GALEN
                         Run! Get out of here!

               The Princess darts from the piling as Tyrian swoops down to 
               continue the attack. Galen dodges and the stake catches 
               Tyrian's blow. The earth shakes again. Galen glances at the 
               Princess.

                                     GALEN
                         No! Stop! What are you doing?

               Elspeth is not running away down the mountain. Instead she 
               is walking, slowly and deliberately, right into the smoking 
               cave. Swoosh! Tyrian's sword comes down again. The dismayed 
               sorcerer ducks back and Tyrian's blade again bites deep into 
               the wood.

                                     TYRIAN
                         You've failed, my friend, and I thank 
                         the gods for it. Come out from behind 
                         that post.

               It's now or never. Elspeth is no longer in sight. Galen grits 
               his teeth, grasps the sword with two hands and swings it as 
               hard as he can in a wide arc. The blade never even slows 
               down as it sails right through the post, lopping it clean 
               off. The glowing sword flashes above Galen's head and eagerly 
               buries itself in Tyrian's chest. The King's man is as startled 
               by the amputated piling as he is by his own death. His eyes 
               roll up in his head, his knees buckle and he topples backward -- 
               the blade sliding free.

               DRAGON'S LAIR

               Smoke swirls at the mouth of the cave as Galen enters, holding 
               his sword before him, lighting his way with its faint blue 
               glow.

                                     GALEN
                         Elspeth!

               The floor of the cave as it winds down into the mountain is 
               paved first with rock, then with dragon scales, then with 
               bones. With each footfall, clusters of mysterious insects 
               scuttle away. Galen pauses to mop his brow; it's getting 
               hot. A sound echoes up from the depths, a grinding sound 
               like the gnashing of teeth, followed by hissing and squealing. 
               Galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on. Suddenly he 
               stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper: Elspeth's. The 
               grinding sounds are louder. He hurries forward and rounds a 
               corner. He stops and gags.

               BASILISKS

               Two disgusting little reptiles -- like scaly raccoons -- are 
               perched on the corpse of Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, feeding 
               contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh. Galen groans: 
               he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters.

               The other one buzzes its half-formed winglets and hisses a 
               hot stream of air. Galen brings down the sword and slices it 
               in half. Eyes riveted on Elspeth's remains, he edges around 
               the carnage and backs away. Hissss! -- there's a third one, 
               lurking in the shadows, munching on something; it might be a 
               hand. Galen shrieks and jumps away. The little creature comes 
               at him and clamps its jaws on his leg. Galen stabs at it 
               repeatedly. Finally it lets go, and flails and flops across 
               the bloody floor, ululating its death agony. As the creature's 
               last mewlings echo down through the cavern, the ground 
               quivers. Bits of stone fall from the ceiling.

               LAKE OF FIRE

               Galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are 
               alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water. As before, 
               he holds the sword in front of him; he marvels at its 
               increasing brightness. The heat is increasing too; sweat 
               mats his hair and runs down his face. A few yards further on 
               the sword starts pulsating. Now the walls take on a flickering 
               rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista 
               of staggering immensity: an underground lake, its surface 
               bubbling and torn with sheets of flame. Arching over it is a 
               vault of stone, penetrated here and there by natural chimneys. 
               The dimensions of this internal world are unknown -- the 
               fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers. The 
               one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones 
               leading across the hot liquid. Galen grips his sword and 
               resolutely hops from rock to rock.

               VERMITHRAX

               He's halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping 
               stones teeter beneath his feet. A fiery wave washes over his 
               legs, leaving his boots smoking. Another tremor knocks Galen 
               to his knees. As he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield, 
               the great head of Vermithrax rises up out of the depths on 
               its long neck. It gazes at him through huge pale eyes under 
               armored lids. A tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless 
               mouth. The head sways from side to side. The mouth hinges 
               open, the nostril-like igniters come on and touch off the 
               jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards. A roaring tube of 
               flame engulfs Galen. He crouches behind his dragon scale 
               shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life. 
               The dragon pauses to take a breath. Galen springs to his 
               feet, and bounds back the way he came, his skin and clothing 
               singed. Flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with 
               a second burst.

               TUNNEL

               Coughing and weeping, Galen staggers up through the tunnel, 
               nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons. A 
               few seconds later, Vermithrax follows, squirming and clawing 
               its way upward. When it reaches its dead offspring it surveys 
               the scene with expressionless eyes. Bringing its head low, 
               it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones.

               AMBUSH

               At that moment Galen leaps out from behind a niche in the 
               tunnel wall and lunges forward. Striking sparks, the point 
               of his sword slides across the dragon's plated cheek and 
               stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck. There is an 
               unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and 
               upward. Galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half 
               a sword. The rest is buried in the beast's neck, and 
               Vermithrax doesn't like it. It flings its head this way and 
               that, knocking rocks loose from the ceiling. Its movements 
               cause the ground to quake. As boulders tumble around him, 
               Galen drops to the floor under his shield. Dragon flame 
               reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DAWN

               Valerian roams the rock-strewn slope not far from the dragon's 
               lair. Presently she comes upon a once-familiar object -- the 
               fire shield. Half the scales are gone, the rest are charred 
               and curling. Grimly, she moves on. A few paces away she picks 
               up the blunted sword. She scans the rocks and finally sees 
               what she's looking for.

               GALEN

               He's lying face down behind a boulder, his clothes charred, 
               patches of skin scorched. He looks dead. Valerian rolls him 
               onto his back. She gasps: the eyes are open, regarding her.

                                     GALEN
                         Still alive.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               Simon is standing by the anvil with the broken sword in his 
               hand, lost in thought.

               HOUSE

               In the adjoining house Valerian tends Galen's wounds. He's 
               propped up on a palette enduring the application of poultices.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You know what we have to do.
                              (he looks at her with 
                              dull eyes)
                         We have to leave Urland.

               He winces in pain.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not because of what happened. I 
                         brought you here -- it didn't work -- 
                         now I'm taking you away. Do you 
                         understand?
                              (Galen does not react)
                         You said you loved me. Is it true? 
                         If it is, it's the only good we've 
                         done. Let's not lose that too.
                              (pause)
                         Galen?

               He seems miles away. She turns aside, on the verge of tears. 
               Simon is standing there, still holding the sword hilt.

                                     SIMON
                         She's right. What kind of a life 
                         could you have here? It's too late 
                         for me, but you're young enough.
                              (he shows them the 
                              sword)
                         You know what I think? Magic is dying 
                         out, fading from the world. But that 
                         makes me happy. That means the dragon 
                         will be dying too.

               Galen looks at him; he has heard everything. He sits up and 
               fondly regards Valerian.

               PACKING

               Valerian packs her belongings into a rucksack. The last item 
               in is her blue frock, carefully rolled. Beside her, Galen 
               dons clean traveling clothes. He stiffly crosses the room 
               and drags his pack out of the corner. He sorts through the 
               effects, and amidst the clothing and supplies discovers the 
               leather pouch containing Ulrich's remains. He contemplates 
               it.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's that?

                                     GALEN
                         Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor 
                         Hodge.

               He tucks the pouch away, throws some clothes on top and ties 
               the satchel shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STREAM - DAY

               Beside the quiet stream Simon bids farewell to the young 
               couple, embracing each in turn. They slosh across the shallow 
               water and follow a path into the woods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

               Greil is standing outside the half-burned grange hall, 
               summoning the Christian faithful. He proclaims the call to 
               worship by hammering on a small bell. One by one the townsfolk 
               arrive. Among them is Simon, looking bereft.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FOREST PATH - DAY

               Valerian and Galen trudge along side by side.

                                     VALERIAN
                         How's your leg?

                                     GALEN
                         Hurts. That thing was small, but its 
                         teeth were sharp.

                                     VALERIAN
                         At least you killed it. You got all 
                         the young.

               This is small consolation, and Galen sighs.

                                     GALEN
                         But the big one's alive. Somewhere 
                         down in that burning lake.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Don't think about it. You had your 
                         fight, and you're still here. That's 
                         more than anyone else can say. Let's 
                         think about what lies ahead.

               She reaches out to take his hand. But Galen is no longer at 
               her side. She stops and looks back.

               GALEN

               Galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path. He's 
               staring into the middle distance with a sudden inspiration 
               bubbling in his brain. He flings off his sack, drops to his 
               knees and tears through the contents. Valerian comes back, 
               baffled. Galen's gear is strewn all over the trail.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What are you doing?

               Galen comes up with what he's looking for -- the leather 
               sack. When he replies, it is not to her, but to Ulrich:

                                     GALEN
                         You old trickster! The burning water! 
                         The lake of fire!

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen, what are you saying?

               He regards her with astonishment.

                                     GALEN
                         He had it planned. He knew this was 
                         going to happen.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Who did? What happened?

                                     GALEN
                         We've got to go back, I want to talk 
                         to him!

               He heads back down the trail, leaving his belongings on the 
               road.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Where are you going?

               She hurries after him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               Greil, a.k.a. Gregorious, stands in the center of the burned-
               out granary, delivering a sermon. Behind him, men are filling 
               the baptismal cistern.

                                     GREIL
                         The Church is mother to us all. Not 
                         just one lonely orphan who has lost 
                         his way, not just a few, but all of 
                         us that believeth in Him. When enough 
                         voices come together in prayer, He 
                         shall hear, we shall live and the 
                         beast shall die.

               In the gathering Simon ponders the hilt of his once fabulous 
               sword. With its blade shortened, it looks a lot like a 
               crucifix.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

               Galen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage, 
               trailed by a desperate Valerian.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen, stop! Please, I beg you!

               But Galen pays no attention. In a burst of speed and fury, 
               Valerian comes up behind and tackles him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Stop! I won't let you kill yourself.

               Galen waves the leather pouch in Valerian's face.

                                     GALEN
                         He couldn't walk -- he knew he 
                         couldn't make the journey. So he had 
                         us make the journey for him! Don't 
                         you see?

               He jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair.

                                     VALERIAN
                              (pursuing)
                         No!

               She tackles him again.

                                     VALERIAN
                         All right, all right. You're going 
                         in there, I'm going too.

                                     GALEN
                              (brought up short)
                         What? Why? No you're not, this is my 
                         job. Absolutely not.

               But Valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair.

                                     VALERIAN
                         I'm not afraid. And you're not going 
                         to stop me. After all -- I've been a 
                         man longer than you have.

               Galen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near 
               the remains of the wooden stake, then charges after her.

               UNDERGROUND

               Running footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and Galen 
               comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the 
               way. Valerian stumbles after him. He grabs her hand.

                                     GALEN
                         Stay close.

               Down and down they go. Soon they reach Elspeth's body.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What's that?

                                     GALEN
                         Never mind. Come on.

               But she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see.

                                     GALEN
                         All right. Wait here.

               He darts off. In the flickering torchlight Valerian can see 
               the Princess' remains all too clearly. She suppresses a 
               scream.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen? Galen? Where are you?

               No answer. The torch reveals several passages. She doesn't 
               know which one to take.

               LAKE OF FIRE

               The passage widens out and once again Galen is standing on 
               the shores of the lake of fire. He looks around. The water 
               is rolling with bubbles of gas, and flames run hither and 
               yon across the surface, but there is no sign of the dragon. 
               Gathering his courage, he hops across the stepping stones to 
               the middle of the lake. There he hurriedly opens the pouch.

                                     GALEN
                         Ex favilla, vita nova!

               Gripping the amulet with his free hand, he scatters Ulrich's 
               ashes in a wide arc over the burning water. Instantly, there 
               is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug. But no 
               wizard appears. No dragon, either. There follows another and 
               stronger quake. Galen crouches to keep his balance. Still no 
               wizard.

               OUTSIDE

               Thoroughly bewildered, Valerian stumbles out into daylight. 
               She wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against 
               the stake. Something is strange: it's getting dark. Squinting 
               up at the sun, she frowns in puzzlement, then gapes at what 
               is happening.

               ECLIPSE

               Slowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides 
               over the face of the sun, plunging the world into crepuscular 
               half-light.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               The congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden 
               darkness.

                                     GREIL
                         Be calm. He watcheth over us! And 
                         this is His sign! Let us pray! Our 
                         Father who art in heaven...

               The faithful bow their heads and join in. Simon as well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LAKE OF FIRE

               The earthquakes have subsided; the water is calm. Galen stares 
               bleakly into the flames. As he watches, they gather themselves 
               into a lazy spiral. Gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes 
               a vortex. Now the flames become tinged with green, and as 
               the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air, a form takes 
               shape at the crest of a jet of flame. It is Ulrich, supine 
               as upon his pyre, reforming before Galen's eyes.

                                     GALEN
                         Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can 
                         see you! Over here!

                                     ULRICH
                              (looks at him)
                         Not so loud. I'm not deaf, you know.

               He slowly raises himself into an upright posture and strides 
               through the flames.

                                     ULRICH
                         Sic redit magus ex terra mortis.

               The apprentice throws himself at his master's feet.

                                     GALEN
                         Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I 
                         thank the powers that made me!

                                     ULRICH
                         Glad to see you, too. You didn't 
                         bring along anything to eat, by any 
                         chance?

                                     GALEN
                         Food?

                                     ULRICH
                         No? Oh well, no time anyway.

               OUTSIDE

               Valerian is standing in the unearthly twilight, anxiously 
               peering into the mouth of the lair. Suddenly she is hit from 
               behind by a gust of wind. She does not turn to see the 
               enormous Vermithrax alighting silently behind her.

               GALEN & ULRICH

               Ulrich raises Galen to his feet.

                                     ULRICH
                         Come along. There's much to be done.

                                     GALEN
                         Wait, I have something to tell you.

                                     ULRICH
                         It can wait.

                                     GALEN
                         No it can't. Listen: I thought I was 
                         a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought 
                         I had power -- but I didn't. I thought 
                         I was you -- but I'm not.

               He hangs his head. Ulrich regards him steadily.

                                     ULRICH
                         Well said. Now hurry.

               He leads the way across the rocks to the shore and into the 
               tunnel.

               VALERIAN

               Time seems to have come to a stop. Overhead, the moon is 
               locked in front of the sun. At the lair, Valerian stands 
               frozen as the dragon leans over her. The great head sways 
               from side to side. The jaws hinge open. Suddenly, Valerian 
               recovers herself and makes a run for it, leaping and 
               scrabbling over the rocks. A plume of flame licks at her 
               heels. She sees a protective crevice and heads for it, but a 
               winged claw drops to block her way. She changes direction 
               and is cut off again. Cat and mouse.

               VERMITHRAX

               The pale yellow eyes stare implacably down at the hopeless 
               victim. The igniter jets come on, then off, as the beast 
               suddenly stiffens. The head rotates, almost as if catching a 
               new scent. Finally the eyes focus on the entrance to the 
               cavern.

               ULRICH

               There is the sorcerer, leaning on Galen, coolly regarding 
               the creature. The old man's expression hardens.

                                     ULRICH
                         Draco draconis...

               The dragon lifts its wings as if to menace them, then flaps 
               twice and is airborne. The thing shoots overhead and, with a 
               rush of wind, flies off into the gloom.

               IN THE ROCKS

               Valerian struggles out of her hiding place.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Galen!

               Galen runs to her. They embrace. When they look up, Ulrich 
               is at their side.

                                     ULRICH
                         Where's my amulet? Give it to me, 
                         please.

               Galen's hand locates the jewel under his shirt. He finds 
               himself reluctant to part with it.

               With a hurricane howl, a column of flame touches down nearby 
               and rushes toward them. They stagger back as the dragon sweeps 
               past.

                                     ULRICH
                         Be quick!

               Galen hands his treasure over. Ulrich closes his hand around 
               it.

                                     ULRICH
                         Come close to me.

               Galen and Valerian approach. The old man's hand is suffused 
               with an internal glow. Behind them, the dragon is turning 
               for another pass.

               VORTEX

               All at once the glow brightens, and in another instant the 
               world spins off into a blur, setting all three afloat in a 
               timeless netherworld. Valerian and Galen cling to each other 
               in terror.

                                     ULRICH
                         Don't be afraid. You have served me 
                         with great courage. Now you must 
                         show me you have even more.

                                     GALEN
                         Anything!

               The voices seem to be coming from a huge distance. Starlike 
               gleams whiz by, and fleeting glimpses of half-recognizable 
               faces and forms. The wizard's eyes are like glittering 
               crystals. Tiny motes and planetoids dance in the hairs of 
               his beard. He seems wreathed in luminescence.

                                     ULRICH
                         You must destroy the amulet, and me 
                         along with it.

                                     GALEN
                         No!

                                     ULRICH
                         You brought me from the flames, you 
                         must send me back.

                                     GALEN
                         I can't.

                                     ULRICH
                         When the time comes, you'll 
                         understand. Here.

               He dangles the amulet in front of Galen. Even more reluctantly 
               than he let it go, he takes it back.

               MOUNTAIN TOP

               Abruptly, the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a 
               rocky crag overlooking the eclipse-darkened fields and farms 
               of Urland. Galen glances at his surroundings and stares at 
               the amulet, full of awe.

                                     ULRICH
                         I know what you're thinking. You 
                         have learned much and done well. 
                         Don't worry, you won't need it any 
                         more.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRANGE HALL - DAY

               Greil is urging Simon, the last of the converts, into the 
               cistern.

                                     GREIL
                         Make haste, brother.

               He dips Simon's head under water.

                                     GREIL
                         Now be thou baptized in the name of 
                         the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. May 
                         the Lord our God light our way.

               In the background, half the congregation is staring through 
               the burned-out walls, fervently praying and crossing 
               themselves, wondering if they'll ever see the sun again. A 
               cry goes up: a shape crosses the solar corona, wheels over 
               the village and streaks away toward the mountains -- the 
               dragon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOUNTAIN TOP

               Galen and Valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch 
               Ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff. The 
               old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back.

                                     ULRICH
                         Nimbus! Tempestas! Fulmen!

               From over the horizon roiling inky-black clouds churn down 
               upon them. Thunder booms and echoes. A bitter wind whips 
               their clothing. As the storm gathers fury, the dragon 
               reappears, circling in the distance. Finally it homes in on 
               the mountain crag and dives at Ulrich. The conjurer makes a 
               gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beast's 
               scaly flanks. It emits a high thin scream and rockets past.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               Valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of 
               granite.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Here. Do as he said. Smash it.

                                     GALEN
                         Not if it means killing him.

               ULRICH

               He resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds 
               and starts another pass. Again, the sorcerer summons lightning 
               bolts. But the dragon keeps coming; this time a talon splits 
               the old man's cape.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               Valerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to 
               the ground.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You heard what he said.

               She lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it.

                                     GALEN
                         No! You can't!

               THE LAST ATTACK

               Vermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. 
               Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds 
               his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the 
               creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the 
               master magician away in its huge hind claw.

                                     ULRICH
                         Galen!

               Galen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling 
               upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As 
               the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear 
               Ulrich's faint screams.

               DEATH

               Now Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from 
               Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He 
               takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then 
               brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding 
               flash as it shatters into a million fragments.

               Far above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly 
               body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened 
               sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the 
               dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian 
               torch plummets to the ground.

               LAKE

               Below, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing 
               a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the 
               water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam.

               GALEN & VALERIAN

               They stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further 
               explosions boil the water from the pond.

               ECLIPSE

               Behind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a 
               pale sun.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               THE CARCASS - DAY

               Grey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen 
               and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened 
               wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to 
               the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside 
               down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise. 
               The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward 
               them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of 
               Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the 
               hulk. The song ends.

                                     GREIL
                         Let us pray.

               The members of the congregation fall to their knees.

                                     GREIL
                         We thank thee, Lord, for this divine 
                         deliverance. Verily is thy presence 
                         amongst us, fully manifest in this, 
                         thy great work.

               Galen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand.

                                     GREIL
                         Arise, children of the Lord and 
                         forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. 
                         Rejoice in the true power of the 
                         Christian God!

               Galen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the 
               mist.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               FLENSING - DAY

               In the clear light of a new day, ladders have been tipped up 
               against the creature's back. Teams of men swarm over the 
               crusted flesh, slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial. 
               Below, yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges. In 
               the background other workmen dump the remains into an open 
               pit.

               THE KING

               With the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal 
               coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. A door creaks open 
               and King Casiodorus totters out. His face is puffy, his eyes 
               are red. He slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon 
               and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. Horsrik 
               steps out of the coach and draws himself up.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (loud)
                         All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon 
                         slayer!

               The workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement 
               and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. Wordlessly they 
               resume their labors.

                                     HORSRIK
                              (nodding)
                         Hail and praise be!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               ON THE ROAD - DAY

               The trail leads through copses and open meadows. Side by 
               side, Galen and Valerian march up a long slope under a hot 
               sun. He limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You want to rest?

                                     GALEN
                         No. I'm fine.

                                     VALERIAN
                         You miss Ulricn.

                                     GALEN
                         Yes.

                                     VALERIAN
                         And the amulet.

                                     GALEN
                         That too.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad 
                         you did what you did.
                              (he doesn't reply)
                         You may not be a sorcerer, Galen, 
                         but I love you anyway. I don't regret 
                         anything that happened. I just wish --

                                     GALEN
                         Yes?

                                     VALERIAN
                              (sighs)
                         -- that we had a horse.

               Galen falls a step behind. He briefly closes his eyes and 
               mutters something. They walk on a few paces. Then there is a 
               whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters 
               forth. It crosses a meadow, comes right up to Valerian and 
               nuzzles her.

                                     VALERIAN
                         What is this?

                                     GALEN
                         A horse.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Did you...!?

                                     GALEN
                         No. It must have been wandering loose. 
                         Or wild.

               Galen climbs aboard. He reaches out to help her up.

                                     VALERIAN
                         Wait a minute. I just wished for a 
                         horse and here it is.

                                     GALEN
                         You don't want to wish it gone, do 
                         you?

               She thinks for a moment, then lets him help her up. Galen 
               touches the horse's flanks with his heels and they ride off.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

          1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1
                         
           We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.
                         
           DRIVER O/S
           ...hundred thousand streets in this city,
           you don't need to know the route. You give
           me a time and place, I give you a five
           minute window. Those five minutes I'm
           yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute
           either side you're on your own...
                         
           As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2
                         
           A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -
                         
           DRIVER O/S
           ...One last thing. You won't be able to
           reach me at this number again...
                         
           DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.
                         
          3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3
                         
           Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
           bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle
                         
          4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4
                         
           The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
           carefully, letting other cars overtake.
                         
          5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5
                         
           Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment
           block.

          6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6
                         
           Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
           elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.
                         
          7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7
                         
           Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.
                         
          8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8
                         
           Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
           vintage cars.
                         
          9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9
                         
           SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
           follows him past rows of vintage cars.
                         
                          SHANNON
           ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but
           with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
           You get any sleep?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not this week.
                         
           As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I can offer you some Halcyon.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Won't work.
                         
           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
           arrive at a plain looking Impala.
                         
                          SHANNON
           There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular
           car in the state of California...
                         
           Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds
           out his hand for the keys.

          10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10
                         
           The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
                         
          11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11
                         
           A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
           Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
           buried!...
                         
           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
           commentary now.
                         
                          POLICE SCANNER
           ...9 Adam 81, what is your current
           location?...Repeat, what is your current
           location?...
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...Another unbelievable three pointer from
           Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
                         
           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...Time out Knicks...
                         
           The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
                         
           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.

                         11 CONTINUED: 11
                         
           The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
           what's happened to his partner.
                         
           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
                         
           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.
                         
          12 INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 12
                         
           Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as

           Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.
           River again, heading back in the same direction he came.

           Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
           sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
           switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.

           The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
           probing to see if there's anyone out there.

           The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car
           glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.

           It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
           same direction as the black-and-white.
                         
          14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14
                         
           It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY

           Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to

           Centre...
                         
           Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
           swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
                         
           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
           just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
           closer and closer.
                         
           Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
           chopper's searchlights spot them.
                         
          15 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.15
                         
           The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
           crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
           can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
           the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.
                         
          16 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 16
                         
           Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
           Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
           factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
           The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
           basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
           sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.

           The armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more
           respect now.
                         
          17 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 17
                         
           There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
           behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
           still playing.

           The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
           trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
           approaching in the opposite direction.

           The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
           Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
           turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.

           In the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the
           police dispatch to respond.

           As soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next
           street.

           Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the
           opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
           the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.

           Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
           smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
           glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
           overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
           its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
                         
           Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
           of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
           him as he guns down Figueroa.

           The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the
           barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
           ticket and roars into the parking lot.

           The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game
           going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
           into a free parking space.

           are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game
           is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic.

           The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening
           anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
           the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.

           Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They
           climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches
           them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
           Impala himself and heads towards another car.

           Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping
           anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights
           into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers
           sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making
           his getaway.

           Driver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we
           PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's
           uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several
           other `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs,
           reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP
           GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.
                         
           Driver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN
           being fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical
           to the STAR of the movie who stands nearby.

           main road.
                         
           In his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on
           cue, bearing down on him.

           Driver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black
           Charger keeps coming at speed.
                         
           Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the
           other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.
                         
           The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles
           an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
                         
           Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as
           his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the
           car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips
           end over end.
                         
           Up ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop.
                         
           2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
           ...And CUT!...
                         
           Some clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew
           couldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot
           lists. Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and
           helping him out of his battered Black-and-White.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Nice work, officer...
                         
           Driver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered
           windscreen.
                         
          27 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - DAY. 27
                         
           A New York style pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. A WAITER takes a
           delivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a
           table where Shannon is sitting with an old friend, BERNIE ROSE.
                         
                          WAITER
           Here you go, Mr. Rose.
           (Taking out the white boxes)
           Egg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor
           shrimp and Peking duck.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Did they remember the chop sticks?
                         
                          WAITER
           Doesn't look like it, sir. Let me run and
           get the guy.
                         
           From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's
           power and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their
           conversation.

           ...You run a perfectly good business. Why
           would you want to change now?
                         
                          SHANNON
           You know how much my business made last
           year? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to
           build a car and a couple of seconds for
           these jerks to write it off on a stunt that
           doesn't even make it into the movie.
                         
           Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           How much do you need?
                         
                          SHANNON
           Let me talk you through it first.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           That sounds like a lot.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Doesn't have to be. The big money teams
           burn through three, four million a year but
           that's `cause they're using half a dozen
           test drivers and a stable of cars.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I don't know anything about car racing but
           I assume there's a reason for that?
                         
                          SHANNON
           Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need
           is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
           the small-town action then work our way up.
           There's close to two thousand events out
           there and once we make the Show we're
           talking millions.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           `Millions'?
                         
                          SHANNON
           There's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship.
           TV deals. We'll even name the team after
           you.
                         
           Bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away
           as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Thank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any
           of this?

           Bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You still haven't given me a number?
                         
           Shannon hesitates but only for a second.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Four hundred and thirty thousand dollars.
                         
           Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Look, I wouldn't come to you unless I was
           sure about this.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What
           have you got these big money teams don't
           have?

           I got a driver.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           And they got half a dozen Drivers you told
           me.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Not like this one.
                         
           He stares at his friend with quiet conviction.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I been working with this guy a long time -
           I've never seen anything like it. I had the
           money I'd back him myself...
                         
           Bernie Rose considers him quietly.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           But you don't have the money.

           Everything I own is in metal. I had to sell
           my Bullit car the other day just to pay the
           gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this

           Shannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull
           of a man with a gruff voice.

           Shannon smiles, intimidated by Nino, giving up his seat
           respectfully. Nino doesn't even acknowledge him.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Take a hike. I need to talk to my partner.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Driver stands in the elevator as it climbs slowly. It reaches
           the ground floor then the doors slide open. Driver finds himself
           face to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night. She

           stares out quietly. Irene takes a glance at him, feeling awkward
           in the silence. She looks relieved as the elevator doors finally
           open. Driver steps aside to let her out first.

           only a few feet apart. She seems more aware of his presence than
           he is of hers. She reaches the door to her apartment first.

           Bright sunlight. In the distance we see a trail of dust moving
           across the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum
           of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It
           shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting
           louder as it picks up speed.
                         
           Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the
           makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful

           Even in the cramped space of the roll cage there's something
           effortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are
           fixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he
           lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.

           The glinting vehicle is lost in a cloud of dust, then reappears
           again, moving even faster now. The STOCK CAR'S OWNER, a bearded
           hot-rodder with a t-shirt that says, "Drive it like you stole
           it", joins Shannon with a confident smile.

           Maybe where you come from...
                         
           Bernie Rose pays no attention to their banter, his eyes fixed
           thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop.
                         
          33 EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 33
                         
           Driver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon
           limping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS,
           and Bernie Rose.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Looks a little long in the tooth to me.
           Think we should take her home?...
                         
           Driver shrugs. Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Bernie, this is the driver I been telling
           you about...
                         
           One look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and
           authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Bernie's thinking of investing in our race
           team...
                         
           The old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze.
                         
                          DRIVER
           My hands are a little dirty.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Don't worry. So are mine...

           He gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up.
           Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's
           owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch.
                         
           STOCK CAR OWNER
           Couldn't see much wrong with that. You beat
           the fastest lap by more than half a second.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You might wanna take a look at the
           suspension before we go again.
           (Turning back to Bernie)
           Nice to meet you...
                         
           Bernie's still studying him.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You too...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car
           owner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares
           after him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's
           getting interested.
                         
                          SHANNON
           You gonna give me the four?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I'll give you three for seventy percent...
                         
          34 INT. SUPERMARKET/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 34
                         
           Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks
           past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the
           choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his
           eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is
           browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her
           is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack
           of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly
           picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single
           snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy
           turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle
           before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.
                         
          35 EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY. 35
                         
           Driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of
           groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park.
           Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine.
           She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening
           the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix.
           Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful.

           Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to
           his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing
           frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.
                         
           Irene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then
           smiling. We watch from a distance as they talk now.
                         
          35a INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 35a
                         
           Driver, Irene and Benicio stand in silence in the elevator,
           Driver clutching some of Irene's grocery bags.
                         
          36 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 36
                         
           Driver carries Irene's grocery bags into the kitchen for her.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Where do you want me to put them?
                         
                          IRENE
           Just over there. Thanks...
                         
           Driver places the bags on the kitchen counter.
                         
                          IRENE
           Would you like something to drink?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm okay.
                         
                          IRENE
           A glass of water?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Sure...
                         
           She pours him a glass of water and hands it to him.
                         
                          IRENE
           Excuse me a second...
                         
           She walks out of the room, leaving Driver alone with Benicio.
           The little boy stares at him fixedly.
                         
          36a INT. BATHROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 36a
                         
           Irene closes the bathroom door behind her, looking at herself in
           the mirror, feeling a little uncertain.

           Benicio's still staring at Driver. Feeling a little awkward,
           Driver takes a long piece of string from his pocket, tugs it
           gently, then holds up two pieces of string.

           Benicio keeps staring at him, puzzled by the magic trick. Irene
           walks back into the room, smiling.
                         
                          IRENE
           You just move to LA?
                         
                          DRIVER
           No, I been here a while.
                         
                          IRENE
           And before that?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Here and there...
                         
                          IRENE
           (A gentle smile)
           Too many questions, huh?...
                         
           Driver smiles back awkwardly, not sure how else to respond.
           Irene switches on the TV for Benicio, sitting him down on the
           couch.
                         
           Driver has a sip of water, glancing around the room. He notices
           a few photographs on a side table. Most of them are of Benicio
           and Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to
           a strikingly handsome Latino man.
                         
           Irene turns around and sees him looking at the picture.
                         
                          IRENE
           That's Benicio's father.
                         
           Driver takes in the significance of this, then looks back at
           her.
                         
                          DRIVER

           He's in jail.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm sorry.

           Isn't that dangerous?

           Passing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio
           are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look
           like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a
           basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball.
                         
           Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing

           The reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's
           windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off
           from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS
           and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above
           airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.

           It's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable
           to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit
           mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out
           with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly.
           Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the
           longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a
           weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in
           his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.

           Driver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard
           and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat
           opposite him.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           You're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last
           year. You drove me and my brother back from
           Palm Springs...

           Driver stares into the redneck's coked-up eyes, then looks back
           down at his food.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           Next run we hired another wheelman - I
           spent six months in jail, my brother got
           himself killed...
           (He grins through yellowing teeth)
           He wasn't much, mind you, just family...
                         
           Driver doesn't seem to hear him.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           Thing is -
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm not interested...
                         
           Driver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The
           Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a
           moment, then decides against it, standing up.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           Well, it's good to see you again...
                         
           Driver carries on eating as if the man didn't exist.
                         
          42 EXT. FORECOURT/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 42
                         
           The loud stutter of an unhealthy engine. Shannon sits in the
           second hand race car he bought in Montecito, revving the engine.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Sounds like a goddamn M-16...
                         
           Driver smiles, popping the hood. As Shannon limps out of the
           vehicle he sees a battered Oldsmobile drive into the forecourt.
           He takes one look at the owner, then runs his hand through his
           white hair, breaking into a friendly smile.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Gorgeous day just got even nicer. How can I
           help you, ma'am?

           I can imagine. That thing must be older
           than I am...
                         
           Driver turns around in surprise now, recognizing Irene's voice.

           Hi...
                         
           A mischievous smile lights up Shannon's face as he watches them.
                         
                          SHANNON

           Driver ignores the sly look in the old man's eyes.
                         
                          SHANNON
           So what seems to be the problem, ma'am?
                         
                          IRENE
           Either it doesn't start or it stalls.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Well, why don't we park her over there and
           take a look...
                         
           Driver is still watching Irene quietly.
                         
                          IRENE
           I can come back later if you're busy...

           He's busy, I'm not...
                         
           Shannon gives Driver another sly look as he takes her car keys.

           The Oldsmobile's engine looks like it hasn't been serviced in
           years. Shannon is bent over the hood.
                         
                          SHANNON
           ...Just my opinion, but I think you should
           consider buying a new car...

           That would be great...
                         
           She glances round and sees Benicio standing in the forecourt
           with Driver, watching him work on his own car now.

           Driver's so busy tuning the engine he hardly notices the boy.
           His lack of interest finally gets a rise out of Benicio.
                         
                          BENICIO
           That thing doesn't work.

           Benicio watches him sullenly, more intrigued than he lets on.
                         
                          BENICIO
           Drive it.

           Okay. Get in the car...
                         
           Benicio considers a moment, then turns and calls out to Irene.
                         
                          BENICIO
           Mama, can I go in the car?!

           We been together about five years now. He
           showed up out of the blue one day, no

           I offered him half the wages I normally pay
           and he didn't even blink. Been exploiting

           The car roars along the drainage canals. In the passenger seat
           Benicio looks tense but exhilarated. The car glides past a
           landscape of abandoned shopping carts, garbage bags, and
           shredded tires, picking up speed all the time.

           Driver's parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal
           which looks like an oasis. He leans against the vehicle, soft
           rock playing on his radio as he watches Benicio climb a tree.

           Benicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now. Driver's
           giving him and Irene a ride back to their apartment. Irene looks
           at Driver, waiting for him to say something, but he keeps his
           eyes fixed on the road.

           on his bed. Irene takes off her son's clothes and puts on his
           pyjamas, careful not to wake him. Driver slips out of the room,
           uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son.

           Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver
           finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the
           door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver
           knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds
           him back. Instead he just offers his help.

           Benicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits
           beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax.

           Irene emerges with Benicio from the dentists. The little boy is
           clutching his mouth, making a show of being in pain. Irene
           teases him gently as they walk. Driver waits for them in his
           car, watching them quietly.

           Soft rock plays on the car radio. Irene sits in the passenger
           seat with a smile. Driver looks at her curiously as he drives,
           no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and
           changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring
           out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back.
           Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.

           garage -- fixing cars, taking out some fruit he's left to ripen
           in his tool box for lunch, working on more engines and frames.
           At the end of the day Driver and Shannon examine the stock car.

           Thursday or Friday.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I can't make Friday.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Yeah? Why's that?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I told Irene I'd drive her to Burbank.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Irene, huh?

           You're seeing quite a lot of the young
           lady.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You're taking a long time to fix her car...

           On the TV, a Japanese cartoon is playing, a masked hero
           confronting the villains, the screen flickering from color to
           black and white. Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching
           the cartoon. From their relaxed body language it's clear some
           time has passed and they know each other a little better.
                         
                          DRIVER
           What's happening now?
                         
                          BENICIO
           He's telling him if he doesn't leave the
           earth alone he'll fight him.
                         
           Irene calls out from her bedroom.
                         
           IRENE O/S
           I'm almost ready...
                         
           Driver looks back at the screen. Werewolves appear now,
           surrounding the hero.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Looks like he's in trouble.
                         
                          BENICIO
           He's okay.
                         
           Just as the fight begins the color on the TV screen flickers.

           I'm gonna show you another trick...
                         
           Benicio watches curiously as Driver gets off the couch and
           kneels beside the TV.
                         
                          DRIVER
           This is pretty complicated. You watching?
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and
           the interference stops.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Think you can remember that?...
                         
           Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears
           the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her
           waitress's uniform, and answers it.
                         
                          IRENE
           Hello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...
                         
           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.
                         
           YOUNG WOMAN (IRENE'S FRIEND)
           Hi...

           Hi Cindy...
                         
           Irene's friend heads past Driver and scolds Benicio
           affectionately.
                         
                          IRENE'S FRIEND

           It's not the TV. It's a DVD...
                         
           Driver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing
           a smile but still looking distracted.

           The park looks pretty at night...
                         
           She looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away
           again.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You okay?...
                         
           Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the
           window.
                         
                          IRENE
           That was my husband's lawyer on the phone.
           He's getting an early release...
                         
           She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even
           though it hits him like a sledgehammer.
                         
                          DRIVER
           That's great...
                         
                          IRENE
           I'm happy for Benicio...
                         
           Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say
           anything, driving in silence.
                         
           Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a
           stop.
                         
           Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at
           Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light,
           something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.
                         
           She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the
           back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
                         
           The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
           out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her
           hand, as if nothing's happened.
                         
           Outside the lights change to green.

           Irene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his
           FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his
           arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests.
                         
                          STANDARD
           ...I'm touched and grateful that you're all
           here today -- even though I know it's
           probably for the food not me...
                         
           His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and
           agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend
           Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable.
                         
                          STANDARD

           He raises his glass to her.

           loyal woman I know...

           feeling even more uncomfortable.

           It's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the
           phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music.

           He heads into the bedroom to take the call. The voice on the
           other end is accented and unfriendly.

           him in the bedroom, switching off his phone, and heads over.

           the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the
           hallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates,
           then calls out.

           Suddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open.
           Standard stands there with Benicio, holding a bag of trash. He
           pauses, then smiles.

           hiding whatever he feels inside.

           Driver seems unsure how to respond.

           great mother.
                         
           Standard rests his hand gently on Benicio's head, still staring
           at Driver.

           He's still smiling but there's a slight edge to his voice. Irene
           looks uncomfortable.
                         
                          IRENE

           Standard doesn't respond, still holding Driver's gaze.

           Well, if we're still going by the time

           good to meet you...
                         
           He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the
           corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash.
           Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as
           Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand
           there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other
           waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension.

           Cheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard
           and Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking
           excitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes
           Irene's hand gently as he listens to his son.

           A noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been
           scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out. Bernie Rose
           has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his
           investment.
                         
                          NINO
           ...We paid three hundred fucking grand for
           this?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I paid for it. Out of my own pocket.
           Anyway, that's just the shell. You start
           with the shell, then you build the frame,
           then the motor.
           (Pointing to an engine nearby)
           I paid three hundred for that. The money
           goes on the inside not the outside.
                         
                          NINO
           Fuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred
           I wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go
           waste your money on something else...
                         
           Shannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his
           deal with Bernie.
                         
                          NINO
           (Pointing to a Thunderbird)
           ...How about that fucking pussy mobile over
           there.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You buy it. Shannon sell him the car...
                         
           At the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too
           busy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the
           door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Try her out. She's more comfortable than a

           He sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all
           the control buttons as if he wants to break them.
                         
                          NINO

                          NINO
           How about this little clit? I don't know
           whether to fuck it or drive it. Fuck it,
           I'll drive it...
                         
           Bernie Rose shakes his head at his partner's foul language then
           looks away, observing Driver quietly.
                         
           Driver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work
           he doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach.
                         
           BERNIE ROSE O/S
           How you doing?...
                         
           Driver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up
           respectfully. Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           So, when's our first race?
                         
                          DRIVER

           You gonna be ready?
                         
           There's something gently challenging in his gaze.
                         
                          DRIVER

           Driver smiles but doesn't respond. Bernie Rose finds him as hard
           to talk to as everyone else. Across the garage, Nino sits in the
           T-Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him. Bernie watches
           them.

           I did some producing back in the 80's.
           Interesting pictures. Kind of European.
           Shannon arranged the cars for us and did
           all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging
           me but I loved having him around. His next
           business venture he tried the same thing
           with some of Nino's friends they broke his
           spine. He never had much luck...
                         
           He's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar
           voice.
                         
           STANDARD O/S
           Hey!...
                         
           Driver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading
           towards him with a confident smile.

           We're talking...
                         
           Bernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet
           menace and authority. Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively
           senses this is someone you don't mess with.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I'll wait outside...
                         
           Bernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then
           turns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           The reason I'm telling you this is because
           he's got a lot invested in you. So do I...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Anything you need just let me know...
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally
           walks away.

           It's a thinly veiled message that he's back and here to stay.
           Driver stares back at him when Shannon emerges from the garage
           with Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Hey, kid! Come say goodbye, the money
           people are leaving!...
                         
           Driver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then
           Driver breaks off.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Excuse me.
                         
                          STANDARD
           See you around...
                         
           Driver walks off, leaving Standard alone with his thoughts.
           Shannon watches Standard curiously as Driver approaches.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Who was that?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Irene's husband.
                         
                          SHANNON
                          (GRINNING)
           What did I tell you about married women?
                         
           Nino can't resist another dig at Shannon.
                         
                          NINO
           What the fuck do you know about married
           women?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Can you for once say something without the
           word fuck in it?
                         
           As they continue their banter, Driver glances at Standard. He's
           walking back to his car, dialling someone on his cell phone.
                         
          68 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 68
                         
           Passing traffic blurs past. Through the windows of a Mexican
           restaurant we see Irene at work, serving tables in her
           waitress's uniform.

           Driver's parked across the street, watching her from his car. He
           hesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car.
                         
          69 INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 69
                         
           Irene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops
           as she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to
           see him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over.
                         
                          IRENE
           Hi...
                         
                          DRIVER
           Hi...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise.
                         
                          IRENE
           We haven't seen you around in a while. You
           must have been pretty busy?...
                         
                          DRIVER
           You look pretty busy yourself...
                         
           She smiles, glancing at the tables she's supposed to serve.
                         
                          IRENE
           What can I get you?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I already ate. I just wanted to see how you
           were?
                         
           His concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same
           time.
                         
                          IRENE
           We're okay. Standard thinks he may have
           found a job so I can give up my night
           shift...
                         
           Driver stares back at her with his intense gaze.
                         
                          IRENE
           Benicio misses you...
                         
           From the way she says it she could almost be talking about
           herself.
                         
                          IRENE

           His gentle gaze is finally too much for her. She grins, excusing
           herself.
                         
                          IRENE
           I better serve some food...
                         
           It's only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this
           is for her. Driver watches her walk away, lost in thought.
                         
          70 INT. KITCHEN/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 70
                         
           Irene piles some plates of tacos on her tray, bracing herself to
           go back out and face Driver -- but when she finally walks out
           again he's no longer there.
                         
          71 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 71
                         
           Driver leans out of his car window and inserts a key to open the
           gates of the underground car park.
                         
          72 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - NIGHT. 72
                         
           As Driver descends into the darkness of the car park, he sees a
           group of SHADOWY FIGURES walking in the opposite direction,
           heading up the ramp, one of them being pushed in a wheelchair.
           Their leader, a large, balding man, (COOK), glances in Driver's
           direction then looks away.
                         
           Driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way
           further down the car park. Suddenly he notices something else in
           the shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars.
           A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car
           now, climbing out to see what's happened.
                         
           The prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he
           realizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he
           clutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at
           his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver
           kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Can you move?

           He's right here...
                         
           Driver glances at Benicio. He looks terrified. Standard raises
           his head painfully and looks at his son.

           Standard is bent over the sink, splashing water on his face. As
           he turns off the tap he notices how neatly Driver's laid out his
           toothbrush, shaving cream, and razor. He finally turns around
           and looks at Driver.

           over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The
           little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go.

           An outdoor food shack in a park. COOK, the leader of the group
           of men who beat Standard up in the parking lot, sits at a table
           with his girlfriend, BLANCHE, a stunning blonde with short
           cropped hair.
                         
                          COOK
           I've got you to do this fucking job for me,
           why do I need to pay someone else?
                         
           Standard sits next to Driver, holding his ground even though
           he's clearly intimidated by the Albanian.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I'll pay him out of what's left of my
           share. I can't do something like this on my
           own.

           You got Blanche...
                         
           He grins, looking at Driver now. Blanche doesn't even seem to
           hear them, hung-over from the previous night.
                         
                          COOK
           You look like you're hard to work with?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not if we understand each other.
                         
                          COOK
           What's to understand? It's my score. Either
           you sign on or you don't.
                         
           Driver stares at him quietly, finding it hard to conceal his
           contempt.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I drive. That's all I do.
                         
           Blanche gets up from the table before Cook can respond.
                         
                          COOK
           Where are you going?
                         
                          BLANCHE
           They've forgotten my Coke.
                         
                          COOK
           They'll bring it. Sit down.
           (His eyes still fixed on Driver)
           Standard, why don't you hire a fucking taxi
           cab?
                         
                          STANDARD
           He didn't mean it like that, man...
                         
           Standard looks worried, trying to diffuse the tension.
                         
                          COOK
           So, what does he mean?
                         
           Driver looks him calmly in the eye.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You tell me where we start, where we're
           headed, where we'll be going afterwards. I
           don't take part, I don't carry weapons, I
           drive...
                         
           Standard seems surprised by Driver's professional patter. So
           does Cook. Even Blanche looks interested for once.

           Standard, get Blanche her coca cola.
                         
           Standard hesitates, but has no choice. As he leaves to fetch
           Blanche her drink, Cook starts to write something down on the
           palm of his hand.
                         
                          COOK
           Okay, here's the deal. This much for
           Blanche, this much for that asshole minus
           what he owes me, and this much for you...
                         
           He holds up the palm of his hand to Driver, the words Fuck Off
           written in marker pen.
                         
                          COOK
           You still interested?
                         
           Driver looks at him, all his instincts telling him to walk away,
           but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene and Benicio.
                         
                          COOK
           Good. Anything else?...
                         
           Driver stares back at him with his clear blue eyes.
                         
                          DRIVER
           We do this job he's paid his debt. You
           leave him and his family alone...
                         
           Cook looks surprised at first, then laughs at his nerve.
                         
                          COOK

           The midday sun beats down on a maze of cars. Driver strolls past
           rows of glittering vehicles until he spots an old model Mustang.
                         
          78 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 78
                         
           Driver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio
           now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife.
                         
                          STANDARD
           ...I was such a jerk the first time we met.
           We're at this party and I see the most
           beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I
           walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's
           Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me
           and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'...
                          (HE LAUGHS)
           It took me like a minute to get it...

           Irene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager
           to please his dad.
                         
                          STANDARD
           You don't get it either do you, Benicio?
           Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains.
                         
           He ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of
           tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver.
                         
                          IRENE
           Would you like some more chicken?

           Thanks...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the
           look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass
           and tuck into his food.
                         
                          STANDARD
           Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken.
           Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant
           together once I raise the money. That's why
           she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure
           out how it's done. She's got more ambition
           than anyone I know, more smarts too...

           Mexicans out of business -

           He raises his glass to Driver now. Driver senses how nervous he
           is about the job ahead, and how uncomfortable he is depending on
           someone his wife clearly admires.

           Standard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms
           and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even
           in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son.
           Irene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver.

           Driver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more
           torn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates.

           Driver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He
           stares out, then turns on a stop watch, listening to it tick,
           finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual.

           The pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside,
           another anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a
           hundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling.
           Standard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense.

           of his window he sees Blanche cross the street and enter the
           pawn shop and looks even more nervous now.

                          DRIVER
           It's not too late...
                         
           Standard considers a moment, then shakes his head.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I gotta do this for them...
                         
           He forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens
           the door.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You got five minutes...
                         
                          STANDARD
                          (GRINNING)
           I'll see you in four...
                         
           Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of
           foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his
           stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.
                         
           He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest
           details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of
           overlooking buildings.
                         
           The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop
           windows, hiding everything inside.
                         
           The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver
           listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the
           engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading
           for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
                         
           He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.
           Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
           glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different
           from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.
           For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers
           and racing tires.
                         
           Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from
           the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting
           Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
                         
           But there's no sign of them.
                         
           The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his
           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,
           thinking of Irene.
                         
           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,
           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.

           He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on
           his face as he spins around.
                         
           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in
           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The
           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
                         
           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from
           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look
           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots
           crack behind him.
                         
           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly
           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.
                         
          82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82
                         
           Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           ...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this
           much money!...
                         
           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Move for Chrissakes!...
                         
           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
           speed.
                         
           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
                         
           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
           move, staying on his tail.
                         
           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

           Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
           the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
                         
           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
           regains control of his car.
                         
           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
                         
           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,
           Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang
           closing fast.
                         
           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
           for an instant.
                         
           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
                         
           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
           spinning 270 degrees.
                         
           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
           corner he can't control. 
                         
           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
           sickening crunch of metal on metal.
                         
           Driver guns the motor and speeds away.

           The black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim
           with stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale.
                         
                          DRIVER

           She glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is.
           Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking
           through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery
           yet. He zips up the bag and heads out.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Stay here. Don't answer the door...

           room. Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed. Driver
           picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he
           finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery. There is a
           police mug-shot of Standard on screen.

           again, confronted with the reality of what's happened.
                         
                          TV REPORT

           As she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed
           where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped
           open as if she's called someone recently.
                         
           Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette
           of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door
           handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly
           there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
                         
           Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.
           He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.
                         
          87 INT. BATHROOM/ MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 87
                         
           Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts
           through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her
           head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a
           big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom
           window where he just shot her.
                         
           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
                         
           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
           hitman and grabs his shotgun.
                         
          88 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 88
                         
           In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.
           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
           doll.
                         
           The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
           it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
           his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
           all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
           man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
                         
           Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
           pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.

           An underworld doctor, "DOC", a shabbily dressed old man who
           looks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch
           along with his surgical tools, preparing for Driver's arrival.
           Shannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he
           hears a noise in the garage.

           towards him in the gloom. Shannon can't help glancing at his
           hands, expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money, but
           there's no sign of it.

           grandchildren and movie posters from Hollywood's golden age.
           Bernie is in his silk pyjamas, looking like he's just woken up.

           Sunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs,
           passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful
           of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is
           empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS
           emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he
           puts them at ease with a friendly smile.

           waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.
                         
           Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing
           him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a
           heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's
           left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face.
           Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Should've figured you for a shill. Who were
           you fronting for?
                         
                          COOK
           Fuck you -
                         
           Driver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking
           it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the
           door but Driver couldn't care less.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Whose money am I holding?
                         
                          COOK
           Don't worry. They'll come get it. You don't
           know who you're fucking with -
                         
           Driver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting
           Cook's left hand. He screams like a stuck pig.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Who's money am I holding?
                         
                          COOK
           (Barely able to get the words out)
           Fuck you...
                         
           The strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time. Driver
           bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds
           what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the
           call log and finds the same number appearing again and again.

           The kitchen is busy, CHEFS taking out hot pizzas from the oven
           and slicing them up in takeaway boxes. In the background we hear
           the phone ringing.

           An impeccably dressed MAN IN A TAN SUIT answers the phone.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           Hello?...I'm afraid we're closed. Could you

           Driver leans against his car, talking on Cook's cell phone.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I could, but your boss won't be happy when
           he finds out you've kept him waiting...
                         
           Tan Suit looks curious now.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           Can I ask what this is about?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I have something that belongs to him.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           And that would be?
                         
                          DRIVER
           A million dollars...
                         
           There's a pause on the other line now.

           Tan Suit walks into the dining area. A large bull of a man sits
           on his own in the empty restaurant with his back to us. It's
           only when he hears Tan Suit approach and turns around that we
           realize it's Nino, Bernie's partner.

           me?...
                         
           The voice is unmistakable. Driver stares quietly.
                         
                          DRIVER

           I'm not selling. I give you a time and

                          DRIVER
           Just that. Out of it. You put a muzzle on
           Cook, forget your zombies at the Motel,
           forget we ever had this conversation...
                         
           Nino's thinking to himself, looking more concerned than he
           sounds.

           Just you...
                         
           Nino begins to relax now, still calculating.
                         
                          NINO
           You're not very good at this, are you?...

           Irene is sitting on the couch next to Benicio, talking to him
           gently as he watches TV.
                         
                          IRENE
           ...I'll be back before you go to bed. How's
           that sound?...
                         
           The little boy nods, watching his Japanese cartoon. Irene's
           friend, Cindy, is also there, gazing at them both in sympathy.
           Irene looks up at her.
                         
                          IRENE
           Are you going to be okay?
                         
                          CINDY
           We'll be fine...
                         
           Irene gets up to leave when the buzzer rings. She walks over and
           opens the door then stops in surprise. Driver stands there.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You got a minute?...
                         
           She looks at him in a daze.
                         
                          IRENE
           Where have you been?...
                         
           He stares back at her in silence.
                         
                          IRENE
           I tried to reach you. Standard's been -

           I know...
                         
           His eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something
           more. She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a
           small voice interrupts.

           I'm sorry about your father...
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any
           more words of comfort. Irene watches him, still stunned. He
           looks back at her.
                         
                          IRENE
           I can't talk now. I have to go.

           Can I give you a ride?
                         
           She stares at him in dismay, close to tears.
                         
                          IRENE
           The car's working fine.

           Then let me walk you down...

           Why?...
                         
           Driver misunderstands, thinking she's talking about Standard.
                         
                          DRIVER
           He was into one of the prison gangs for a
           lot of money. He was trying to protect you.

           Great job...
                         
           She walks faster now, striding towards the elevator. Driver
           follows her.

                          IRENE

           She turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open,
           revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but
           we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused.

           She steps into the elevator. Driver follows her in.

           Driver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each
           other. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but
           Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights
           on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they
           reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for
           him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the
           darkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of
           them heading in the opposite direction.
                         
          107 INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 107
                         
           The overhead lights flicker, the huge underground car park
           hidden in shadow. Driver walks alongside Irene in silence. In
           the distance Tan Suit's footsteps slowly fade.

           I'm leaving. I want you to come with me...
                         
           Irene can't believe what she's hearing.
                         
                          IRENE
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          DRIVER
           You and Benicio...
                         
           She's almost too stunned to speak, walking even faster now.
                         
                          IRENE
           You're crazy. I don't even know you -
                         
                          DRIVER
           You will. Once I straighten out this thing
           I'm getting out for good. We'll go some
           place. Anywhere you want.
                         
           She shakes her head, fighting her feelings for him.
                         
                          IRENE
           It doesn't work like that.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Why not?...
                         
           She stops and looks at him.
                         
                          IRENE
           Because people like you never get out. And
           I don't want my son to grow up like that...
                         
           She holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when
           suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his
           eye.
                         
           A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling
           her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of
           the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.
                         
           Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other
           parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering
           her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
                         
           More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
           car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
                         
           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
           Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
           parked cars.

           Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She
           looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
           all her worst fears have been confirmed.
                         
           Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps
           approaching.
                         
           He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and
           runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
                         
           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
           the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
           reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
                         
           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
                         
           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
           footsteps.
                         
           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
           time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
           car.
                         
           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
           him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
                         
           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
                         
           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
                         
           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
           Tan Suit's skull.
                         
           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
           elevator, framed against the light.
                         
           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
                         
           Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The
           elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.

           Shannon gets out of his car. Driver is waiting for him by his
           own car, silhouetted against the streetlight. Shannon stares at
           him a moment, then notices the blood stains on his shirt.

           Shannon takes a moment to reply, looking dazed.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I called Bernie...I asked if he could help.
           Him and Nino are like brothers. I told him
           you weren't interested in the money, that
           you only did it for the girl...
           (From the heart)
           I wanted to make sure once you returned the
           money that was the end of it...
                         
           Driver doesn't seem to hear him.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Let me talk to Bernie again. They probably

                          DRIVER
           They're gonna come after you to find me.
           You have to leave...
                         
           Shannon takes this in slowly.
                         
                          SHANNON
           What are you gonna do?...

                          BERNIE ROSE
           ...I already gave you my advice. You should
           have taken your money and left this guy
           alone.
                         
           Nino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now.
                         
                          NINO
           It's not that simple, Bernie.

           He looks at Cook's broken hands.

           Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as
           he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the
           windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain.
                         
                          NINO
           ...The money belonged to a half assed
           wiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was
           keeping a million in a pawn shop and was
           gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a
           rival operation. I wanted to teach him a
           lesson...

           Cook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds. Nino
           looks almost embarrassed for once.

                          NINO
           That's why this driver has to go. Him, and
           maybe your friend Shannon, are the only two
           people who can tie me to the robbery.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           What about this prick?
                         
           He doesn't even bother to look at Cook.
                         
                          COOK
           Mr. Paolozzi -
                         
                          NINO
           Shut up...
                         
           The two friends stare at each other as if Cook didn't exist.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Are you asking my permission?
                         
                          NINO
           I'm asking for your help. I shoulda' come
           to you first, Bernie. I know that. We're a
           team.
                         
           He stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their
           friendship.
                         
                          NINO
           I'll pay you back the three hundred you
           spent on the race car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           It's not about the money...
                         
           He stares out quietly, torn.

           Pass the salt...
                         
           Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having
           two broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final
           straw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it
           in his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it
           in his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then
           with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.
                         
           Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his
           own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           The CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the
           background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene.
           Driver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the
           make-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around
           the trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask
           he saw previously on the film set.

           Shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in
           his hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops.
           Bernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Bernie Rose heads towards him with his hands in his coat
           pockets.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

                          SHANNON
           You break in like this I figure it's bad
           news.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           It's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this
           city a year, he had to pick the wrong one.
                         
                          SHANNON
           He tried to put it right.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Picked the wrong guy for that too. My
           partner's a belligerent asshole with his
           back against the wall...
                         
           He stops, facing Shannon.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Right now so am I. I don't take care of
           this I'm in big trouble...
                         
           He stares at his old friend.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Any idea where he is?
                         
                          SHANNON
           Probably across the border by now. Mexico.
           Belize. That's where I'd go...
                         
           Bernie Rose smiles, not believing a word.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           He just walked out on you after everything
           you've done for him, took all the money?

           That's gratitude, I guess.
                         
           Bernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite
           everything.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been
           friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a
           neighborhood of wops. Long as I can
           remember he was getting me into trouble and
           I was getting him out of scrapes...
                         
           He looks almost apologetic.

                          BERNIE ROSE
           I leave here without finding out where he
           is, there'll be others coming after me. I
           guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure

           Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny
           stock car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You know, it's too bad, I was getting
           excited about our race team, having my name
           all over the car. I think we could have
           made something of this business...
                         
                          SHANNON
           Nah, I'd have fucked it up too...
                         
           Shannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and
           extends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends,
           when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.
                         
           We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein
           cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed,
           paralysed with shock.
                         
           Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with
           Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him
           down against the boot of the stock car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and
           you'll fall asleep...
                         
           Shannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him. Bernie
           Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a
           handkerchief.

           Bernie Rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box
           full of other knives. From next door he can hear his neighbors
           arguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly
           storms towards his front door.

           There's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now. The
           husband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his
           elbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife.

           You're lucky to have her, lucky she's put

           Sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows
           down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings,
           glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the
           garage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.

           Driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage
           cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the
           vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock
           car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently
           against the trunk of the car.
                         
           Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for
           a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and
           opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of
           money.

           shoes or socks, listening on his cell phone. We hold on the
           curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed
           WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,
           also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting
           ready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone.
                         
                          NINO
           Alright honey, I'll pick you up in an hour.
                         
          116 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 116
                         
           Two big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we
           recognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it
           again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask.
           He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria.

          117 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 117
                         
           Several of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them
           recognize him.
                         
                          NINO'S GUY
           We're closed...
                         
           Driver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by
           more of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out
           again.
                         
          118 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - NIGHT. 118
                         
           Nino emerges with his bodyguards now, heading towards one of the
           white Lincolns.
                         
                          NINO
           (To one of his men)
           I'm going to pick up my wife. I'll meet you
           there...
                         
           Across the road Driver climbs into his car, still wearing the
           mask. He starts his car, setting off after Nino's Lincoln.
                         
          119 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - NIGHT. 119
                         
           Driver drifts in behind a couple of other cars, keeping them
           between himself and the Lincoln.
                         
          120 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 120
                         
           The sunlight is fading fast. The neon cityscape has come to life
           and the streets are a sea of glittering lights.
                         
          121 INT. NINO'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 121
                         
           The CHAUFFEUR checks his mirror as he turns into another street,
           seeing only the anonymous glare of headlights behind him.
                         
          122 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 122
                         
           Driver slows down and lets another car turn in front of him,
           keeping it between himself and Nino's car.
                         
          123 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 123
                         
           The streets are less crowded in this residential area. As the
           car in front of Driver pulls into its front drive, Driver takes
           the next turning, making sure the Lincoln doesn't spot him.
                          76
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          124 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PARALLEL STREET - NIGHT. 124
                         
           Driver cruises along another residential street. At every
           intersection we glimpse the Lincoln heading in the same
           direction down a parallel street.
                         
          125 EXT. SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD/ BRENTWOOD - NIGHT. 125
                         
           The Lincoln turns back into traffic on San Vincente.
                         
          126 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 126
                         
           Nino's talking on a cell phone in the back seat.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Sure, Carlo, I'll send him your
           regards...
                         
          127 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 127
                         
           Driver merges in with the traffic, weaving between the cars in
           front of him until he has Nino's Lincoln back in his sights.
                         
          128 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 128
                         
           The sun has almost set, the red backlights of the cars blinking
           in the fading light.
                         
          129 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 129
                         
           Nino's car turns into 7th Street.
                         
          130 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 130
                         
           This time there are no other vehicles turning into the same
           street. Driver has no choice, settling in behind the Lincoln.
                         
          131 INT. NINO'S CAR/ 7TH STREET/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 131
                         
           The chauffeur glances in his rear-view mirror and spots Driver's
           car for the first time. For now he doesn't give it much thought.
           In the back seat Nino finally says goodbye on the phone.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Nice talking to you too...
           (As he hangs up)
           Asshole...
                         
          132 EXT. ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 132
                         
           Both cars head into Entrada Drive.
                          77
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          133 INT. NINO'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 133
                         
           The chauffeur checks his mirror again and notices Driver's car
           still on his tail. Just as a precaution he slows down, seeing if
           the pursuing car will overtake.
                         
          134 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE - NIGHT. 134
                         
           Driver has to decide in an instant whether to take up the
           invitation. He overtakes the Lincoln, speeding ahead.
                         
          135 INT. NINO'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 135
                         
           Nino's chauffeur sees Driver's car disappear up ahead, relaxing
           now.
                         
          136 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ WEST CHANNEL ROAD/ PCH - NIGHT. 136
                         
           Driver puts his foot on the gas, taking sharp turns on small
           side streets, driving fast around the block until he's back on
           the Lincoln's tail, keeping a safe distance now.
                         
          137 INT. NINO'S CAR/ W.CHANNEL RD./ PCH - NIGHT. 137
                         
           Nino's chauffeur turns right into the Pacific Coast Highway.
                         
          138 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 138
                         
           Driver follows the Lincoln at a distance, keeping the winding
           corners of the PCH between himself and his prey.
                         
          139 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 139
                         
           From above we see Driver's car gliding along the open highway,
           the rising hills on one side, the churning ocean on the other,
           no vehicles in sight.
                         
          140 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 140
                         
           In the back seat Nino dials another number on his cell-phone.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Bernie, it's me...
                         
          141 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 141
                         
           The headlights of Driver's car sweep ahead of it on the open
           road. From above it looks like a shark closing in on its prey.
                         
          142 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ LA - NIGHT. 142
                         
           Bernie Rose stands by the window, listening to the phone in
           silence.
                          78
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          143 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 143
                         
           Nino sounds apologetic.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Look, about that thing today...I'm
           sorry. I know how much you liked the guy...
                         
           In his rear view mirror the chauffeur sees the headlights of the
           car behind getting closer.
                         
          144 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 144
                         
           Driver stares ahead, his eyes fixed on the Lincoln's backlights.
                         
          145 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 145
                         
           Bernie Rose doesn't speak, looking weary.
                         
           NINO O/S
           Bernie?...
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Yeah?...
                         
           NINO O/S
           You're the only fucking person in the world
           I trust. I love you, man...
                         
           Bernie shakes his head, the same old apologies.
                         
          146 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 146
                         
           In the front seat Nino's chauffeur checks his mirror curiously.
                         
                          NINO
           When this is over I'll make it up to you, I
           swear...
                         
           The lights of the car behind have vanished.
                         
          147 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 147
                         
           Even from above we can't see Driver's car with its lights off -
           no idea how close it is to Nino's car.
                         
          148 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 148
                         
           Even though he's still angry, Bernie can't help forgiving his
           childhood friend.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           How many times I heard that before...
                          79
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          149 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 149
                         
           Nino grins.
                         
                          NINO
           I lost count -
                         
           Suddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him.
                         
          150 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 150
                         
           Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting
           it just above the left rear wheel.
                         
          151 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 151
                         
           The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in
           the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the
           tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards.
                         
          152 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 152
                         
           Bernie Rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead.
                         
          153 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 153
                         
           The collision has barely knocked Driver off course. His car
           skids to a stop near the overturned wreck.
                         
          154 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 154
                         
           Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He
           unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.
                         
          155 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155
                         
           Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the
           pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach
           but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the
           other passengers are dead, then heads on.
                         
          156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156
                         
           Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He
           looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps
           running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear
           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
                         
           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.

           Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more
           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
                         
           They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver
           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.
           Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in
           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
           splutters as Driver lets him up again.
                         
                          NINO
           It was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your
           friend not me...
                         
           Driver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there
           until Nino's body finally stops thrashing.
                         
          157 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ BEL AIR - NIGHT. 157
                         
           A phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Nino?
                         
           DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
           He's dead.
                         
           Bernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a
           part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
           no trace of emotion in his voice.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Looks like me, you and your girlfriend are
           the only pieces left on the board...

           Driver is no longer wearing a mask, framed against the ocean. He
           catches the veiled threat in Bernie's words but doesn't respond.

           A large Chinese restaurant. We follow Driver through the crowd.
           He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring
           himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,
           wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Care for a glass?...
                         
           Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table.
           Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I can recommend the duck. Hell, I can
           recommend everything -- Walnut prawns,
           shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the
           duck's to die for...
                         
           He delivers the last line with a pointed smile, then turns away,
           calling over a WAITRESS.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           The duck, please. For two.

           No, thanks...
                         
           He waits for the waitress to leave, then turns back to Driver.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You've been on a roll. Cut yourself quite a
           swath out there.

                          BERNIE ROSE
           We usually don't. But it comes down on our
           heads regardless. Look at Shannon...
                         
           Driver holds his gaze, the tension palpable, laughter and
           conversation drifting over from the other tables.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Anyway it's water under the bridge now.
           Question is where does that leave us?
                         
                          DRIVER
           That's up to you.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You bring the cash?
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him quietly.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Tell me something, how does someone with no
           interest in money get mixed up in a heist?
           (Off his silence)
           Shannon told me it was because of the girl?
                         
           Driver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern. Bernie sees it
           and smiles.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Don't worry. Nobody else knows about her.
           Just me...
                          (A BEAT)
           You still see her?...

           She's not interested.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           She's got her head screwed on right. I got
           two ex-wives, three kids, four
           grandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me
           now...
                         
           He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of
           sympathy.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           This is what I'll do for you. You give me
           the money, nobody knows she exists. But
           it's a different matter with you.

           Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half
           hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk,
           taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't
           even look at it, still admiring the car.

           Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's
           hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into
           Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this
           time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to
           his throat.
                         
           Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something
           like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking
           deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he
           dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then
           Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
                         
           Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and
           puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.

           Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood-
           soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and
           hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood
           dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets
           off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on
           his cell-phone.

           left it in a parking lot on the corner of
           Culver and Lincoln. Section M 10...
                         
           Irene writes down the details, looking even more confused.
                         
           DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
           There's a bag in the trunk with some money.
           Keys are under the left rear wheel...
                         
                          IRENE
           What do you want me to do with it?...
                         
           Driver walks with difficulty, finding it hard to breathe.
                         
                          DRIVER
           It's yours. It's safe to keep it...
                         
           All around him the Chevys, Dodges, and Fords glitter in the
           sunlight.
                         
                          IRENE
           I told you, I don't need your money...
                         
           Blood seeps through Driver's shirt, dripping on the tarmac.
                         
           Irene hears his labored breathing now, looking concerned.

           Are you okay?...
                         
           Driver's skin looks deathly pale, his eyes a haunting shade of
           blue. He keeps walking through the maze of cars, casting his
           eyes from one vehicle to the next, looking for the perfect ride.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Just out of breath...
                         
           Finally he spots a beautiful white Camaro up ahead.
                         
                          DRIVER
           How're you doing?...
                         
           For the first time we see the Echo Park fountain sparkling in
           the background.
                         
                          IRENE
           Fine. I'm in the park with Benicio...
                         
           Irene can no longer hold back her tears, heartbroken.
                         
           Driver stops in front of the white Camaro, unsteady on his feet.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I gotta go Irene...
                         
           He pauses.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Meeting you was the best thing that ever
           happened to me...
                         
           Irene smiles sadly.
                         
                          IRENE
           It was nice to meet you too...
                         
          165 EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 165
                         
           From above we see the maze of vehicles stretching out forever --
           Chevys, Chryslers, Fords -- the history of America on wheels.
           Driver switches off his cell-phone reluctantly then heads
           towards the Camaro.

           Driver climbs into the front seat of the Camaro, catching his
           breath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world
           outside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until
           he finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the
           steering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn
           signal.

           His face shows the strain, but his fingers are as steady as
           ever. A master at work. Finally he breaks into the ignition
           device, leaning back in the seat to take a rest.

           Driver's face is completely still now. So are his eyes. He looks
           almost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans
           forward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life,
           we CUT TO BLACK.

          EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY

          Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station
          make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
          ghost town âcept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
          ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
          how long ago this place went dry.
          Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
          PLUMES of dust skyward.

          INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY

          Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
          FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
          MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and
          FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Goddamned old man!

                         FUCKING PASSENGER
          I thought he was dead! She said he
          was dead!

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I don't see him. Just go. I think
          we lost him.

          EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY

          They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for
          the main road in the distance when they round a corner --
          --to face a â70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine
          screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because
          these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before:

                         MILTON
          âThe Old Manâ, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner,
          locks the tires and spins the wheel.
          The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM!
          The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would

                         BUT:
          MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window.
          Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN -
          Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it:
          TITLE CARD appears--

                         "DRIVE ANGRY"
          --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the
          words right at us!

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up,
          SLAMS the windshield.
          Truck CAREENS out of control!
          Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
          KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
          Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
          SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
          The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
          The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
          dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
          Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
          Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
          Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
          Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
          --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger
          screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --

          KER-ACK!
          -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard.
          Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.

          OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER
          Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to
          his feet and runs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver
          SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
          got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
          windshield. He looks up --
          -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I'll never tell you where they've
          taken her...NEVER.

                         MILTON
          I know.
          The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.

          ON FUCKING DRIVER
          As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
          of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
          at Milton standing over him.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          You...you took my leg you fuck!
          Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Wait. Wait!

                         MILTON
          Where is she?

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          I...I don't...
          Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
          up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
          Milton spins and KAFOOM!
          Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I
          don't know where exactly. They
          call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I
          know. I swear!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a
          moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          But you're too late. You gotta
          know that. Next full moon she's
          dead. Nothing you can do. She's
          dead and hell will walk the earth--

          WHAM!
          Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
          breaking a couple teeth in the process.
          Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
          his thirst in a decade.

                         MILTON
          You tell him I'm coming. You got
          that? I'm coming to get her back.
          You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna
          kill every last one of you fuckers.
          Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't
          look back.

          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.
          It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot
          dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound â67
          GTO stands out.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
          those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
          PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
          couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
          Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
          kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
          joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
          scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.

                         PIPER
          So I tell him, I says, âFrank,
          that's it. No more free milk. You
          gonna have to buy the cow you son
          of a bitch.â

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         NORMAJEAN
          But you're not fat, Piper

                         PIPER
          Wha? No, NormaJean, âbuy the cow.â
          Marry me? He's got to marry me.
          I'm sayin I cut him off.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You cut him off?

                         PIPER
          Not just yes but hell yes! No
          tits, no ass. And I told him if I
          see that big ol' dick of his
          anywhere near my face I'm gonna
          bite it in half.
          Normajean giggles with embarrassment.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You said that? How long's it been?
          Piper frowns.

                         PIPER
          Well, it's only been two days but
          that's like a decade in horny
          fucker years.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So he bought you a diamond?

                         PIPER
          A diamond? God no. If Frank had
          money for a diamond I would have
          jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
          put this shithole life in the rear
          view. But he did get down on his
          knees and ask me to be his bride.

                         NORMAJEAN
          No way.

                         PIPER
          Yes way!
          NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Oh! Piper!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         PIPER

          I KNOW!

          FF-FF-FFUMP!
          Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
          Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.

                         PIPER
          Did...did you just throw scrambled
          eggs at us?

                         FAT LOU
          I don't pay you bitches to stand
          around. Now get the fuck back to work!
          Piper snatches one of the plates.
          She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
          toward the newly arrived customers.
          The American Indian couple scans a menu...
          ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
          NormaJean steps up to Milton.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Hello beautiful, coffee?

                         MILTON
          That'd be great. Tell me,
          Stillwater Marsh around here?

                         NORMAJEAN
          (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
          a bell. I'll get that coffee.
          But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
          She quickly looks away. She knows something...
          Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
          --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.

                         PIPER
          Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
          you something to drink?

                         MOTHER MARY
          We'll take this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.

                         PIPER
          âShe's a Brickhouseâ breakfast.
          Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.

                         MOTHER MARY
          And five waters.

                         PIPER
          Five waters. And what can I get for...
          Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.

                         MOTHER MARY
          That's it. Just the pancakes. If
          that's okay?
          Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
          they're hungry. And broke.

                         PIPER
          Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
          Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
          Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
          attention. She's ignoring him.
          Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.

                         PIPER
          One brickhouse.
          She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
          kept fresh within a glass cake stand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.

                         MILTON
          Stillwater Marsh? You know it?
          Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.

                         DALE
          No. We don't.

                         MILTON
          It's important.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         MOTHER MARY
          You're in the wrong state.

                         DALE
          Mary!

                         MILTON
          And what state Should I be in?
          Dale turns, glares at Milton.

                         DALE
          Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
          It's a two day drive from here.

                         MILTON
          And Wolf Deer Run?

                         DALE
          Never heard of it.
          The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
          that's where The Smiling Man takes
          the wicked children to see the
          Mother of all things.
          Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.

                         MILTON
          Mother of all things, that sounds
          very interesting.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Oh it is! The Mother of all things
          bleeds black tears unto those who

                         CUT HER--
          Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.

                         MOTHER MARY
          It's nothing. Just a story parents
          tell to their children. Like the
          boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
          A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
          leans in with three kiddie cups.

                         PIPER
          And three milks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         MOTHER MARY
          But we didn't order--

                         PIPER
          (whispers) --On the house.
          She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
          doesn't notice...

                         MILTON
          staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
          Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So, aren't you gonna ask what time
          my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
          I'm always a little ârandy' during
          full moon.

                         MILTON
          Full moon's three days off.

                         NORMAJEAN
          (she touches his hand)
          You sure âbout that, sweetie?

                         MILTON
          Pretty sure. (looks outside) Hell
          of a ride out there. Yours?

                         NORMAJEAN
          The GTO? I wish.

                         MILTON
          (glances at Piper)
          Hers?

                         NORMAJEAN
          Sure but if you're lookin' for a
          ride...

                         MILTON
          And would you be gentle?

                         NORMAJEAN
          Life's too short for that, sweetie.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - KITCHEN - DAY

          Piper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops
          them into a soapy sink. She turns right into --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         FAT LOU
          He glares down at her.

                         PIPER
          Jesus Lou, back the fuck off.

                         FAT LOU
          âOn the houseâ? On the fucking
          house?

                         PIPER
          Oh relax. We gotta toss them
          muffins out today anyway.
          She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.

          INT. HIGHWAY 50 - FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          As Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind,
          spins her around.

                         PIPER
          Get your hand off of me!
          His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.

                         FAT LOU
          You get over there and you charge
          them for those muff...
          Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
          fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
          hear the CRUNCH.
          Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
          forehead into the bridge of his nose!

          KER-RACK!

                         PIPER
          I told you, you fat fuck son of a
          bitch, never to touch me again!
          His nose seeps blood.

                         FAT LOU
          Let...go...of...my...
          She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         PIPER
          Shut up.
          She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
          nuts. He has no choice but follow.
          She pulls him up to the American Indian family.

                         PIPER
          Tell'em.

                         FAT LOU
          Wha...what?
          We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
          wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.

                         PIPER
          Tell them...the muffins...are on
          the house.

                         FAT LOU
          On. The. House.
          She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
          floor as Piper turns to the family.
          The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.

                         PIPER
          I'm sorry your kids had to see
          that. Put some honey butter on
          those bran muffins and they taste
          an awful lot better.
          Piper turns and crosses toward the door.
          NormaJean is pale as she watches her go.
          Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but
          Milton is gone.

          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          We're close on a car door as it SLAMS.
          CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with
          life. An âI brake for pussyâ bumper sticker stands out.
          THE BACK GLASS vibrates as MUSIC blares from within.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear
          shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

          With Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway...
          ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag
          thrown over his shoulder.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper SINGS. She's empowered. Then...

          KA-THUNK.
          She grips the wheel.
          The RPMS drop.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

          The GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath
          the hood.
          CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS.
          Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours
          her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack
          shit about engines.
          FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready.
          Milton appears through the smoke.

                         MILTON
          Car trouble?
          Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing.
          Milton glances at the engine.

                         MILTON
          Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix
          that for you if you like.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         PIPER
          I would. Thank you.

                         MILTON
          If you give me a lift.

                         PIPER
          I'm only going as far as Blackfoot
          Falls. The truckstop there.

                         MILTON
          And I'd be much obliged.
          Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the
          hood shut with a smile.

                         MILTON
          Shall we?

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in
          the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper.
          Suddenly Piper turns on him.

                         PIPER
          Get it straight old man. I ain't
          sleeping with you.
          Milton chuckles.

                         MILTON
          Darlin, my days of bedding a gal ten
          minutes after I meet her are over.

                         PIPER
          Yeah. Well, that's good to hear.

                         MILTON

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          For now, anyway.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY

          Several big rigs are parked near the truck stop. A few
          derelict vehicles outside the adjacent run down old motel.
          Piper's GTO pulls in and parks near the road.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Piper climbs out. Milton rises stiffly and crosses toward
          her as he tosses the duffle over his shoulder. He offers his
          hand, gives her a smile.

                         MILTON
          âPreciate the ride, ma'am.
          Milton crosses toward an old Superman style phone booth.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY

          Piper inserts her key, glances back at Milton.
          He's in the booth now, his back to her.
          Piper turns the key and opens the door.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY

          First thing we see is MONA'S naked ass and back. Long red
          hair, she is riding a naked FRANK. Neither realizes Piper
          has opened the door.

                         MONA
          Oh Frank, you know how long I've
          wanted to feel you inside me?

                         FRANK
          Faster.

                         MONA
          Oh, you want it faster?
          Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster.
          Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and
          yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper
          drags Mona backwards off the bed.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY

          Piper drags Mona, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the lot, then
          drops her and whirls toward the room--
          -- where Frank struggles, desperate to find his pants.

                         MONA
          What's the matter with you?! You
          psycho bitch from...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.
          Piper spins on Mona, points a finger in warning.

                         PIPER
          Don't.
          It shuts Mona up.
          Piper storms back toward the room.

                         HER POV
          Frank hops with one leg in his jeans. He sees her coming.
          Although he's a big fella, he looks scared.
          Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across
          the face!

                         MONA
          Fuck you, Piper, we're in lo--

          WHAM!
          Piper clocks Mona!
          Mona stands there...dazed. Swaying. Confused.

                         PIPER
          What was that? I didn't catch that
          last word.

                         MONA
          Oh...I...I said...we're in lo--

          WHAM!
          This time Mona stumbles backwards and CRASHES into a metal
          chair on the motel porch.
          Piper brushes passed her.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY

          Piper stuffs a gym bag with clothes.

                         FRANK
          Now baby, just hold on.

                         PIPER
          I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come
          near me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         FRANK
          Look, sooner you accept this is
          your fault, the better.
          Piper stops, turns, stares.

                         FRANK
          Baby, I can't just turn it off.
          Now you know that. I gotta have
          it. At least once a day. It's in
          the wiring. You did this. You
          made me cheat on you. You're lucky
          I'm not more pissed about it.
          Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker
          punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door.

                         FRANK
          Piper! Now cut it out. Enough
          with the drama!

          INT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S MOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

          Milton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear
          is a fake out.
          Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around.

                         HIS POV

          THE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70
          ...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at
          Milton, cell phone to his ear. He sees Milton see him,
          quickly backs into the shadows.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          Piper!

          EXT. LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY

          Piper exits, glances at Mona, sprawled out unconscious in the
          metal chair, an ASIAN MAN in a Hawaiian shirt SNAPS pictures
          of her.
          Piper snatches the camera and flings it against the wall
          where it SHATTERS.

                         ASIAN MAN
          Hey?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         PIPER
          Pervert.
          Piper stomps across the lot as Frank exits, calls to her.

                         FRANK
          Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we
          talk about this?
          Piper keeps walking. Never looks back.

                         FRANK
          Piper, stop this! You got nowhere
          to go and you know it.

                         PIPER
          I'll go to San Francisco and stay
          with my cousin.

                         FRANK
          (Realization) Whoa. You ain't
          taking my car.
          Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger.

                         FRANK
          I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch.
          Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and --

          WHAM!
          -- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank
          stumbles, nearly goes down.

                         PIPER
          Your car?! Who's been making the
          payments you out of work, skanky
          Mona fucking piece of shit?!
          She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS
          and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation.
          Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM!

                         FRANK
          Stop...

          WHAM!

                         FRANK
          ...hitting me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          She swings but this time Frank lashes out.

          KUH-RACK!
          He punches her in the face. Hard. She drops to her hands
          and knees. When she looks up, her teeth are caked in blood.

                         FRANK
          You're insane, you know that? Look
          what you made me do!
          She staggers to her feet, sways before him.

                         FRANK
          Come on, I'll get you some ice--
          She SPITS blood in his face and SWINGS!
          He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with the force of
          thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful
          she'll get up this time, then --

                         QUIET LAUGHTER
          Frank stares as Piper rolls over.

                         PIPER
          Frank. Sweetie. I'm gonna tell
          everybody what I caught you doing
          with my pink dildo.
          Her laughter becomes a hysterical fit.

                         FRANK
          That's it.
          He drops on top of her, his fingers curl into a fist.

                         FRANK
          You don't wanna fuck me? Fine.
          When I'm done nobody's gonna wanna
          fuck you. Ever.

                         PIPER
          Go to hell.
          Frank raises his fist into the air. Then...

          MILTON (O.S.)
          Hey.
          Frank looks up as a boot catches him under the chin, lifting
          him off Piper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          Piper stares through blurry eyes as Milton drops on top of
          Frank, pounding him with his fists.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:

          EXT. COLORADO PLAINS - DUSK

          The sun is a glow to the west. The horizon dances and
          shimmers. Then...is that...yes. Someone is out there.
          Walking toward us. As if they appeared within the heat.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          We start close to the ground. Dress shoes. Suit pants.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          The ACCOUNTANT. Least he sure as shit looks like an
          accountant in blue suit and purple power tie. Not especially
          large. Nice looking face. Something trustworthy about him.
          Friendly even.
          He loosens his tie, slips his jacket off and tosses it over
          his shoulder. There's a bounce in his step.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DUSK

          NormaJean looks up as the Accountant enters.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Have a seat sweetie. Mary there
          will be right with you.
          Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper's replacement. She stops in
          her tracks. Stares at the Accountant.
          He winks at her.
          A shiver runs through Mother Mary. She backs away then
          rushes from the diner.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Mary?!
          Fat Lou leans from the Kitchen window.

                         FAT LOU
          Where's she going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          The Accountant turns to Lou. Stares. Then --

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You. Fat fuck. Come here.
          Lou stares.

                         FAT LOU
          What did you call me?
          The Accountant smiles.
          Fat Lou vanishes from the window then BURSTS from the kitchen.

                         FAT LOU
          I said, what did you call--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --I called you âfat fuck' and we had
          better leave it at that unless you'd
          prefer I call you âdead fat fuck.'

                         FAT LOU
          Wha-what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. An old
          man. White hair. Five-eleven.
          The Accountant smells the air, embraces it.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He was here earlier. Traveling
          light. Likely on foot.

                         FAT LOU
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FAT LOU
          That's supposed to mean something
          to me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It will if I add you to the books.
          And if you don't tell me what I
          want to know...
          NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          The Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a
          step back.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You had something to say?

                         NORMAJEAN
          He was here. Earlier.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Yes. We've established that.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Terrible tipper.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm sure he was. Where did he go?
          She points.

                         NORMAJEAN
          That way. West. On foot.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT

          The GTO THUNDERS past.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Piper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat.
          She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly
          Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow,
          looks at the jacket covering her.
          Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky.
          Piper looks.
          The MOON hangs a few days from full.
          Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her,
          then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold.

                         MILTON
          Want me to roll the window up?

                         PIPER
          You didn't kill him did you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         MILTON
          No but he'll likely piss blood for
          a day or two.

                         PIPER
          Thanks for that.

                         MILTON
          Hungry?
          He gestures through the windshield as they pass a âWelcome to
          Utahâ sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead.

                         PIPER
          Utah?

                         MILTON
          You mentioned San Francisco.

                         PIPER
          Appreciate what you done for me
          back there but I ain't takin you
          all the way to--

                         MILTON
          --My business is in Nevada. Can
          you get me that far?

                         PIPER
          What business?

                         MILTON
          I'm looking for someone. You
          hungry or not?
          Piper considers for a moment, then--

                         PIPER
          Yeah. I could eat.

                         MILTON
          Name's Milton. You're Piper,
          right?

                         PIPER
          You try to kill me and dump me in
          the desert I'll cut your nuts off.

                         MILTON
          Fair enough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

          Pool tables, old pin ball machines and an odd mix of BIKERS,
          COWBOYS and the SLUTS who love them.
          Piper and Milton slide into a booth. Piper eyes a Latino
          BUSBOY, nice biceps, jeans too tight.
          ROY, a greasy fella in his fifties approaches, big happy
          looking fucker, owns the joint.

                         GREASY FELLA
          Greetings folks, welcome to the
          Bull by the Balls...
          He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape.

                         MILTON
          Roy.

                         ROY
          Milton?
          Roy doesn't even try to hide his dislike of Milton.

                         ROY
          Thought you were dead.

                         MILTON
          You hoped I was dead. Not the same.

                         ROY
          You planning on staying?
          Milton eyes a door marked âMotel Guestsâ.

                         MILTON
          Got a problem with that?

                         ROY
          Your money's good as any Iâspect.
          But be gone by dawn.
          With Roy turns his back on them and walks away.

                         PIPER
          What was that all about?

                         MILTON
          Back in another life I used to
          drive a truck through these parts.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         PIPER
          And you'd spend the night here?

                         MILTON
          I'd spend the night here fucking
          his wife.
          Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar.

                         PIPER
          What's wrong?

                         MILTON
          I...nothing I guess.
          A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her
          fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton.

                         CANDY
          Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you
          off with some drinks?

                         MILTON
          Beer.

                         PIPER
          Same.
          Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table.

                         CANDY
          And I'll need to see your IDs.
          Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins
          filling out the card.

                         MILTON
          What is this?

                         PIPER
          Guess it's been awhile since you
          drove that truck through here.

                         CANDY
          You want a drink? You gotta be a
          member. Dry county.

                         MILTON
          You're kidding.

                         CANDY
          Welcome to Utah, Mr...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          She takes his license.

                         MILTON
          Call me Milton.

                         CANDY
          This license isn't just expired.
          It's an antique.

                         MILTON
          Fine, then bring me a milk.
          She tosses his card on the table.

                         CANDY
          For you, gorgeous, we'll break the
          rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody.
          Milton watches her go. Drinking her up.

                         PIPER
          You gonna tap that?

                         MILTON
          Tap what?

                         PIPER
          Jeez, Milton, how long's it been?
          Sounds like you used to stick it in
          anything with a crack.

                         MILTON
          Yeah. Well. I've been distracted.

                         PIPER
          Suit yourself. But nobody reaches
          the end and says, âWish I hadn't
          fucked so much.â
          Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he
          needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles.
          Piper slides from the booth.

                         MILTON
          Where are you...?

                         PIPER
          I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot
          bath and sleep in a warm bed.

                         MILTON
          What about your beer?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         PIPER
          You drink it. See you at dawn.
          But she walks right passed the âMotel Guestsâ door and
          approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her.
          As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back
          of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good
          looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden
          beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye
          but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
          He glances at Milton then --

                         JONAH KING
          It's Roy isn't it?
          Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile.

                         ROY
          Sure is. Get you a drink friend?

                         JONAH KING
          Fantastic place you have here. You
          don't happen to rent it out for
          parties do you?

                         ROY
          We sure do. You planing a party?
          Again Jonah glances at Milton.

                         JONAH KING
          Oh yes. Tonight, in fact.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - NIGHT

          The Television chatters away with local nightly news. Frank
          ignores it, paces on the phone. As he does, we see Jonah
          King's face on the TV. The same guy from the bar. Archive
          footage of him preaching, warm, friendly.

                          FRANK
          I gotta go.
          Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find --
          The Accountant smiling at him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          There was an old man, yes?

                         FRANK
          Wha?
          The Accountant sniffs the air.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          White hair. Angry with attitude.

                         FRANK
          Sumbitch kicked me in the face.
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FRANK
          The wha? I called the cops, not a
          bean-counter?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          The old man? Where did he go?

                         FRANK
          Fuck should I know where he went?
          I woke up and all three were gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          All three?

                         FRANK
          The bitch, the old man and my car!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          You know what, fuck you. You ain't
          no cop. I'm done talking.
          Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant grabs his
          wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room!
          Frank doesn't stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the
          ground his toes drag the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite
          wall and bounces into the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You son of a --
          Frank staggers to his feet. Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He
          wipes blood onto the back of his hand.

                         FRANK
          You...you made me bleed.
          Frank pulls a baseball bat from behind the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You leave me no choice but to beat
          you with this Louisville Slugger.
          Frank takes a step, swings at the Accountant.
          The Accountant dodges.
          Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS & GLASS fly.
          The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.
          SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him
          backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs
          there until...
          The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather
          momentum.
          Frank can only watch as the Accountant -

          HURLS THE JAGGED TIP OF THE BAT RIGHT AT HIM --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          The tip STRIKES Frank in the shoulder with such force, it
          impales him up to the knob. Drives him backwards where it
          embeds into the wall!
          The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses
          it from hand to hand with a loud SLAP of flesh on wood.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          (dazed) I...what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Your car. What kind is it?
          Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.

                         FRANK
          Wha...what did you do?
          The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS
          out in pain.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Answer the question.

                         FRANK
          A â67 GTO! Arrgg!
          The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye
          a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.

                         FRANK
          Hey! Just hold on!
          The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.

          FRANK'S POV
          It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists
          his head...no good.
          The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS
          his head to the wall. The words Louisville Slugger just
          visible where Frank's face should be.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - NIGHT

          The Accountant exits as two STATE TROOPERS approach, their
          vehicle parked behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         TROOPER #1
          Frank Raimi?

                         TROOPER #2
          You called about a stolen car?
          The Accountant gestures over his shoulder.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In there.
          Trooper #1 moves toward the opened door. The Accountant
          steps in front of Trooper #2.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. Five-
          eleven. White hair. Driving a â67
          GTO. He's traveling with her.
          He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo.

                         TROOPER #2
          Excuse me?
          The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being
          worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the
          coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at
          it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it.
          Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room.

                         TROOPER #1
          Jesus.
          He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant.

                         TROOPER #1
          Keep your hands where I can see them!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers, this is your lucky day.
          Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin.
          ANGLE - High looking down on the trio as the coin spins right
          in front of us - we glimpse the ancient face in the worn
          silver - Roman maybe?

                         TROOPER #1
          Show us your hands, asshole.
          (to his partner)
          What's the matter with you?! Draw
          your weapon!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          Trooper #2 slowly reaches for his gun until...
          The Accountant snatches the coin from the sky, thrusts it at
          the two cops.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Here. Look at this.
          They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it.

                         TROOPER #1
          You're... you're a Fed?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In pursuit of a white haired man. John
          Milton. He's travelling with the girl
          in this picture.
          Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in
          his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon.

                         TROOPER #1
          But, that guy, in the room. He's -

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --Dead. Yes. I'd say it's
          unfortunate, but I'd be lying.
          World won't miss him. Look,
          troopers. I need your help with my
          pursuit of this fugitive. If we,
          we three, can apprehend him...you
          are ambitious, correct.

                         TROOPER #2
          I guess...

                         TROOPER #1
          Yes, we are...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Wasn't actually a question. I can
          tell you are. Success will mean
          promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee
          it. Now we are going to hunt this
          Milton, we are going to find the
          GTO he's driving and when we find
          him, you will shoot to kill. You
          understand? Shoot. To. Kill.
          The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive.
          Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         TROOPER #1
          That's against protocol...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          This man is highly dangerous. He
          has killed and will kill again. He
          must be taken down on sight. The
          time it takes you to follow your
          protocols is the time it takes him
          to end your life.
          The Accountant crosses to the cruiser's back door, the coin
          disappearing back into his pocket.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Shall we?

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - NIGHT

          We're staring into two motel rooms. We're cheating...the
          wall that divides the rooms...divides the screen. The beds
          in each room butted up against the dividing wall.
          On one side we see Piper, on her back. Still clothed. At
          her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy.
          He's painting her toenails.
          On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding
          him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER.
          The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then...

                         BUSBOY
          Uh, are we gonna do it?

                         PIPER
          Well, I don't know, baby. Depends
          on how well you do those nails.
          Now pay attention. You might need
          to redo that one.
          He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her
          hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are
          starting to annoy the fuck out of her.
          She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall.

                         PIPER
          Shut the fuck up in there!
          Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         MILTON
          You shut the fuck up!
          That's it!
          Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared
          and topples backwards to the floor.

                         PIPER
          (giggles) Oh! Sorry, I didn't
          mean...
          She stops. Stares.
          Movement. Someone stepped quickly away from the window.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

          Piper BURSTS into the room ready to kick ass and take names.
          But...the place is...empty. Food still on the plates. Beer
          in the mugs. The TV over the bar is still on.
          We see footage of a Nevada Amber Alert. âBaby Tabitha still
          missingâ A photo of a baby in pink onesie. Then appearing
          beside it...the photo of Jonah King.

                         TV NEWS
          ...issued an all points bulletin for
          Jonah King's immediate detention in
          connection with the murder of a young
          married couple in Loveland, Colorado.
          Their infant girl is believed to have
          been abducted by this religious sect.
          A nation-wide Amber Alert is now in
          full effect.
          Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the bar.
          What the fuck?
          She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of athletic
          equipment hangs from the wall.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACKLOT - NIGHT

          Piper exits with a hockey stick.
          A few cars are left in the lot. A black Chevy van with flames
          stands out, parked in front of a barn/storage building.
          Piper crosses to a window in the bar/motel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         THROUGH WINDOW
          Busboy sits on Piper's bed. Still naked. He holds her nail
          polish to his nose. Sniffs. Jerks his head back.

                         PIPER
          Imbecile.

                         A NOISE
          Piper spins, grips the hockey stick.
          No one. The cars are empty. The barn looks undistur...
          A light GLOWS within the barn, bleeding through the wood
          slats. Then...
          CRREEEEEEEK...barn door slowly swings open.
          ...revealing THREE SILHOUETTES backlit by a hanging lamp.
          One holds a shovel. The other heaves an ax over his
          shoulder. The third holds a shotgun.
          The side door on the flamed van slides open. TWO SILHOUETTES
          step out. Baseball bat and machete.

                         FOOTSTEPS
          Piper spins as THREE DARK FIGURES appear around the side of
          the bar/motel. Sledge hammer, iron pipe, sickle.
          Surrounded. All seven begin walking toward her.
          Piper rushes back inside.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - NIGHT

          Still empty. Piper turns toward the door marked âMotel
          Guestsâ then hesitates.
          Instead she dives under a booth table...as...
          The back door opens.

          PIPER'S POV
          LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers. Work boots. Cowboy
          boots with a duct tape patch.
          A door opens. Piper sucks in breath. More legs appear.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          Shadows approach the desk counter near the âMotel Guestsâ
          door. There's an open guest book on the counter top.

          CLOSE ON GUEST BOOK
          As a weathered hand comes into view. A finger traces down to
          the last two entries.
          Piper Lee RM 111
          John Milton RM 112

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - MILTON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Candy's still on top. She is, as we say in the fuck
          industry, âcloseâ.

                         CANDY
          Close'm'close'm'close'm'close.
          Suddenly Milton's head jerks toward the door.
          His hand shoots beneath his pillow as--
          The door BURSTS OPEN!
          MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room.
          Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!

          KAFOOM!
          IRON PIPE is BLOWN backwards into MAN WITH MACHETE!
          Milton thrusts upright, suddenly Candy finds herself beneath
          him as --
          Machete HEAVES Iron Pipe to the side and rushes toward Milton
          as -- KAFOOM! He's blown off his feet!

          KER-SMASH!
          The window shatters as a MAN WITH BASEBALL BAT dives, hits,
          rolls and comes up swinging!
          Milton snakes an arm beneath Candy and rolls from the bed
          with her! As they fall--
          The bat SLAMS onto the mattress just missing them as --

          KA-BOOM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Milton turns Baseball Bat's head into a canoe!
          Milton on bottom again as they crash to the floor, still
          intertwined.

          FWOOM!
          The door adjoining Milton and Piper's room EXPLODES open at
          his feet!
          MAN WITH AXE and MAN WITH SHOTGUN enter!
          Milton, presses Candy's face into his chest, twisting his
          body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice!
          Shotgun's eye vaporizes in a mist! He drops to his knees.
          Man with Axe clutches his throat...blood gushing...turns and
          flees back into the adjoining room as --

          KUH-FWAM!
          The bathroom door flies open!

          MILTON'S POV
          Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots with duct tape patch
          appears.
          Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls
          Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor.
          COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see
          Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed.

          COWBOY WITH SLEDGE
          Old Man. You know you can't stop
          what's comin' That little girl's
          as good as dead.
          TWO BULLETS slide into the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut.
          Milton aims under the bed. FIRES!
          Half the man's foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes
          to the floor!
          He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond
          before Sledge Hammer's forehead implodes.

                         A NOISE
          Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just
          in time to see--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          MAN WITH SICKLE enter!
          He stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at Milton.
          The glare becomes fear.
          Milton's already aiming the 357, then --

          CLICK. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK
          Sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and--

          KUR-RUNCH!
          The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a hockey stick crashes
          down from above and behind.
          Sickle drops to the floor revealing Piper, white knuckling
          the hockey stick...her face pale.

                         MILTON
          Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad.
          Milton stares down into Candy's face.
          Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and
          opens her eyes.

                         CANDY
          Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck
          I've ever had.
          Piper crosses to the adjoining room.

                         CANDY
          Hello? Do you mind?! We're...
          Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She
          SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room.

          PIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM
          Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But
          it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood
          drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming.

                         PIPER
          Aw, hell.
          Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with
          Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357.

                         MILTON
          I definitely got their attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         PIPER
          What. The fuck? You know these people?
          Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder.

                         MILTON
          Come on. There are probably more.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - FRONT - NIGHT

          Jonah King slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked
          Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses
          toward the Driver's side door...
          The gym bag starts to CRY.

                         JONAH KING
          Shhhh. Don't cry little precious.
          FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut.
          Jonah King turns, freezes.
          Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser,
          staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag.
          For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career
          maker. News. Media. Leno. Then--
          The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He
          ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers. Remember why we're here.
          He walks by them towards the front door of the bar.
          Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building.
          Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at
          the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the
          gym bag, engine ROARS to life.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACK LOT - NIGHT

          Milton and Piper exit into the back lot.

                         PIPER
          Milton, I'm serious! I want some
          answers!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          They turn as the SPEEDING Sedan tears onto the highway. As
          it disappears behind the barn it reveals --
          --Man With Shovel. He FLINGS the barn doors open, stares at
          Milton and Piper for a moment then vanishes within.

                         MILTON
          Yeah, we both want some answers.
          Milton moves toward the barn as--
          The State Troopers walk around the bar.
          Everyone freezes.
          The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper.
          Recognition.

                         MILTON
          Aw fuck.
          Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the
          Troopers as they go for their guns.

                         MILTON
          Come on!
          Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire!
          The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and
          shoot back!

          FFFUMP!
          Milton staggers, clutches his side. A crimson spot spreads
          across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles,
          falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes
          spilling from within.

                         PIPER
          No!
          The Troopers keep FIRING!
          Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun
          lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter.
          We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any
          old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the
          metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry.
          She reaches for it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         MILTON
          No! Not that one.
          He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without
          hesitation, rises and --

          KUPOW!
          Trooper #1's chest EXPLODES. The force spins him...still
          firing...he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear!
          Both men crash to the ground. Dead.

          KAFOOM!
          The barn doors explode outward as a big Dodge truck powers
          toward the highway, Man with Shovel behind the wheel.
          Piper turns to find Milton struggling toward the GTO.

                         PIPER
          What are you doing?!

                         MILTON
          Have to stop him...

                         PIPER
          Milton! Those cops weren't trying
          to arrest us!

                         MILTON
          No. They weren't. Get in.
          Milton climbs behind the GTO's wheel.

                         PIPER
          I'll drive.

                         MILTON
          You gotta patch me up. I'll drive.
          Piper fumes but climbs into the passengers seat.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          The car RUMBLES to life!

                         PIPER
          They were trying to kill us!

                         MILTON
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         PIPER
          They were trying to kill you.

                         MILTON
          Yes.
          Milton floors it! As the GTO fishtails toward the highway--

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The Accountant steps from the back door of the bar.
          Hunter and Hunted glare.

                         MILTON
          Christ.
          Piper's attention is still on the dead cops.

                         PIPER
          Christ is right! They start
          shooting with no warning?! What
          are you, a murderer? You escape
          from prison or something?
          The GTO tears onto the highway!

          IN REARVIEW MIRROR
          The Accountant just stands there...fading into the darkness.

                         PIPER
          Well?! Which is it?!

                         MILTON
          Both.
          Piper raises the gun, points it at Milton.

                         PIPER
          What have you gotten me into? I
          should...I should...Jesus, I just
          killed a cop! I'm going to prison.
          Give me one good reason I shouldn't
          shoot you in the face.

                         MILTON
          Because I'm driving.

                         PIPER
          You know what I mean!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Milton gestures through the windshield, toward the distant
          brake lights ahead.

                         MILTON
          They took my grand-baby. Took my
          grand-baby and killed my...
          He breaks off. Looks away.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          We see the lighted Amber Alert sign come into view and
          quickly blur passed.
          Piper stares at Milton.

                         PIPER
          The little girl on the news? The
          baby girl they're looking for?
          Milton nods.

                         PIPER
          But the news said the baby's
          parents were...
          Piper stops.
          Milton's eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.

                         MILTON
          Sons of bitches killed my daughter.
          Piper stares. Milton steadies himself.

                         MILTON
          So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm
          gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm
          gonna get her back and I'm gonna
          kill every last one of the fuckers.

                         (A BEAT)
          You want out, I'll understand.
          Piper considers, then --

          KUH-FWAM!
          They both slam into their seats as the GTO is rear-ended.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          EXT. GTO - NIGHT

          It's the Trooper's cruiser. The Accountant, face blank, sits
          behind the wheel.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He
          mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin!

                         MILTON
          In the back seat. Now.

                         PIPER
          What? Why?

                         MILTON
          Now!
          Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the
          cruiser pull up along side him.

                         MILTON
          Shotgun. It's already loaded.
          Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the
          front seat.

                         MILTON
          Have the other one ready. Not the
          357. The OLD one.

          THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW
          The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a
          beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton.
          Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel
          through the passenger window.

          BOOOM!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The cruiser's driver's side window explodes.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT


          MILTON'S POV

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          The Accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder.
          When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A
          cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser
          next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It's over, Milton. Stop the car.

                         MILTON
          I can't do that.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Really? What makes you think you
          have a choice?

                         MILTON
          I got something I gotta do first.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Then you should have done it a long
          time ago.

                         MILTON
          I didn't have to do it a long time ago!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Milton, I will kill that nice woman
          in the backseat to get to you.

                         MILTON
          I won't let you do that.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Again. What makes you think you
          have a choice?

                         MILTON

                         (TO PIPER)
          Now.
          Piper hands Milton the ancient Six Shooter. Milton snatches
          it, points it across the gap between cars, pulls back the
          hammer with a thunderous...KUH-THUNK.

                         MILTON
          This does.
          The Accountant's eyes widen.

          SSHHU-BOOOM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          It's as if God tripped, fell and the entire earth shook as a
          result!
          The recoil nearly rips Milton's arm off.
          We travel with the slug, fire trailing it, as it SLOMOs
          toward the Accountant...his eyes continuing to widen...the
          muscles in his face contracting.

          INT. CRUISER - NIGHT

          The Accountant cuts the wheel. Hard.
          He wracks his head around as the slug just kisses his cheek.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The Cruiser SLAMS into the guard rail! The back-end rockets
          forward as the cruiser goes into a spin.
          The GTO fishtails away.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton fights with the wheel as --

          IN REARVIEW MIRROR
          The Cruiser bucks up and over the guard rail.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The Cruiser, spins like a top, helicopters out over the
          nothingness and plummets to the dry valley below.

          KER-FRUNCH!
          And flattens sending out a dusty shockwave in all directions.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton manages to stop the GTO before it slams into the rail.
          The GTO BUCKS and STALLS.
          He breathes a sigh, then turns and stares in the direction
          they'd been going.
          He can just make out the fleeing Cultist's tail lights.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          The back door opens. Piper leaps out.

                         MILTON
          Piper! Wait!
          Milton watches the taillights vanish over a distant ridge.
          He starts the engine...then hesitates...

          THROUGH BACK WINDOW
          Piper approaches the destroyed guard rail.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          Piper stares into the valley below.

                         HER POV
          We can just make out the flattened Cruiser in the light of
          the three quarter moon. No fireball. No smoke. No sign of
          movement. Just flattened metal.

                         PIPER
          He's not one of the ones who took
          your granddaughter, is he?

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          Milton stands behind her. Shakes his head.

                         MILTON
          Someone else.

                         PIPER
          Is there anyone not trying to kill you?
          Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then --

                         PIPER
          Come on. I'll help you. But
          we're dealing with that first?
          She points to his blood soaked shirt.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT

          The GTO THUNDERS beneath a starry sky.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER
          The needle hovers at 95 mph.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach
          wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads.

                         MILTON
          My daughter got mixed up with the son
          of a bitch right out of college.

                         PIPER
          She knew him? She knew Jonah King,
          the man they think killed...
          She stops herself.

                         MILTON
          She knew him. The world was in a
          fuckin tailspin and King was
          preaching quiet revolution.
          He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357.

                         MILTON
          It was four months before she
          realized âquiet' meant hiding in
          the basement, cutting the heads off
          chickens.

                         PIPER
          Jonah King was into voodoo?
          Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically.

                         MILTON
          Voodoo, the occult, not much he
          wasn't into. When she told him she
          was leaving, he helped her pack.
          Gassed up her car. Cooked her a
          hot meal. Then while she slept he
          broke her leg in three places with
          a tire iron.

                         PIPER
          Jesus.
          She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         MILTON
          She learned her lessen. Was a good
          little follower for eighteen
          months. That's when they met with
          some witch doctor bullshit artist
          in Chinatown. It was Chinese New
          Year so the place was wall to wall
          slants. She saw her chance,
          stabbed Jonah in the face with a
          souvenir corkscrew and vanished
          into the crowd.

                         PIPER
          Milton. Your daughter was in a
          cult for two years and you didn't
          know? Why didn't you help her?
          Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight.
          His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The
          gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber.

                         MILTON
          I didn't find out about any of this
          until...until I got locked up.
          Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut.
          Shoves it into his duffle.

                         PIPER
          Not gonna reload?

                         MILTON
          Only had three bullets to begin...

                         PIPER
          Milton.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an
          accident.
          Milton eases the shotgun into his lap.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Several vehicles and an RV block the road. The PASSENGERS
          scramble back and forth. There's a jack-knifed flatbed, a
          crumpled Station Wagon and the Cultist's Dodge truck is
          overturned on the shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          INT. GTO - DAWN


                         PIPER
          That's his truck.

                         MILTON
          Stay put. I won't be long.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Milton climbs from the GTO and crosses toward the overturned
          Dodge. He lets the shotgun dangle at his side, keeping it
          hidden behind him.
          TATTOOED GUY and SKANKY GAL stand near the RV with MAN IN
          LEATHER JACKET. BUSINESS WOMAN paces on her cell phone.
          Milton glances at MAN WITH WIG sitting in the driver's seat
          of his station wagon, his face in his hands. LADY IN
          LEOPARDSKIN HOTPANTS kneels beside him. In the passenger
          seat, BURLY DUDE's on his phone. Watching Milton.
          There's a couple near the overturned Dodge. TRUCK DRIVING
          WOMAN gazes into the upsidedown cab. THIN OLD MAN rises and
          nods as Milton approaches.

          THIN OLD MAN
          I think he's gonna be okay.

                         MILTON
          Is that right?
          In a swift move, Milton RATCHETS a shell into the chamber,
          drops to one knee, aims into the cab.

          MILTON'S POV
          The cab is empty.
          Somewhere near, we hear a MUFFLED BABY'S CRY.

          CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
          Realization. Shit. But it's too late.
          A snub-nosed .38 appears at his temple.

          THIN OLD MAN
          I wouldn't.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          PIPER (O.S.)
          Milton!
          Milton rises slowly and takes in the situation.
          Tattooed Guy comes up fast behind the GTO. We get a good
          look at him. It's Man with Shovel. Piper's getting out,
          doesn't see Tattooed Guy until he's grabbed her. Presses the
          pistol in her ribs.

                         PIPER
          Hey! Let me go, fucker!
          She goes to fight but Man in Leather Jacket approaches her
          with an axe. Burly Dude is with him.

                         MILTON
          Don't Piper! (to Thin Old Man)
          Let her go. She's a pain in the
          ass you don't want.
          Milton still hasn't let go of his shotgun.

          THIN OLD MAN
          Drop it. Or we'll gut her.
          To emphasize the point, Truck Driving Woman pulls a Rambo
          Knife from her purse and smiles a missing toothed smile.
          Milton drops the shotgun as --
          --Man With Wig steps from his car with a scoped hunting
          rifle. Lady in Leopardskin rises revealing a baseball bat
          with nails and spikes protruding from the end.
          Skanky Gal and Business Woman open the RV's door.
          Jonah King steps from within then smiles down at Milton. He
          cradles a baby in his arms.

                         JONAH KING
          Milton, isn't it? Why are you here?
          Why are you making such a fuss?

                         MILTON
          Isn't that obvious, you sick fuck?
          I'm here for her.
          Milton gestures toward the baby.

                         JONAH KING
          What's obvious is that you clearly
          abandoned your daughter.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          JONAH KING (cont'd)
          Crushed her so completely that she
          told everyone you were dead. No,
          Milton, I cannot in good faith hand
          over this child to you.

                         MILTON
          But sacrificing her under the full
          fuckin moon, that's okay?

                         JONAH KING
          Okay? Milton, your granddaughter is
          unbelievably blessed. Look around.
          The world's on fire. Companies own
          our governments and the people
          suffer. Daily. And will continue to
          suffer until change comes. And
          change will come. Thanks to your
          granddaughter, Milton. She will open
          the door to a new world order.

                         MILTON
          Your BS don't work on me. You
          killed my daughter but I won't let
          you kill my grandbaby.

                         JONAH KING
          Your daughter's death was an
          accident.

                         MILTON
          No shithead, it wasn't. I saw the
          whole damn thing. I saw who you
          are when no one's lookin'. And I
          saw what that night cost ya.
          Jonah's armor cracks a little as Milton faces the others.

                         JONAH KING
          Milton, you're embarrassing your--

                         MILTON
          (to the crowd)
          --What was it three or four days
          before he showed after killin my
          little girl? You jerkoffs didn't
          notice he was walking a little stiff?
          Milton glances at Skanky Gal and Business Woman.

                         MILTON
          When's the last time he shared a
          bed with either of you? Before
          that night, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          The girls shoot a nervous glance at Jonah.

                         MILTON
          You forced my daughter onto her
          knees, you sonofabitch. And she made
          you pay for it.
          Jonah stares at Milton in shock. How does he know?

                         MILTON
          But don't take my word for it. Ask
          him. Leather Jacket was there.
          Jonah made him swear not to tell.
          Jonah lifts a .38 auto from within the baby's blanket and
          shoots Leather Jacket in the forehead.
          Piper SCREAMS. The Baby starts CRYING.
          Jonah shoves the baby into Skanky Gal's arms then swings the
          gun toward Milton.

                         JONAH KING
          Put the blonde in the RV.
          Tattooed Guy shoves Piper toward the RV as Skanky and
          Business woman climb in with the baby.
          Jonah aims the gun at Milton's face.

                         MILTON
          I'm only gonna make this offer
          once. Give me my granddaughter and
          I'll let you liv--

          KAPOW!
          He shoots Milton in the left eye! Milton's head snaps, he
          falls to the ground on his back.

                         PIPER
          No!!!
          Tattooed Guy shoves Piper into the RV.

          INT. RV - DAWN

          Skanky tries to calm the crying baby. Tattoo shoves Piper
          onto the travel couch then hands the gun to Business Woman.

                         BUSINESS WOMAN
          Please. Try something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          Jonah climbs into the RV, closes the door.

                         JONAH KING
          Let's go.

                         PIPER
          You killed him! You bastard you --

          WHACK!
          Piper's head rocks back as Business Woman pistol whips her.

                         BUSINESS WOMAN
          Next time I shoot that mouth right
          off your face.
          Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper's SOBS
          rising behind him.

          JONAH'S POV
          Milton's body lays there. Unmoving. His one eye staring
          skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the
          cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Man With Wig pops the back of the Station wagon. Truck
          Driving Woman and Thin Old Man lean in, snatch two shovels.
          Burly Dude drags Leather Jacket's body next to Milton's as
          the others join him.
          They gaze down at Milton, his one eye open and unseeing. A
          single tear runs from it. The other, pools blood where the
          bullet entered.

          MILTON'S GOOD EYE TWITCHES.
          Everyone stares. Did they just see that right?

          THE 357 COMES UP IN MILTON'S HAND - FIRES!
          The bullet RIPS BURLY'S SCALP WIDE. He stumbles back.
          The others recoil.
          Burly ROARS, blood streaming from his head wound - charges
          Milton with the ax.
          MILTON unleashes rapid fire lead from the 357!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Burly's blown back! The others scatter as Milton staggers to
          his feet! He grabs the shotgun, leans on it for support.

                         ON GTO
          AS Milton stumbles to the open passenger door.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of the Station Wagon with
          the scoped hunting rifle. Aims.
          BLAM - His shot rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off.
          Milton FIRES back with the shotgun - forcing Man with Wig
          back behind the wagon.

          INT. GTO - DAWN

          Milton falls heavily across the front seats. Ties Piper's
          bandanna around his head, covers his now gaping eye.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE

          Man with Wig hasn't had enough yet. He aims the rifle.
          Moves into the road. Can't see Milton in the car, but that
          doesn't matter. He knows he's there.

          BLAM.

          INT. GTO - DAWN

          The windshield SHATTERS. Glass splinters down on Milton. He
          reaches for the keys.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          The Cultists jump at the sound of the GTO's GLASS PACKS!
          Dust rips skyward as the GTO barrels toward them!
          They scramble, clawing at one another to get out of the way.
          All except Man With Wig. He's playin' hero, lines Milton in
          his sights. But what he sees shakes him to his core.

          POV THRU SCOPE
          MILTON, face bloody and twisted with rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Man with Wig screams, falls, tries to roll out of the way.

          FU-FUMP!
          The wheels pound over both of his legs, SHATTERING them!

          INT. GTO - DRIVING - DAY

          Milton flips open the 357 as he FISHTAILS the GTO back onto
          the highway. He dangles the 357 out the window.

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          Empty shells DANCE onto the blacktop, several SKITTER down
          onto the cracked Earth and OS.
          ANGLE - moving fast, the GTO's wheels consume the frame.

                         MATCHING TO:
          A bicycle tire SKIDS to a stop before us. Then a second.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          EXT. VALLEY FLOOR - DAY

          Two TEENAGERS sit on beat-to-shit mountain bikes, staring.

                         THEIR POV
          The cratered cruiser lies on its crushed roof, both doors
          shut. No windows visible.
          TEEN #1 lights a chillum pipe, inhales. Holds it, passes the
          pipe, then speaks as only a pothead can.

                         TEEN #1
          Think anyone's in there?

                         TEEN #2
          (inhales, holds, passes)
          I guess. Doors is still closed.

                         TEEN #1
          (inhales, holds)
          Bet it's sick. Wanna look?

          KWU-FOOM!
          The driver's side door launches right at us!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          ...nails Teen #2 in the chest, knocking him ten feet
          backwards where he skids on his back.

                         TEEN #1
          Jesus!
          The Accountant rolls from the cruiser, stands, brushes
          himself off as he strides forward.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Carpenter and despite what you've
          heard, prefers short hair.
          Teen #2 sits up suddenly, coughing.

                         TEEN #2
          You...you nearly killed me!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Not even close. I won't see you
          again until...
          He tilts his head, as if reading a sign too far away.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          ...until you're seventy-three.
          He glances at Teen #1, then --

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You, I'll see in three months.
          And with that the Accountant turns and strides away.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - MOVING - DAY

          The RV RUMBLES past, running faster than an RV should.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah glances through the back window. Double takes.

                         HIS POV
          A rapidly growing black blotch on the road. In seconds that
          blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway,
          gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When
          Jonah speaks...it is with wonder.

                         JONAH KING
          Look at this. He's still coming.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         TATTOO
          Who's still coming?

                         JONAH KING
          The old man. He's alive.

          TATTOO AND PIPER
          What?
          Piper tries to stand. Business Woman backhands her!

                         BUSINESS WOMAM
          Stay down! That's impossible!

                         TATTOO
          You shot him in the face! He can't--

                         JONAH KING
          Don't you see? We stand at the
          crossroads! Did you think we would
          just idly change the world? The
          forces of evil challenge us! This is
          wonderful! We show ourselves to be
          worthy. I'm so very proud of each
          one of you.
          Tattoo and Business Woman beam.
          Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby's face. The
          kid goes quiet as --
          The back glass SHATTERS.
          Everyone ducks!

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          Milton leans out the driver's side with the shotgun in his
          left hand, his one good eye squinting as --

          KAFOOM!
          He fires at the RV!
          He RATCHETS another shell into the chamber, takes aim
          then...hesitates...

                         IN REARVIEW
          The front end of a fast approaching vehicle!

          WHAM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          Milton's head snaps back as a 90 Corvette slams into the back
          of the GTO.

          EXT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin behind the wheel, her eyes insane.
          Behind the Corvette we see a â92 Lincoln, Thin Old Man
          driving. Truck Driving Woman in a â95 Viper.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton struggles to pull the shotgun back inside...struggles
          to keep the big GTO on the road.
          Distracted by the newcomers...we see what Milton does not.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The RV pulls off the road to the left.
          Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off.

                         MILTON
          Shit!
          He SLAMS on his brakes.

          INT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY

          Leopardskin's eyes go wide. Survival kicks in. She jerks
          the wheel.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - THE CHASE - DAY

          The Corvette slams into the side of the Viper!
          The Lincoln cuts hard right.
          All three cars shoot pass the GTO.
          Milton cuts the wheel left and floors it!

          INT. RV - DAY

          Piper watches as the bucking RV forces Jonah and Business
          Woman to turn their backs on her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Piper leaps from the couch, rushes up behind and shoves them
          toward the shattered back window!
          Jonah snatches a cabinet, drops his gun!
          It slides beneath the foldout bed.
          But Business Woman hits the giant opening and flips up and
          out of the RV!

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton looks up as Business Woman SLAMS into the ground and
          TUMBLES just out of his path. She sits up...dazed. Alive.
          Milton swerves...just enough...to...

          KAFWAM!
          What doesn't explode from the force KUH-THUMPS as the GTO
          bucks over her body.
          Milton grits through the pain. A bloody angry smile.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah stares out the back glass in shock.

                         PIPER
          Oops.

                         JONAH KING
          I am patient and forgiving, but
          that was wrong of you.
          He turns to her.

                         JONAH KING
          I'm going to kill you now. And
          then I'm going to rape your corpse.
          So that in the afterlife you might
          consider your sin this day.
          Piper CRACKS her knuckles.

                         PIPER
          Great. Between now and then.
          I'm'a fuck you up.
          He takes a step and swings a punch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          But she leaps at his face, closing the gap too quickly. Her
          French Manicure digs in. Jonah screams. They both go down!
          The baby WAILS.
          Skanky crawls into the cramped sleeper-bunk above the driver.
          Pulls the baby with her, tucks back into the corner, away
          from the battle in the RV's cabin.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton is gaining when --

          BOOM!
          The back glass SHATTERS.

          EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY

          Truck Driving Woman gains on Milton in her Viper. She's
          being blanketed in dust. BOOM! She fires a .44 Magnum.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          The radio and dash explode!

                         MILTON
          Son of a bitch.
          Milton snatches the 357, points it out the back glass and
          opens fire.

          BOOM!
          Milton's POV
          A white dot spider webs the Viper's windshield left.

          BOOM!
          Windshield middle!

          BOOM!
          The windshield suddenly turns red from the inside as a dot
          appears in front of the driver.
          The Viper jerks right drifts off of the dirt path!

                         FOOM

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          The Lincoln bursts through the dust cloud behind it. Thin
          Old Man leans from the driver's window, FIRES.
          Slugs PEPPER the GTO.
          Milton spins in his seat.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The RV has pulled ahead and vanishes over a hilltop.
          Milton FLOORS it!

          INT. RV - DAY

          Piper on top, Jonah's face looks like he ran into a barbed
          wire fence! He howls in pain and manages to slip a hand
          around her throat!
          Piper feels it. His fingers tighten. He shoves her away
          from him...she can no longer dig into his face.
          Her arms flail. Reaching for anything. Grasping.
          Her face turns red. Eyes bulge. Fuck.
          She claws his shirt open.
          And there...hanging around his neck is a small corkscrew.
          Chinese in design.
          She snatches it and --

          SHUNK!
          Stabs it into Jonah's shoulder, twists it deeper in.
          He SCREAMS. Releasing her!

          EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY

          Quiet.

          FOOM!
          GTO rockets over the hill top, clears the ground ten feet!
          The moment the GTO touches down, Milton BRAKES!
          Milton JOLTS the car into reverse! Tires SCREAM in protest!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          The GTO jerks backwards...climbing toward the top of the hill
          in reverse when Milton SNAPS the wheel.
          The GTO 180s, comes to rest just on this side of the hilltop.
          Milton casually leans out of the driver's side window with
          the shotgun in hand. He points it skyward as--

          FOOM!
          The Lincoln ROCKETS over the hilltop...and passes directly
          over the top of Milton.
          Milton's one good eye zeroes in on the massive gas tank
          beneath the back of the car.
          Milton squeezes the trigger.
          The back end of the Lincoln EXPLODES as --
          --The Corvette rockets over the hilltop!

          INT. CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin's face drops.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into the ground before her!
          Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as --

          EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY


          KER-FWAM!
          She slams into the burning vehicle and spins out of control!

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton kicks the car into drive, jerks a 180 and speeds off
          toward the RV.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah sits up...he pulls at the corkscrew and screams. It
          won't budge.
          He glares at Piper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.
          She scans for a weapon. Nothing. She snatches an umbrella
          from a coat rack. It'll have to do...
          There's a machete hanging beneath it.
          She drops the umbrella grabs the machete. Smiles at Jonah.

                         PIPER
          Give me the baby and I'll make the
          pain go away.
          Suddenly everyone SLAMS into the side of the RV!

          Piper clings to the old stove. She watches in horror as --
          Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed. It slides
          right up to him.
          He snatches it.
          Piper leaps through the door.

          EXT. RV - DAY

          Piper SLAMS into the side of the RV. She tries desperately

          Jonah leans through the door. Gun in hand.

                         JONAH KING
          Goodbye, child.

          MILTON (O.S.)

          Jonah looks up. Milton is driving beside them, shotgun in

          KUH-FWAM!
          But before Milton can get his shot off --
          The Corvette SLAMS into the back of the GTO!
          Milton fires! Blowing a hole in the side of the RV a foot to
          the right of Jonah's head!
          Jonah leaps back inside the RV.
          Piper clings on for dear life but she's slipping.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton jerks the wheel.

          INT. CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin slows as Milton's GTO goes into a spin.
          There's a smile on her face. She thinks he's lost control!
          Until the GTO does a 180. Milton now driving in reverse.
          His shotgun pointing through the remnants of windshield...
          ...directly at Lady in Leopardskin.

          BOOM!
          Her head goes buh-bye.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The Corvette swerves off of the road, jumps a ditch and flips
          thirty or forty times.

          EXT. RV - DAY

          Piper slips. Slips again. It's over. She knows it. Damn.
          She falls.

          FUMP.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          And lands on the hood of the GTO.

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          She looks up, through the GTO's windshield into Milton's
          battered face. He stretches his hand out to her. Piper
          snags it before slipping off into oblivion.

                         MILTON
          Got ya.
          Piper nods, crawls toward the windshield, Milton tries to
          pull her in as --

          KUH-THUNK....CRUNCHCHCHCH...
          A horrible sound of grinding metal roars from beneath the
          GTO's hood.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The GTO pulls to the side of the road.
          Milton leaps out and stares.
          He can just make out Jonah standing in the back window...
          holding his granddaughter.
          Piper eases from the hood.
          She stares at her bandanna, at the blood on his face.

                         PIPER
          Jesus, Milton. How?
          She pulls him close...looks at the back of his head.

                         MILTON
          It's still in there. The bullet. I
          can feel it.

                         PIPER
          But how...how are you still alive?
          He stares back toward the RV. Just a dot on the horizon now.

                         MILTON
          Ain't got time to die.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         PIPER
          I tried, Milton. I tried to get
          her back.

                         MILTON
          I know, baby. I know. Jonah only
          had about twenty followers. We
          hurt him good today.

                         PIPER
          Fuckin devil worshipers freak me
          out. They mess with powers that
          should be left alone. Turns my
          shit white.

                         MILTON
          Powers. It's all bullshit.

                         PIPER
          No, Milton. It's real. Ghosts,
          UFOs, bigfoot, that's the bullshit.
          The Devil and demons? Once those
          doors are opened you're fucked.
          Milton rolls his one good eye.
          Piper turns back to the GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine.

                         PIPER
          What do we do now?

                         MILTON
          I used to know a guy lived out this
          way. You got one of them portable
          phones?

                         PIPER
          Portable phones? You mean a cell
          phone? Yeah, in my bag.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAY


          WE ARE CLOSE ON THE CRACKED EARTH
          As a hand slams into view, fingers with dirt crusted nails
          curl...dig into the ground.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Man With Wig crawls toward us. He's pale. Eyes dim.

          PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          His busted, mangled legs have left a slug trail of blood and
          fluid stretching back to the highway.
          Left hand hits the ground, right hand digs into the dirt. He
          drags himself forward a few inches.

                         HIS POV
          He's crawling toward the Station Wagon.
          Someone...somewhere...is HUMMING
          Wig turns, squints.

          A SILHOUETTE APPROACHES
          Back lit by the early day sun. There's a bounce in his step.
          Wig holds his hand out to the savior as--
          The Accountant's smiling face becomes clear.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Scorcher today, huh?
          He takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle.

          MAN WITH WIG
          Help me...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Christ on a cracker. My apologies.
          The Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into
          the shade of the Station Wagon where he flips him around into
          a sitting position.
          Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above
          his left breast.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What's that supposed to mean?

          MAN WITH WIG
          It's a symbol of our pact with Lord
          Satan.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Pact huh? That's cute. Funny he's
          never mentioned you.
          Wig stares down at his mangled legs. The Accountant notices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Yeah, those are fucked. Here, have
          some water.
          Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Milton's work I take it?

          MAN WITH WIG
          Ran me over with his...how do
          you...? Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant. I'm curious.
          And I never get curious. What do
          you people want with Milton?

          MAN WITH WIG
          You're the who?
          The Accountant smiles, places his hand around Wig's clearly
          shattered femur and squeezes.
          Wig's body convulses! He SCREAMS.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Does it matter? Milton. Why is he
          important to you?

          MAN WITH WIG
          He isn't! He's the one chasing us!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Why?
          Wig stares...searches for an answer.
          The Accountant snatches a mangled ankle and twists. Wig's
          body stiffens and he SCREAMS.

          MAN WITH WIG
          Because! Because of what we did.
          Because of who we took.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Color me curious. What DID you do
          and who DID you take?

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DEAD GTO - DAY


                         CLOSE ON

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          The blood stained pink bandanna. The wind pushes it gently
          down the black asphalt.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Milton sits on the GTO's hood. Piper stands between his legs
          cleaning his wound.

                         PIPER
          Lemme know if I hurt you.

                         MILTON
          Do what you gotta do. You get used
          to the pain.
          Piper pulls a black bandanna from her pack, there are white
          skulls on it. She folds it, ties it around Milton's head.

                         PIPER
          There. That's better.
          When she moves aside we see she's lined up a skull over his
          missing eye.

          A VEHICLE APPROACHES.
          Milton slides from the hood, steps protectively in front of
          Piper as a banged up wrecker pulls toward them, pulls to the
          side of the road.

          POV FROM APPROACHING VEHICLE
          From this angle it looks as though an innocent old man and
          his granddaughter are having car trouble.

          POV FROM BEHIND THE GTO
          From this angle we can see Milton concealing the shotgun
          behind him. Piper stands close, her hand on the handle of
          the 357 protruding from his waistband.

                         ON WRECKER
          As the DRIVER steps out...stands half hidden by the door as

                         WE --

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          Like Piper, the Driver has his right hand tucked behind his
          back, wrapped around the handle of a .44 Magnum.

          DRIVER (O.S.)
          Thought you were dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          Now we get a good look at him. His name's WEBSTER. An old
          black man, as tough as Milton is angry.

                         PIPER
          Why does everyone keep saying that?

                         WEBSTER
          Because he IS dead. Sure as shit
          supposed to be anyway.
          Webster and Milton eye one another for a long beat then --

                         WEBSTER
          I carried your coffin, old man. I
          was there the day we put your ass
          in the ground.
          Piper stares at Milton. Milton stares at Webster.

                         MILTON
          Webster, you gonna yank that .44 or
          just keep stroking it?

                         WEBSTER
          That depends. How's this possible?

                         MILTON
          You heard about my daughter?

                         WEBSTER

                         (SOFTENS SLIGHTLY)
          I did.

                         MILTON
          Then you know why I'm back.

                         PIPER
          Back? Back from where? What. The
          Fuck. Are you two talking about?!

                         WEBSTER
          It true they took the little one?
          Milton nods.
          Webster considers for a long beat, then releases the .44.

                         WEBSTER
          Put her in neutral. I'll pull the
          truck around.
          But Piper can't tear her eyes away from Milton.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Police tape, half a dozen state and county cruisers. Three
          meat wagons and a news van. Humans buzz the scene like
          insects. The two dead State Troopers lie where they fell.
          Undisturbed. ROOKIE stands out. Young, county uniform, wide
          eyed. Very busy at having no idea what he should be doing.
          He scans the ground. His eyes go even wider.

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge! Sarge look at this!
          Rookie squats to the ground as SARGE, leather skin,
          approaches, stares, frowns.

                         SARGE
          Yeah?

                         ROOKIE
          Cigarette butt.

                         SARGE
          I see that.

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge! It's less than twenty feet
          from the victims!

                         SARGE
          And less than three feet from the
          ash bin.
          Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred
          cigarette butts salute the sky.

                         SARGE
          Pay attention, Rookie.
          But Rookie's attention has quickly OCD'd elsewhere.

                         ROOKIE
          Hey!

                         HIS POV
          CAP, an American Indian man walks the crime scene. Jeans,
          cowboy boots, a âDumbledore Dies On Page 596â sweatshirt.
          His dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are
          all business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         ROOKIE
          You! You can't be here!
          Rookie rushes forward.

                         SARGE
          Rookie!

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge, this joker can't just stomp
          around the crime scene.
          Sarge catches up, nods with respect to Cap.

                         SARGE
          Captain. Sorry about that.
          Cap looks up then stares at Rookie's feet.

                         CAP
          One of yours?

                         SARGE
          Yessir, I won't let it happen
          again.

                         CAP
          Get him out of here.

                         SARGE
          Cap, he's green, that's all.

                         CAP
          He's standing on evidence.
          Rookie leaps back revealing two shell casings.
          Cap kneels, stares.

                         CAP

          357.
          Suddenly a Unformed Officer leans from within the bar.

                         UNIFORMED OFFICER
          Cap! We got a live one.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Several officers motion Cap behind the bar toward an open
          cabinet. Cap crosses to the cabinet and kneels.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          Candy hides within. Naked, hugs her knees. Shivers.

                         CAP

                         (TO MEN)
          Get me a blanket. And get a medic
          in here.
          He turns to Candy, offers a comforting smile.

                         CAP
          You're gonna be okay now. I won't
          let anything happen to you.

                         CANDY
          He...he killed them. He killed all
          of them.

                         CAP
          Who did?

                         CANDY
          No. You don't understand, we was
          fuckin'. He killed them while we was
          fuckin'. That's never happened to me
          before, has it happened to you?
          Cap turns to Sarge who is standing near.

                         CAP
          Let's get a shrink in here too.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S WRECKER - DUSK - EST.

          A giant barn surrounded by an army of muscle car's laid to
          rest on cement blocks.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DUSK

          Engines dangle from assorted winches. Auto tools hang from
          the walls. Stacks of tires, a pile of carburetors.
          Webster throws a lever.
          The wrecker winch lowers the GTO.
          Piper crosses to the front, pops the hood. Webster joins
          her, stares at the engine. Frowns.

                         WEBSTER
          Engine's shot to hell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         PIPER
          Can you fix it?
          He leans close, hands caress the engine, searching.
          Somewhere near a fire CRACKLES. Piper turns.

                         HER POV
          Milton stands just through the barn doors, stokes a fire
          within a 50 gallon drum. Flames rising.

                         PIPER
          I don't...how is this possible?

                         WEBSTER
          He loved his daughter.

                         PIPER
          Lots of daddy's love their
          daughters, doesn't explain
          shattering reality.

                         WEBSTER
          That one loved his little girl
          enough to make her hate him.
          (off her stare)
          Like Timmy yellin' at Lassie to go
          home?
          Piper looks even more confused.

                         WEBSTER
          You never watched...forget it.
          Milton was a bad husband but he was
          a good father. Used to say it was
          the only thing he was ever good at.
          Then we went and got mixed up with
          the wrong crowd. Power and money
          and once you're in there ain't no
          gettin' out. So to keep her safe
          he vanished the year before she
          went off to college.

                         PIPER
          Obviously you got out.
          Webster glances at Milton for a moment.

                         WEBSTER
          The bastards we were workin' for, they
          were gonna kill us when the job was
          done.

          75.

                         WEBSTER (CONT'D)
          So the day before, Milton paid'em a
          little visit. He went alone you see.
          I didn't know. I would'a gone with him
          but I didn't know.
          Webster goes very quiet.

                         WEBSTER
          Being a daddy wasn't the only thing
          Milton was good at. Sumbitch was
          good at being a friend.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DUSK

          The sun's setting to the West. Milton stands dangerously
          close to the fire. Stares at the dancing flames.

          WEBSTER (O.S.)
          That fire makin you homesick?
          Piper and Webster approach with a six pack.

                         WEBSTER
          Cold beer?
          Milton gazes up at the moon. It isn't full but it's close.
          The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it.

                         MILTON
          You know the pain and suffering
          ain't the worse part, right?
          That's what they tell ya, what they
          want you to believe. But it's all
          a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst
          part's the goddamn video feed.
          Webster and Piper exchange a glance.

                         MILTON
          It ain't about the fire and brimstone.
          Ain't about your suffering. It's
          about the suffering of them you love.
          Cuz you see it. You see it all. In
          full goddamn detail. And there ain't
          nothin you can do about it.
          Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL into the air.

                         MILTON
          Fuckin son-in-law. He looked like
          one of them tree-huggin piece of
          shits. Wore sandals. What kind of
          man wears fuckin sandals?

          76.

                         MILTON (CONT'D)

                         (A BEAT)
          But I saw how he died. Fought like
          a fuckin banshee.
          Milton goes quiet.

                         MILTON
          He loved that daughter of mine.
          Loved that little baby too. He
          kept fightin long after he should'a
          been dead. But some people's
          better at killin than others. Just
          how they're wired.
          Milton's finding it harder to speak.

                         MILTON
          Then them sons of bitches turned on
          my...nosir, physical pain is nothin
          compared to watching your baby
          girl...watchin those fuckers...I'm
          gonna kill'em. I'm gonna kill'em
          all. And...and then I'll be done.
          Milton finally goes silent.
          Piper makes a noise. Involuntary. Tears stream down her
          cheeks. She's trying not to sob.
          Webster looks steely. Determined.

                         WEBSTER
          Milton, I can't fix that car. But
          I can get you were you need to be.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - NIGHT

          A huge sliding barn door opens into a giant stall revealing a
          1969 Chevrolet Nova 396 L-78 and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro.
          Milton and Piper stare. Webster smiles.

                         WEBSTER
          Milt, if memory serves you were
          always partial to the Nova, yes?

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DISTANT RIDGE - NIGHT

          We're staring down over the barn from a distant ridge as we
          hear the GLASS-PACKED RUMBLE of the Nova's engine.

          MOVE TO REVEAL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          JONAH standing on the ridge top, cell phone to his ear.

                         JONAH KING
          Yeah, about that fella who killed
          all them people at the Bull by the
          Balls last night. The fella who
          killed two of your cops. I know
          where you can find him.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DAWN

          The sun rises to the east burning off the Utah dew.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - CAR STALL - DAWN

          Milton crosses to the 69 Nova. Stops. Stares.

                         HIS POV
          Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat.

                         MILTON
          What are you doing?
          Piper pops awake, sits up. Already angry.

                         PIPER
          Fuck are you doing?!
          Milton stares.

                         PIPER
          Think you were gonna sneak off by
          yourself?! Go it alone?!

                         MILTON
          Uh, no. I need your help. If
          you're still willing.
          Piper stares for a moment.

                         PIPER
          Oh.
          A beat.

                         PIPER
          Well if I'd known that I would have
          slept in a bed!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DAWN

          Milton opens the big barn doors as Piper drives the Nova out
          into the sun light.
          Webster approaches with a shotgun and a box of shells.

                         WEBSTER
          Mapquest says it's an eight hour
          drive and we got twelve until
          midnight so we should be fine. And
          get this, âThe Mother of all
          thingsâ? âBleeds black tears unto
          those who cut herâ? Take a guess
          what's really bleeding like a stuck
          pig from the marsh?

                         MILTON
          Black tears of oil?

                         WEBSTER
          Damn right.

                         MILTON
          Webster, I need you to stay here.

                         WEBSTER
          Wha? No. You went alone last time.

                         MILTON
          I'm not going alone this time.
          Piper's coming with me.

                         WEBSTER
          You take that little girl over me?

                         MILTON
          Give me the fuckin shells. And the gun.
          Milton snatches both and hands them to Piper. He then
          quickly places an arm around Webster's shoulders and walks
          him out of earshot.
          Piper places the gun and shells in the backseat then stares
          at the two men.
          They glance back at her several times. Then Webster nods.
          Milton returns, slides into the passenger seat.

                         MILTON
          Let's go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Piper stares out the window as Webster slips quietly into the
          barn. He does so reluctantly.

                         PIPER
          He's not coming?

                         MILTON
          He's too old. He'll just slow us
          down. Get himself killed.

                         PIPER
          That's what you told him?

                         MILTON
          That's what Timmy told Lassie isn't it?

                         PIPER
          Who the fuck is this Timmy and
          Lassie you two keep talking about?!

                         MILTON
          This ain't gonna be easy, Piper. I
          need you. That's no lie. But are
          you sure about this?

                         PIPER
          Just drive the damn car.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - BORDER - DAY

          We see a âWelcome to Nevadaâ sign as --
          The Nova THUNDERS past.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Milton behind the wheel, Piper has her bare feet on the
          windshield as she loads shotgun shells into the slits on a
          hunting vest.

                         PIPER
          I never knew him. Momma said he
          was a drifter.

                         MILTON
          I ain't your daddy.

                         PIPER
          Fuck you if you are.
          Milton notices something in the rear view.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MILTON
          Shit.
          Piper sits up, stares.

          THROUGH BACK GLASS
          There's a State Trooper's car way back there. Fuck. There
          are two. No lights yet but they are coming up fast.

                         PIPER
          What do we do?

                         MILTON
          Nothing yet. Not until...
          The lights come on.

                         PIPER
          Oh shit. They know.

                         MILTON
          We can't stop.
          Milton mashes the peddle to the floor.

                         PIPER
          Milton, this will never work.

                         MILTON
          It'll work.

                         PIPER
          No. It won't. Nobody gets away
          anymore. In fifteen minutes there
          will be choppers, we'll be all over
          the news...
          She breaks off. Her mouth drops.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police
          barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway
          in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line
          the side of the road.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          Twenty cruisers. Thirty TROOPERS are set up behind their
          vehicles, shotguns and assault rifles in hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Cap, the American Indian Police Captain, stands in front, a
          radio to his mouth.

                         CAP
          Just keep driving him to us. We'll
          do the rest. And make sure you
          peel off before the fireworks.
          He lowers the handset, addresses the men.

                         CAP
          Gentlemen, these two killed two of
          our own. I know you'd like them to
          pay. Therefore, when I tell you to
          aim for the tires, what I mean is
          aim for their heads. Are we clear?
          The men nod with steely determination.

                         CAP
          Very good. Please aim for the tires.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          The barricade is approaching stupidly fast. For the first
          time on this adventure, Milton looks...concerned.

                         PIPER
          Just don't stop.

                         MILTON
          Too many of them.

                         PIPER
          Just keep driving.

                         MILTON
          I'm...I'm sorry I got you into--

                         PIPER
          --They took your granddaughter,
          Milton, and now these badge-wearing
          fuckers are trying to stop you.
          You crawled out of the Goddamn
          abyss...and a few fat-assed county
          Mounties are giving you pause?
          Your grand-baby needs you.
          Milton nods. Turns back to the road.

                         PIPER
          You know what happens to her if
          they stop us.

          You lose the last connection you
          will ever have to this world. You
          gotta drive.
          A scowl crosses his face.

                         PIPER
          No. You don't just drive. Drive
          angry! Drive with the motherfuckin'
          rage that'll take us through that
          motherfuckin' roadblock!

          Sarge from earlier approaches Cap.

          He ain't stopping.

                         CAP
          Good. Makes our job easier.
          Suddenly a noise catches them off guard. They turn behind
          them. Their eyes widen.

                         THEIR POV
          A Mack Truck RUMBLES over the bridge approaching from behind
          them. It's pulling 80mph at least.

          Well...this is unexpected.

          Piper shoves the shotgun in his hand. He quickly shoves it
          out the window and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          QUICKFIRES three blasts!

          EXT. MACK TRUCK - TRAILER HITCH - DAY

          The hydraulics line BURSTS! Hydraulic fluid bleeds like a
          stuck jugular!
          The metal brackets holding the trailer in place...RELEASE!

          EXT. MACK TRUCK - DAY

          Truck and Flatbed separate!
          The back of the flatbed catches on a cruiser. The front
          flips around.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY


                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          We can just make out the Accountant's face. He's smiling.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          The Nova rips through the opening between truck and trailer!
          And then blazes past the scattered and overturned cruisers
          and tears onto the bridge!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          Cap staggers into the road, FIRING at the Nova!

                         CAP
          Hurry! After them!
          Those men still near, scramble toward the working vehicles as

          SCRRREEEECH.
          The Mack skids to a stop behind them, now parallel across the
          blacktop. Driver's side angled back at the bridge.
          Every gun in the area spins as the driver's side door opens.
          The Accountant steps out, big smile on his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          CLOSE ON SARGE AND CAP

                         SARGE
          You want us to shoot out his tires?

                         ON ACCOUNTANT
          As he smiles and flips his coin high into the air.
          The surrounding Troopers stare.
          The Accountant catches it. Holds it high between thumb and
          forefinger for all to see.

          POV FROM TROOPERS
          He's holding an FBI badge in the air.

                         CAP
          No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way
          in God's good heaven are you a...
          The Accountant steps down, thrusting his âbadge' into Cap's
          face stopping him cold.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Need you boys to stand down. Captain,
          you know what this badge means, right?
          Not a single gun lowers. All trained at The Accountant.
          Itching to blow him out of his expensive shoes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Federal Bureau of get the fuck
          outta my way. You boys have
          blundered into an on-going Federal
          case. Now, lower your...
          He stops, turns...sniffs the air.
          His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED TROOPER.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You.
          ANGLE - Looking down on The Accountant surrounded by armed
          angry troopers. He steps from the truck, nudges Cap aside
          like he wasn't there. Cap can't believe it.
          Shot continues, moving down, closer and closer until the
          Accountant is face to face with a Young Faced Trooper.
          The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Suddenly the Accountant moves fast. He bats the gun aside,
          snatches the kid's uniform shirt and pulls it open, popping
          two buttons.

                         YOUNG-FACED TROOPER
          Hey, Hey!!! Cap!
          And there...above the kid's left breast...a pentagram tattoo.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It seems you're serving two masters.
          The kid says nothing stares. Every cop's gun is sighted on
          the Accountant. He doesn't seem to notice.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Take out your phone and call him.
          Call Jonah King. Tell him the old
          man is dead.
          The kid stares until...

                         CAP
          Go ahead, Trooper. Do as the agent
          says. Rest of you. Stand down. Now!
          Guns lower. The kid removes his cell phone and dials.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY

          We tear West down the highway as we catch up to the Nova and
          dive down...toward the back glass until --

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Piper stares through the back window.

                         PIPER
          I don't think...why aren't they
          following us?
          Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face.

                         MILTON
          They're likely scared of you.

                         PIPER
          Now what?

                         MILTON
          Now we drive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          We pull back...

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY

          ...out of the back glass as the Nova speeds up.
          Faster...faster. The sun suddenly time lapses across the
          sky. The landscape blurs. Only the Nova and the moving sun
          remain...until the sun dips into the Western horizon and
          vanishes...replaced by one hell of a bright full moon.

          EXT. SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA - NIGHT

          Suddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a
          rocky outcropping in the distance.
          We slow and drop toward the ground until we're mere inches
          above the cracked earth...we come to a stop.

                         FOOM
          A BOOT slams into view.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT

          Milton climbs from the Nova. In the distance we can hear
          DRUMS. BONGOS. There's CHANTING. And LAUGHTER.
          Piper rises and gazes at him over the roof. She's scared.
          Milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband, slides the
          ancient revolver into a leather hip-holster then he leans in
          and grabs his shotgun.

                         MILTON
          Stay here.
          Piper nods.
          Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon
          we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton
          moves toward a cliff's edge.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

          Milton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge.

                         MILTON'S POV

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          A twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below. The ravine
          is filled with giant oil derricks, like metallic T-Rex's,
          rising and falling to the SHRIEK of oiled metal.
          And in the center of this Jurassic gathering, a CROWD of
          people dance and sway around a giant bonfire. It is
          celebration, ritual and orgy rolled into one.
          Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the
          opposite side of the Oil-Rig ravine - the battered RV sits
          like a mobile command post.

          CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
          He was expecting less than twenty followers. There are forty
          down there. Fuck.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT

          Milton walks slowly back toward the Nova. His head lowered
          in deep thought. How does one man and a kid take on forty?
          Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face!
          He jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead.

                         HIS POV
          Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant.

                         MILTON
          Get away from her.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I think not.

                         MILTON
          I shoot you with this, you know
          what it means. No heaven. No
          hell. You cease to exist.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          All the more reason to keep Ms.
          Piper in close proximity. You are
          old, Milton. You might miss again.

                         MILTON
          You can't stop me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Stop you? Milton, you wouldn't be
          here without me, you ungrateful
          shit. That roadblock back there,
          that would have stopped you. So I
          want you to drop that iron God-
          Killer and say thank you.
          Milton stares.
          The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick,
          suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I said, drop it and thank you.
          Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the
          darkness behind him.

                         MILTON
          Don't hurt her. Th-Thank you.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's better.
          He lowers the blade, but keeps Piper close.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You're not the first to get out and
          I doubt you'll be the last but I
          gotta know, HOW did you get out
          with the God-Killer?

                         MILTON

                         (CHUCKLES)
          I just walked in and took it.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You did not.

                         MILTON
          I'm an old washed up lifer. Never
          occurred to'em that I was up to no good.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Wouldn't wanna be you when he finds
          out.

                         MILTON
          What's he gonna do? Not let me
          back in? Now, I gotta know. Why?
          Why help me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         PIPER
          I know why. It's because of those
          crazy fucks out there isn't it?
          They figured something out didn't
          they? Somehow they know how to
          summon a piece of hell to earth.
          The Accountant laughs.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's cute. You haven't told her?

                         MILTON
          She don't listen.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a
          little secret. The Dark Lord?
          Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply
          the warden of a very large prison.
          Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful.
          Well read. I happen to know the
          idea of sacrificing children in his
          honor annoys him greatly.

                         MILTON
          Then why? Why help me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Simple. Like the warden, we all
          have jobs to do. Getting you here
          makes my job easier. You get what
          you want, I get what I want.

                         MILTON
          Then help me, now. There are forty of
          them down there. You and I could--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No.

                         MILTON

                         BUT--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No. You want to save her then go
          do it. If you win, I win. If they
          take you down, I win.
          He hugs Piper closer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You like butter on your popcorn?
          It's sure to be a grand show.
          Piper doesn't know what to say.
          The Accountant glances back at Milton.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You're still here? Milton, the clock
          is ticking. Midnight approaches.

                         MILTON
          Then get off my fuckin car.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          The RV door flings open revealing Jonah King. He walks with
          arrogance through the orgy around him, his followers turn to
          him with reverence. His name is WHISPERED like a secret.
          He approaches the make-shift stone altar where Skanky Gal
          holds the baby within a bundle of blankets.
          HIGH ABOVE: the moon is full and ripe.

                         JONAH KING
          It's almost time.
          Skanky Gal nods. But there is hesitation in her eyes. She's
          grown attached to the baby.
          Jonah takes the baby, places her on the stone altar.

                         JONAH KING
          My brothers and sisters, we have come
          so far. To this place where the
          dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul
          at our feet. From its death, it shall
          be reborn. As we will be. We who
          have survived the slings. The
          arrows. The revulsion of those too
          weak to believe. We have been cast
          out. And hunted. But no more.
          Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck.
          Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably
          elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah.
          The Followers GASP in holy awe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         JONAH KING
          (raising the knife)
          With this sacrifice, no more will
          we be shunned. They say the meek
          will inherit. They LIE. We are
          not meek. We are chosen. The
          hounds of perdition will howl at
          our command. For now we...
          A HOWLING noise.
          No. An engine. Distant but thunderous.
          Heads turn. The sound echoes throughout the ravine then --

          FOOOM!
          The NOVA ROCKETS from the cliff's edge!
          It plummets straight at the cultists!
          They scatter! But three are not so lucky, they vanish as the
          giant Chevy turns them to PULP!
          Jonah's jaw drops. This can't fuckin' be.
          Skanky Gal, grabs the baby and flees toward one of the giant
          oil derricks!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton wears a mask of rage as he rips the Nova into a 180,
          his 357 aimed out the window.

          KABOOM! BOOM! KUHFWOOM!
          He's shooting Cultists in a barrel.
          But the Nova is the better weapon. He FLOORS it, then LOCKS
          the brakes, fishtailing.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          The Nova's ass-end veers like a dragon's tail SMACKING
          cultists aside with BONE-SHATTERING brutality.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          Jonah grabs a shotgun from behind the altar, opens FIRE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JONAH KING
          Kill him! KILL HIM!
          Followers produce an assortment of firepower and RIDDLE the
          Nova with lead!
          Milton sights Jonah, ready to blow him to fuck, catches the
          reverend while he cocks the pump.
          JONAH can see Milton's got him.
          MILTON grits and pulls the 357's trigger: Click. Click.

          BLAM!
          Jonah fires a fresh round - barely missing as--
          Milton GUNS the engine - SMASHES two followers head on. They
          fly up the hood, SMASH the glass - but shield him from
          another frontal assault. Their bodies RIDDLED with lead.
          The Cultists circle him to get a better shot.
          A Magnum is thrust into the driver's side window - right in
          Milton's face.
          He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
          wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the
          fucker's hand. The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton.
          Milton twirls the Magnum, gunslinger style. Jams the barrel
          into the Cultist's face and FIRES.
          Milton runs down any that get in his way.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

          The Accountant stands above the battle, Piper at his side.
          He can hear her heartbeat.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You want to help him.

                         PIPER
          Yes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He chose you, you know that. Fast
          car, spunky attitude. He put your
          life at risk and you still want to
          help him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         PIPER
          Yes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Then go.
          She rushes toward a goat path leading down to the valley
          below. Suddenly something catches her eye.

          CLOSE ON GROUND
          The Ancient Revolver.
          Without the slightest pause, Piper snatches it, spins and
          aims it right at...
          The Accountant's smiling face.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Hold on tight. It has quite a kick.

                         PIPER
          If I kill you, you can't take him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Someone else will come...someone
          else always comes.
          Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Piper, he didn't steal that gun to
          kill me. He stole it to slow me down.
          He's getting what he wanted. Now, go
          to him. Before it's too late.
          Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path.

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with
          bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain
          down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Ducking in the seat, unable to see, Milton fights to keep

                         CONTROL UNTIL:
          Jonah BLASTS the front driver's side tire, SHREDDING it -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          The NOVA pitches hard to the left, PIN-WHEELING right into an
          oil derrick.
          The SCREAM of metal on metal rips through the ravine. The
          Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips
          from the wreck.
          Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around
          the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door.
          Jonah nods to Tattoo who approaches close to the ground,
          reaches out slowly and YANKS the door open.

          KA-FOOM!
          Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast!

                         JONAH KING
          Kill him!
          Jonah and his men open FIRE!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He
          clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite
          the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Jonah and his men draw closer and closer.

                         THEIR POV
          Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open
          driver's side door.

          PIPER (O.S.)

          HEY!
          The men spin to find Piper standing behind them, ancient
          revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the trigger.

          KAFOOM!
          Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off her feet, the gun
          jerked from her hands.
          She lands on her back. Hard. The wind KNOCKED out of her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          The GOD SLUG slams into a cultist's stomach. It EXPLODES
          through him, and into the BATTERED RV BEHIND:

          KABLAAAAM!
          The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and cultists helter
          skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five.
          JONAH is spattered with his men's blood, dives behind the
          wreck of the Nova.

                         JONAH KING
          Well...this has all gone to shit.
          He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the
          Nova's open driver's side door.

                         HIS POV
          Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone.
          Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But
          nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find...
          Milton crawling. Bleeding.

          MILTON'S POV
          Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick.
          The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms.
          Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won.
          He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin.

                         JONAH KING
          You lose.

                         (LOOKS UP)
          Get over here!
          Skanky continues to cower. Doesn't budge.

                         JONAH KING
          I said get over here! I want him
          to watch me kill the kid!
          Skanky doesn't move.

                         JONAH KING

                         (TO MILTON)
          Stupid bitch. Fine. Then just
          know I promise to kill her slowly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Jonah raises the barrel to Milton's forehead then...
          Someone near CLEARS HIS THROAT.
          Jonah turns, stares.
          The Accountant leans against the Nova's hulk. He winks.
          At Jonah's feet, Milton scrambles forward and we realize he
          wasn't crawling toward his grand-baby.
          He was crawling toward the ancient revolver.
          He snatches it, rolls onto his back as--
          Jonah swings his gun toward Milton --

          KAFOOM!
          The burning God Slug HITS JONAH IN THE FACE!
          Jonah's head is obliterated. The force yanks his headless
          body into the air, spins it sky-wards in a plume of flame.
          The Accountant moves away, watching as --
          The burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the Nova.

          THE GAS IGNITES
          FLAMES ERUPT with THUNDER clear to the heavens - the Nova
          ROARS one final time, living up to it's name in a furious
          ball of fire that consumes whatever's left of Jonah King.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire lighting her face.

                         PIPER
          Milton?!
          He lies on his back several yards away.
          Piper rushes up, falls beside him.
          He's alive, mouth filled with blood. She takes his hand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Skanky Gal looks up to find...
          ...the Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          She hands him the baby.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm curious. Would you have let
          him do it?
          She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's what I thought.
          He turns and walks away from her.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          See you. Soon.
          Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness.

          ON MILTON AND PIPER

                         PIPER
          Milton...no...
          Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick
          around. Searching.

                         MILTON
          Where...where is she?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          She's here.
          The Accountant hands the baby to Milton.
          Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes.
          Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way.
          He places her in Piper's arms.

                         MILTON
          Keep her safe.

                         PIPER
          I will. Anyone tries to hurt her
          and I'll kill'em.

                         MILTON
          I know. That's why I chose you.

          A HORN BLARES.
          They all turn toward the high cliff.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         THEIR POV
          WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro.

                         MILTON
          Webster will look after you both.
          As long as he can. And he'll keep
          trying long after he can't.

                         PIPER
          Milton. This can't...you can't
          just give up. There's gotta be
          something we can do to...

                         MILTON
          Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna
          happen. I'm askin more than I have
          a right to. I know it. But love
          her for me, Piper. Love her and
          make her yours. I don't have any
          right to ask for your promise...

                         PIPER

                         (WITHOUT HESITATION)
          I promise. Milton. I promise.
          Milton coughs.

                         MILTON
          Thank you.
          And like that. The life fades from his eyes.
          Piper holds the baby close, SOBS.
          She looks up at the Accountant. But he is gone.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - DAWN

          The sun glows to the east as --
          --Piper cradles the baby as she climbs the goat path where
          Webster is waiting. He rushes to her, places an arm around
          her. Leads her toward the Camaro as --

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - DAWN


          CLOSE ON MILTON
          He twitches.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          His one good eye opens. It rolls around then settles on
          something above.

                         MILTON
          How was that?

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          The Accountant stands over him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I've seen better. Guess she
          doesn't know you can beat him, slow
          him, shoot him, even stop him...

                         MILTON
          ...But you can't kill a dead man.
          Milton sits up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out.
          The Accountant takes it. Pulls him to his feet.
          They turn and walk toward the rising sun.
          They walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright
          yellow glow...then...
          ...they fade into the shimmering heat...
          ...and they are gone.

          FADE TO BLACK.

     BLACK

     FADE IN to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of
     the REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO, who sits against smooth
     black rock. Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and
     her skin is a haunting translucent white. Her voice
     ECHOES as if in a great cavern.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe.

           RESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe. We know
               of spice...the spice called melange...the
               greatest treasure in the Universe. It
               exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis,
               Dune. We know of spice and the Bene
               Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding
               plan of ninety generations to produce the
               Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will
               awaken.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               And now the prophecy...

     Silence...then a powerful low organ NOTE resounding
     in the cavernous space.

            REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D)
               He will come...the voice from the outer
               world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad,
               which will cleanse the Universe and bring
               us out of darkness. He will have been born
               of a Bene Gesserit mother.
--
     The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the
     Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ
     BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice.

     The picture FADES.

     FADE IN to:

     ...interior of one drop of water. The image changes
     subtly.

2A.  EXT. - DROP - NIGHT

     PULL BACK to a shot revealing the outside of the
     drop. There is a distant ROARING and within the drop
     we can see the distorted image of a space ship
     landing on a sophisticated landing field.

3A. EXT. LANDING FIELD - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     On the dark landing field, chemicals spill out of
     the ship in troughs and tank-suited Guildsmen begin
     to swarm out of a hatch opening.

4. through 6.  (Deleted)

7.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in
     his Throne Room.

     Suddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and
     quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND
     begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly
     begin to clear the large room. Several women are
     rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman,
     IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring
     look to her father, the Emperor.

                         IRULAN
               Father.
--
                         EMPEROR
               Irulan.

     She sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him
     now, speaking to him. Irulan turns and leaves. The
     Emperor moves away from his officers to the center
     of the now-empty room. He drops his golden robe from
     his shoulders. He stands in his elegant black
     uniform, thinking.

     The Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar
     Officers leave her alone with the Emperor.

                         EMPEROR
                    (quickly)
               A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here
               within minutes!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We felt his presence.

                         EMPEROR
               I shall want telepathy during his visit
               and a report when we're finished.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Their minds are so.... They move in
               strange directions....

                         EMPEROR
               Yes?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Forced spice evolution of humans changes
               many things.... I must sit close to him.

                         EMPEROR
               He will not permit anyone but me to see
               him. You must be outside this room.... Do
               what you can.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I am your Truthsayer, my lord...
                    (sensing something outside the room)
               He is here, my lord.

     Under the carved inscription "Law is the Ultimate
     Science", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide
     open and FIFTY GUILDSMEN wheel in a forty-foot long
     giant black box. One of the Guildsmen addresses the
     Emperor through a translating device.

                   TANKED GUILDSMEN #1
               The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.
--
     The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother.

                         EMPEROR
               Leave us.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Yes, my Lord.

                         EMPEROR
                    (after she has gone)
               We are alone...

8.   INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a
     seat on a chair just outside the door. She closes
     her eyes.

9.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Inside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED
     GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a "V"
     formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens,
     slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass
     tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR
     twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty,
     pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper.

     The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas,
     and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic
     chemical spills dripping from under the tank.
     Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the
     Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a
     huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep
     blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an
     intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the
     tank translates into English and broadcasts it into
     the room.

                        NAVIGATOR
               We have just folded space from Ix...

                         EMPEROR
                    (extremely nervous)
               Yes?... How was your journey?

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (after a long pause)
               Many machines on Ix... new machines.

                         EMPEROR
               Oh yes?
--
                        NAVIGATOR
               Better than those on Richesse.. You are
               transparent... I see many things... I see
               plans within plans.

                         EMPEROR
               Is there a problem?... Usually there is a
               problem when one of you makes a visit.

     No answer.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (finally)
               The answer is within the problem...

10.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother
     sits, her eyes closed, straining.

11.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     A very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild
     Navigator. She is not getting the English version
     but a much different language version which is
     fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song
     monologue.

12.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                        NAVIGATOR
               I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides,
               House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you
               behind it.

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

     The Navigator breathes the spice-gas heavily and
     swishes gently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               You must share with us.
--
                         EMPEROR
               The Atreides house is building a secret
               army!... using a technique unknown to
               us... a technique involving sound. The
               Duke is becoming more popular in the
               Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I
               have ordered House Atreides to occupy
               Arrakis to mine the spice... thus
               replacing their enemies the Harkonnens....
               House Atreides will not refuse because of
               the tremendous power they think they will
               gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron
               Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and
               launch a sneak attack on House Atreides...
               I have promised the Baron five legions of
               my Sardaukar terror troops.

                        NAVIGATOR
               So the Harkonnens will rid you of House
               Atreides...

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

13.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene
     mentally. She suddenly sees and flinches.

14.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     The Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very
     close to her. We hear the Navigator speak to her.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (to Reverend Mother, mentally)
               Reverend Mother... I will give you the
               Tleilaxu Path.

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
                    (an excited whisper)
               A chance for escape? But for whom?

15.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                         EMPEROR
               Can you hear me?... If this visit has
               anything to do with spice...
--
     The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite
     violently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the
               spice has given me accelerated evolution
               for four thousand years... it has enabled
               you to live two hundred years... the spice
               helps make the sapho juice, which gives
               the red-lipped mentats the ability to be
               living computers... the secret side of
               spice... the water of life.

16.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE  - NIGHT

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               He shouldn't speak of this...

15.  BACK TO SCENE

                        NAVIGATOR
               ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the
               metaphysical ability to see beyond...to
               have superior powers... Our power to fold
               space is in the spice... Without us, your
               empire would be lost on isolated scattered
               planets... You would be lost.

                         EMPEROR
               I can assure you...

                        NAVIGATOR
               Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly
               of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...

16.  BACK TO SCENE

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               Here it comes...

17.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                        NAVIGATOR
               We ourselves... foresee a slight problem
               within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul
               Atreides.

                         EMPEROR
               You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides...
               his father.

24.  EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     High on the rock cliff stands Castle Caladan, Its
     appearance us dark and medieval. There is a window
     on the seaward wall lit from within...

25.  INT. TRAINING ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     ...by a drifting glowglobe. Paul sits at an L-shaped
     table studying filmbooks and maps of Arrakis and the
     Universe.

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     We SEE vast star fields and galaxies.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               Here we are now... nineteen light years
               beyond...

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     We SEE the galaxies move as we HEAR a HUM.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (whispering)
               ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.

     We HOLD on this, then we see Arrakis grow larger in
     the filmbook screen and we SEE it is a planet of
     vast deserts.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
                    (whispering again)
               It does look dry....

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     The picture grows larger again, and we see the
     Arrakeen Valley.
--
                     FILMBOOK (V.O.)
               Each day the palms along the outer wall of
               the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough
               water to sustain the lives of one hundred
               men. The palms were placed by the
               Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in
               front of the city Fremen.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Where are the Harkonnens from here?

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     The star fields and galaxies move slightly then.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (whispering)
               There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron
               Harkonnen... the enemy.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

     In the background, FOOTSTEPS grow louder, pounding
     on thick wooden floors. THUFIR HAWAT, GURNEY HALLECK
     and DR. YUEH enter. Paul has his back to the door.
     Thufir suddenly looks perturbed when he notices
     this.

                          PAUL
                    (without turning)
               I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back
               to the door.

     Hawat suppresses a smile.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming
               down the hall.

                         THUFIR
               Those sounds could be imitated.

                          PAUL
               I'd know the difference.

     Paul rises and turns to face them.
--
                         THUFIR
                    (inner voice)
               Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

                          PAUL
               My father sent you to test me. Music then?

     Thufir scowls.

                         GURNEY
               No music. I'm packing this for the
               crossing. Shield practice.

                          PAUL
               Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice
               -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.

                         GURNEY
                    (angered)
               Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for
               cattle and love play... not fighting.

                          PAUL
               I'm sorry Gurney.

                         GURNEY
               Not sorry enough.

     Gurney draws his knife.

25B. SHIELD EFFECT - THE FIGHT

     Gurney activates his body shield, sending a
     shimmering FORCE FIELD around his body. He advances
     swiftly toward Paul. Paul snaps on his FORCE FIELD,
     draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself
     hurriedly for the fight.

                         GURNEY
                    (his voice sounding strange through
                    the forcefield)
               Guard yourself for true!

     Gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious
     attack. Paul falls back. The shield edges CRACK
     loudly as they touch each other.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What's gotten into Gurney? He's not
               faking.
     Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly
     around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger
     as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul
     directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney
     against the table, plunging at just the right moment
     to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade
     right at Gurney's neck.

                          PAUL
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Is this what you seek?

                         GURNEY
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Good... the slow blade penetrates the
               shield... but look down.

     Paul looks and sees Gurney's blade at his groin.

                     GURNEY (CONT'D)
               We'd have joined each other in death.
               However, you did seem to finally get the
               "mood".

                          PAUL
               Would you really have drawn my blood?

                         GURNEY
               If you'd fought one whit below your
               abilities I'd have scratched you a good
               one.

     Paul stands and snaps off his shield as does Gurney.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Things have been so serious here lately.

                         GURNEY
               Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but
               this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we
               leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The
               Harkonnens are real.

     Thufir, Yueh, Gurney and Paul stare at each other
     for a moment in silence. Dr. Yueh moves forward and
     begins to take Paul's pulse rate and to collect
     other data with a small black machine.

                          PAUL
               Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on
               the worms of Arrakis?
--
                        DR. YUEH
               I have obtained a filmbook on a small
               specimen... only 125 meters long.

                          PAUL
               Only?!

     They smile at each other.

                        DR. YUEH
               There are have been documented sightings
               of worms as large as 450 meters in the
               deep desert -- far from where we'll be in
               Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south
               polar regions are marked forbidden....
               Why?

                          PAUL
               The storms and the worms. Is it true, that
               the sand can blow at seven hundred
               kilometers per hour?

                          YUEH
               It can render flesh to dust in minutes.
               And these dry winds can generate
               tremendous static electricity in the
               atmosphere. Our body shields won't have
               enough power to operate in the open air on
               Arrakis.

                          PAUL
               Well, how do the Fremen survive there?

                          YUEH
               We don't know much about the Fremen...
               They live in the deep desert... some of
               them in the cities and they have blue-
               within-blue eyes...

                          PAUL
                    (smiling)
               The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the
               blood by the spice -- melange. Could the
               spice affect us in other ways?

                         THUFIR
               Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we
               know the Harkonnens would not have given
               up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

                          PAUL
                    (rising)
               The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but
               behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.
--
                         THUFIR
               You will make a formidable Duke!

     Paul bows.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Now remember... the first step in avoiding
               a trap is knowing of its existence.

                          PAUL
               I know.  But if it is a trap then why are
               we going?

                         THUFIR
               We have our new army.
                    (in the same breath)
               Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.

     Thufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end
     of the training room, calls out to them.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Clear and lock the room.

     Gurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS
     above each doorway.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Activate a fighter.

25C. ROBOT FIGHT

     Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling.
     As the robot begins to rotate and go through several
     frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places
     a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it
     around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box.
     Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound
     through the weirding module as he rushes towards the
     robot.

                         GURNEY
                    (to Yueh)
               Precise control....

26.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     The hallway is empty in the foreground but in the
     distance a changing of the guard is seen.

27.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks down the stairway.  In the distance,
     moving troops are packing Atreides belongings.
     Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large
     bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried
     blood.

                          PAUL
               The bull that killed my grandfather... is
               this an evil omen?

     Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant
     black head.

                          PAUL
                    (happily)
               Duncan!

                         DUNCAN
               Paul.
                    (they shake hands)
               I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I
               have to go on ahead.

                          PAUL
               Why?  I wish you were coming with us.

                         DUNCAN
               It's something for your father.  He wants
               to talk to you.
                    (places hand on Paul's chest)
               I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of
               God be with you.

                          PAUL
               May the hand of God be with us all,
               Duncan.

28.  EXT. CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks to meet his father near the wall.

                          PAUL
                    (diffident)
               Father.

                        DUKE LETO
               Thank you for joining me, Paul.
                    (voice tired)
               It will be good to get to our new home and
               have all this upset behind us.

28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA

     They look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes
     below.

     The Duke turns to Paul.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               My son.
                    (out loud)
               Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
               three generations....  He swears you are
               the finest student he's ever taught.
               Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same....
               It makes me feel very proud...

                          PAUL
               I want you to be proud of me.

     Paul smiles up at his father.  The WIND blows the
     Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the
     green and black Atreides banner against the night
     sky beyond.  The RAIN starts again -- lightly.  Paul
     takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in
     the wind.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (studying the dark sea below)
               I'll miss the sea... but a person needs
               new experiences... they jar something deep
               inside, allowing him to grow.  Without
               change, something sleeps inside us... and
               seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.

     Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he
     sees the Duke's signet ring.  Again he smiles at his
     father.

                                                FADE TO:

30.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul is sweating during his sleep and WHISPERS as if
     struggling with some disturbing thought.
--
                          PAUL
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert
               Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet...
               moving... moving.

31.  DARK WATER - MENTAL IMAGE

     We see Paul's dream. It is very dark.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     Suddenly a drop falls into the black, and white hot
     widening rings appear on the dark water's surface.

     Darkness again. Two moons rise in the darkness. As
     the second appears:

                          VOICE
               The second moon, your moon...

31A. INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Dark again. A figure turns toward Paul. It is a
     BEAUTIFUL GIRL in deep shadow. She speaks.

                     BEAUTIFUL GIRL
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

32.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     CU Paul's face in fitful sleep.

33.  EXT. COURTYARD - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     In a small stone courtyard, the back-lit figure of a
     woman moves towards us through the heavy RAIN and
     darkness. As she nears us, the large, protective
     glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a
     beautiful woman -- JESSICA.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               I  know she has come to test him... no man
               has ever been tested with the box... only
               Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.

     The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius
     Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes
     her back toward the Castle. The rain rushes loudly
     into the storm drains.
--
34.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (whispering again)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet...
               moving... moving.

     CU Paul's face.

     Paul's eyes snap open. He hears footsteps outside
     his door. As the door opens he closes his eyes,
     however, and he pretends to be asleep. Jessica and
     the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway
     looking at him.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We'll salvage what we can... but I can
               tell you.. dear God... for the father...
               nothing.

     Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned! She
     turns back to look at Paul. Her hands tremble.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               Did you really think that you could bear
               the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               My greatest student... and my greatest
               disappointment.... He's awake!... He's
               listening to us.
                    (considering)
               Good... Ready yourself, young Paul
               Atreides... I want to see you in your
               mother's chamber in one quarter of an
               hour.

     She turns and walks away. Jessica remains at the
     door and calls out to Paul in the darkness.

                         JESSICA
               Paul?... This is very important...

     Jessica leaves, closing the door behind her. Paul
     sits up in bed.

                          PAUL
               Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father...
               nothing?

35.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Jessica and the Reverend Mother enter. It is quite
     dark. Jessica WHISPERS a code number and a glowglobe
     LIGHTS on a very dim setting.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (angrily)
               Jessica... You were told to bear only
               daughters to the Atreides... Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               It meant so much to him...

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You thought only of a Duke's desire for a
               son?... Desires don't figure in this! An
               Atreides daughter could have been wed to a
               Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We
               may lose both blood lines now.

                         JESSICA
               I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll
               pay for my own mistakes.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               And your son will pay with you.

42.  INT. DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Under a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on
     a scroll-like piece of paper.

     Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a
     cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red
     hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which
     seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING.

     He pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE
     COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He
     leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside
     the window.

     FADE TO:

35.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul enters the room and Jessica closes the door
     behind them.

                         JESSICA
               Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius
               Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe
               you...
                    (to Reverend Mother)
               Please...
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Jessica, you know it must be done. I
               enjoin you to stand guard at the door and
               practice the meditation of peace.

                         JESSICA
               Your Reverence.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What does she fear?
                    (out loud)
               What about my Father?

                         JESSICA
               Paul... please, Paul... listen to the
               Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

     Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks
     to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training
     which permits an adept to control others merely by
     selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if
     two people are talking -- one normal and the other
     gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is
     strange, yet subtle.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (using The Voice)
               Now you come here.

     Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he
     fights her controlling him.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               She's using The Voice.
                    (out loud)
               No.

     She sees him struggling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (inner voice)
               Some strength there. Surprising!
                    (out loud)
               Come here.

     The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               See this... Put your right hand in the
               box.

     Paul stares at the hole in the box.
--
                          PAUL
               What's in the box?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Pain.

     Just then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul
     sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               STOP! Put your hand in the box.

     Paul's hand goes in. Fear passes over his face.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The Voice again.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't
               pull away or you'll feel that poison. A
               Duke's son must know about many poisons --
               this one kills only animals.

                          PAUL
               Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an
               animal?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Let us say I suggest you may be human.
               Your awareness may be powerful enough to
               control your instincts. Your instincts
               will be to remove your hand from the box.
               If you do so you will die. You will feel
               an itching -- there... see? Now the
               itching becomes burning... heat, upon
               heat, upon heat.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               It burns.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               SILENCE... SILENCE.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(struggling to compose
                    himself)
               I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.
               Fear is the little death that brings total
               obliteration. I will face my fear... I
               will permit it to pass over me and through
               me.
--
     The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her
     ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches
     away breathes hotly. She is smiling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You feel the flesh crisping?

36.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     Paul's inner mind sees his hand on fire with all
     sorts of sores. The skin is bubbling.

37.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Flesh dropping off.

38.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     He pictures this. The destruction of his hand is
     complete -- now only blood spurts out and burns.

39.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul's face registers extreme pain.

                          PAUL
                    (cannot help the explosion)
               THE PAIN!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child
               ever withstood that much. I must have
               wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of
               the box and look at it, young human.... Do
               it!

     Paul pulls his hand out of the box. No sign of
     anything wrong. He turns his hand, flexes his
     fingers. He looks to the Reverend Mother.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (explaining)
               Pain by nerve induction... A human can
               resist any pain. Our test is crisis and
               observation.

                          PAUL
               I see the truth of it.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (inner voice)
               Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will
               he be ours to control?
                    (out loud)
               You know when people speak the truth?

                          PAUL
               I know it.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother holds her hand against
     Paul's head. She closes her eyes.

40.  INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE

     She sees a blurred image of Paul's earlier dream.
     She sees the beautiful girl turn. She hears a
     muffled voice say "Tell me of your homeworld, Usul".

41.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Your mother wants you to tell me about
               your dreams. I only want to know one
               thing.... Do they come true?

                          PAUL
               Not all of them... I know which ones will.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

                          PAUL
               What is it?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (profoundly)
               The person who can be many places at
               once... the one who bridges space and
               time.... He will look where we cannot.

                          PAUL
               Where?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Do you know of the Water of Life?... the
               Truthsayer drug?

                          PAUL
               I have heard of it.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
               It is very dangerous... very painful. The
               Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see
               within.... There is a place terrifying to
               us... to women. It is said a man will
               come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go
               where we cannot... Many men have tried...

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died....
                    (she calls out loudly)
               Jessica!

     Jessica enters immediately and sees with great
     relief that Paul is still active.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the
               regular order of training. His safety
               requires The Voice.

                          PAUL
               I've heard enough of my safety... What
               about my father?... I heard you talking.
               You speak as if he was dead. Well, he
               isn't!

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She tries to hold him.

                          PAUL
               Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell
               me he won't die!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               What can be done has been done.

                          PAUL
               MOTHER! Tell me!

     The Reverend Mother covers herself and moves quickly
     to the door.

46.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     HOME PLANET OF HOUSE HARKONNEN - As seen from space,
     the black planet as we saw it in Paul's filmbook.

47.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The surface of the planet is a vast sea of black
     oil. A small cable car traverses high above the sea
     toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a
     rectangular box over 100 stories high. Before the
     city there are rows of huge black towering steel
     heads atop massive furnaces. SMOKE billows out of
     their mouths.

48.  INT. CABLE CAR - GIEDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the cable car stands PITER. In one hand he
     holds the cylinder with DUKE Leto's ring imprint.

                          PITER
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.
               It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts
               acquire speed -
               The lips acquire stains -
               The stains become a warning -
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.

48A. INT. GREEN PORCELAIN ROOM - GEIDI PRIME

     Somewhere in the interior of Geidi Prime, we are in
     a green porcelain room. Two large Harkonnen
     soldiers, using large hoses, are washing down the
     walls and floors of the room. WE MOVE DOWN into the
     water rushing along the floor towards troughs.
     Closer, WE SEE bits of flesh, hair, and blood.

49.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The car zooms past gigantic faces, and the furnaces
     far below ROAR with tremendous power. The city now
     looms gigantic and overpowering -- millions of
     electrical cables stretch off the top into dark
     energy taps above the city.
--
50.  INT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the city the cable car passes into a huge
     inner chamber filled with open-topped lime green
     porcelain rooms with tremendous electrical lines
     criss-crossing above.

52.  INT. BARON'S ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     In front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops
     and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and
     enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being
     treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body.
     The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the
     Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and
     sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some
     time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room.

                          PITER
               My Lord!

                          BARON
               Piter.

     Piter moves up to the Baron.

                          PITER
               The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon,
               Baron, and I have here your answer from
               Duke Leto.

                          BARON
               What does Leto say, Piter?

                          PITER
               He wishes to inform you that Vendetta --
               as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,
               the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He
               does not wish to meet or speak with you.

                          BARON
                    (swallowing; angry)
               I made my peace gesture... the forms of
               Kanly have been obeyed.

     He throws down the cylinder.

                          PITER
               As you instructed me, I have enlightened
               your nephews concerning my plan t...
--
                          BARON
               My plan!

                          PITER
               The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd,
               Rabban... go quietly... no other great
               house of the Landsraad must ever know of
               the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The
               entire Landsraad would turn against the
               Baron and the Emperor.

                         DOCTOR
               Put the pick in there Pete
               And turn it round real neat.

     His assistant does so.

     Rabban breaks open a squood (living food).  The
     squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the
     blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty
     container of tiny animal meat into the dark water
     trough running through the center of the room.
     Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter,
     holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white
     pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who
     is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to
     arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall
     opposite the Baron.

                          BARON
                    (as the Baron watches the boy)
               You're so beautiful my Baron
               Your skin, love to me
               Your diseases lovingly cared for
               For all eternity.

                          BARON
               I will have Arrakis back for myself... he
               who controls the Spice, controls the
               universe... and what Piter didn't tell you
               is we have control of someone who is very
               close to Duke Leto.  This person... this
               traitor... will be worth more to us than
               ten legions of Sardaukar.

                          FEYD
               Who is the traitor?

                          BARON
                    (laughs)
               I won't tell you who the traitor is or
               when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will
               die before these eyes and he'll know that
               it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who
               encompasses his doom.
--
     The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the
     wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the
     Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet
     in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats
     down under the giant, humming electrical tube light
     and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which
     drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink
     glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The
     Attendants stand completely still with fear.

     The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands
     petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as
     they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins
     SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug,
     located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped
     and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then
     the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS
     continue to roar.

52C. EXT. ATREIDES SHIP - CALADAN - DAY

     A DRUM CORPS pounds out a powerful cadence in front
     of a water and cannon show as the Duke, Paul and
     Jessica mount the steel stairs to their ship.  In
     the doorway, they turn back for a final look.

     The Duke places a hand on Paul's shoulder.  We see
     the signet ring.  Jessica is there.  She tries to
     get Paul to look at her but he scowls and turns to
     his father.

                         JESSICA
                    (turning away)
                    (inner voice)
               I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-
               killer... the little death that brings
               total obliteration...

     The door of the spaceship closes.

53.  EXT. HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     3,415 Atreides ships are approaching the Guild
     Heighliner, which is staggeringly colossal.  The
     Atreides ships look like dots next to the sun.  The
     Duke's ship enters the frame and moves toward the
     Heighliner.

     Paul, Jessica and Duke Leto look out the forward
     viewing glass as tiny lights move outside in the
     darkness. They hear and feel their ship stop with a
     huge, echoing, metallic jolt. They look at each
     other in the silence which follows.

                        DUKE LETO
               Soon they'll begin to fold space.

57.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     We pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot
     high control room filled with orange spice gas. On
     the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and
     filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being
     converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of
     machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a
     Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims
     through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional
     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe.
     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his
     mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and
     changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The
     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light
     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe.
     It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator
     begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the
     stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into
     the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins
     to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical
     lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the
     Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges
     deep into the light. The navigator swims to the
     point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull
     and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks
     and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a
     roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this
     hole through the rings of light. The Navigator
     becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost
     in darkness. The sounds fade.

     The engineers activate a series of atometric
     Holtzman generators. Suddenly SOUNDS begin. The

     series of levers are pulled.

     MOVING TROOPS are unpacking crates and organizing
     furnishings. Jessica watches them. Distant SOUNDS
     reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside
     them.

                        DR. YUEH
               Listen here.... You can here the people of
               Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry
               "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?

                         JESSICA
               So many reminders of the scarcity of
               water.

                        DR. YUEH
               Have you noticed the line of palms along
               the wall... the Harkonnen put them in...
               to flaunt their water wealth in front of
               these people.... Each day those palms take
               enough water to sustain the life of one
               hundred men.

                         JESSICA
               The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know
               you had so much reason to hate them.

               signs are al over him.... They must have
               killed here.

     Jessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on Yueh's
     cheek.

                        DR. YUEH
               I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.

     Above them a series of iron curtains begins to open
     over deep rock window slots, sending  narrow shafts
     of light down across the room. TWO ATREIDES WOMEN in
     uniform approach.

                    ATREIDES WOMAN #1
                    (referring to several robed figures
                    standing in the room)
               My lady... the local people... the maids
               and servants await your inspection. Hawat
               has cleared them.

     Dr. Yueh turns to Jessica.

                        DR. YUEH
               The Harkonnens may have tampered
               medically.... please wait.

     He turns a yellow light on a moves it over the
     crowd. The yellow light beam plays over the blue-
     within-blue eyes. One of the women, the Shadout
     Mapes, watches Jessica continuously. Yueh's hand
     shakes slightly.

                    (inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands)
               He's hiding something -- holding something
               back.
                    (She studies his face closely.)
               It's not just his wife... He's a good man
               though. He's probably trying to save my
               feelings...
                    (We see her mouth.)
               I could use The Voice... make him tell
               me... It would only shame him.
                    (We see her eyes.)
               I must place more trust in my friends.

     We SEE a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice
     harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a
     narrator speaks over.

                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One carryall handles four spice mining
               teams; however, it will fly only two
               harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine
               hundred and thirty harvesters and nine
               hundred and eighty-one carryalls....

78.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul looks up. Across the room he sees a tray of
     small pastries which have been laid out. He goes to
     them and scans them with his poison detector, which
     he carries on his belt. A pleasant tone SOUNDS and
     the word "safe" appears in green light. Paul takes a
     pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed.
     Suddenly he stops. He looks at the pastry.

     GLOWS brilliantly.

               Terrible purpose.... What is it?

               I am the Shadout Mapes... the housekeeper.

                          PAUL
               A Fremen... Could she be the operator?
               No...

                      SHADOUT MAPES
               I must cleanse the way between us.... You
               saved my life... and we  Fremen pay our
               debts. It's known to us that you've a
               traitor in your midst. Who it is we cannot
               say but we're certain of it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A traitor...

     Before he can speak the Shadout Mapes is gone --
     running off down the passageway. Jessica enters.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (looks to Jessica)
               There is a traitor among us.

     Thufir walks quickly toward SEVERAL TROOPS.

                         THUFIR
               Set up a sonar probe immediately!

     Dr. Yueh sticks his head out the doorway as SEVERAL
     TROOPERS run past.

84.  INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Duke Leto is calling on a radio phone. GENERALS
     surround him, as well as Gurney.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (on phone)
               Thufir?... anything?... keep looking.
                    (Inner voice)
               ...and a traitor... God help us.

85.  INT. SUB-SUB-SUB-BASEMENT - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     TROOPS come off an elevator. The glow-span indicates
     the very bottom floor of 18 sub-floors. The ground
     is uneven rock and the ceiling is low. The troops
     fan out shining chemical lamps here and there. A
     soldier suddenly stops. Ahead in his light is a dead
     Harkonnen -- bloody vomit dried around his mouth. He
     lies beside an electronic device.

86.  INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Dr. Yueh covers his face with his hands in a
     darkened room... sobbing.

86A. EXT. WALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     SEARCHLIGHTS sweep over the faces of City Fremen who
     are sitting or moving solemnly around the outer wall
     of the Palace. Some are chanting "Mahdi" and "Lisan
     al-Gaib." Others hold up one open hand as a sign
     they feel the messiah is near. A slow-moving spike-
     backed dog sucks ants up out of a small anthill; he
     snorts.

86B. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     In the darkened Hall we can HEAR the distant sound
     of the Fremen reverberating.

87.  INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Duke Leto sits with Paul, Thufir, EIGHT GENERALS and
     SIX SUB-LIEUTENANTS. The Duke's small dog wanders
     under the table and rests his head on the Duke's
     boot. In front of Thufir is a device FLASHING
     brilliant light bursts over his face. The others are
     all talking among themselves. Suddenly Thufir's face
     turns brilliant red (as red as his sapho-stained
     lips) and he begins speaking rapidly into the
     machine in code using a strained high voice.
--
                         THUFIR
                    (Mentat voice)
               Sector 6 - 80 -- copy the sixth -- the
               summit -- the eight the quadrant over the
               ninth plus eighty -- four circles -- weave
               the eighty and call the fourth copy --
               enter nine -- seven by seven a seven the
               seven call seven B seven -- enter the
               circles call the sixth copy the sixth over
               the summit.... eight.

     The machine FLASHES several bright irregular
     SIGNALS. Then it stops and HUMS. The blood leaves
     Thufir's face.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
                    (very fast and casually)
               Eight.... Thufir Hawat... Mentat... Master
               of Assassins.

     The hum stops. Thufir turns to Duke Leto. He looks
     up. Everyone is quiet now.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               The Palace is now secure. The city of
               Arrakeen is under martial law... we have
               troops here headquartered underground on
               sub-floors six through ten. The rest of
               the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and
               we have some on the airfield. Our new army
               is still training, but everything is
               shielded.... With the shielding, we are
               impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire,
               for your inspection of spice mining
               operations, but since the attempt of the
               young master, I am against your leaving
               the Palace.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (very angry)
               The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives
               have already been taken. We must crush the
               Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all
               know what to do.
                    (Turning towards Gurney)
               ...Gurney! We desperately need more spice
               miners... many are threatening to leave on
               the next shuttle. We need spice drivers,
               weather scanners, dune men ... any with
               open sand experience. You must persuade
               them to enlist with us.
--
                         GURNEY
               They shall come all for violence: their
               faces shall sup as the east wind. And they
               shall gather the captivity of the sand.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (squints at Gurney)
               Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and
               take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I
               arrive. We will not be prisoners here in
               this place.

                         GURNEY
                    (artfully easing the Duke's anger)
               Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I
               forth to my work.

     Gurney strides off. Thufir sits, contemplating. Paul
     and Duke Leto smile at each other and shake their
     heads.

88.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Jessica is sitting in a small room, smiling, reading
     a note. It reads "I miss you. Leto." She sets the
     note down. She begins to tremble. She becomes
     fearful. In her mind she SEES quick images:

               I must speak with you Leto!

91.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Outside in the passageway, feet suddenly move
     quietly toward the door to Jessica's room.

92.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Jessica HEARS this and looks up just as the Shadout
     Mapes silently enters her room.

                         JESSICA
                    (staring at the blue-eyed woman --
                    waiting for possible danger.)
               Yes?

                      SHADOUT MAPES
               I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper,
               Noble Born. What are your orders.

                         JESSICA
               You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not
               noble born. I'm the bound concubine of
               Duke Leto -- mother of the heir
               designate.... "Shadout"... that's an
               ancient word.

                          MAPES
                    (strangely asked)
               You know the ancient tongues?

                         JESSICA
               I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all
               the hunting languages.

                          MAPES
               As the legend says.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has
               been here planting protective legends
               against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And
               that day has come. I must play out this
               sham.
                    (out loud)
               I know the Dark things and the way of the
               Great Mother. Miseces prejin.

     Mapes takes a step backward to flee.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
               I know many things. I know you came
               prepared for violence with a weapon in
               your bodice.
--
                          MAPES
               My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a
               gift if you should prove to be the one.

                         JESSICA
               And the means of my death should I prove
               otherwise.
                    (inner voice)
               Now we will see which way the decision
               tips.

     Slowly Mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a
     sheathed knife. She unleashes it.

                          MAPES
               Do you know this my lady?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               It could only be one thing....
                    (out loud)
               It's a crysknife.

                          MAPES
               Say it not lightly...
                    (very slowly)
               Do you know its meaning?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Here is why this Fremen has taken service
               with me, to ask that one question. Delay
               is as dangerous as the wrong answer.
               Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa
               is... maker of death.
                    (out loud)
               It's a maker...

     Mapes SCREAMS with elation and grief.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               Maker?... Maker is the key word... the
               tooth of the worm? That was close...
                    (out loud)
               Did you think that I, knowing the
               mysteries of the Great Mother, would not
               know the maker?

                          MAPES
               My lady, when one has lived with prophecy
               for so long, the moment of revelation is a
               shock.

     Mapes sheathes the blade... slowly
--
                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               There's more here... yes!
                    (out loud)
               Mapes, you've sheathed that blade
               unblooded.

     With a GASP Mapes drops the knife into Jessica's
     hands and opens her blouse.

                          MAPES
               Take the water of my life!

     Jessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and,
     with the blade, scratches a line just above Mapes'
     right breast.

                     MAPES (CONT'D)
               You are ours.... You are the one.

     Jessica's eyes stare ahead. She knows these words
     ring with truth.

93.  INT. TUNNEL - OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
DAY

     The Duke, Paul and SEVERAL ARMED GUARDS enter a
     tunnel to a `thopter landing pad which is
     illuminated by a shaft of light coming from a
     chimney-like exit above. DR. KYNES and his Fremen
     guard are standing next to Gurney.

                          KYNES
                    (to Gurney)
               So, this is Leto the Just...

                         GURNEY
                    (sharply)
               I hope I made myself clear. You may call
               him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And
               there is a more ancient term you might
               keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               Play out your little comedy while you can
               off-worlders...

     Gurney turns and activates a device...

93A. INSERT - ORNITHOPTER OPENING

     ...which causes the ornithopter behind to fold open
     ready for flight.

93B. INT. TUNNEL - OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
DAY

     The two parties meet and are introduced.

                        DUKE LETO
               So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial
               Ecologist?

                          KYNES
                    (turning to Gurney)
               I prefer the more ancient term,
               planetologist... Noble Born.

                        DUKE LETO
               This is my son, Paul.

                          PAUL
               Are you a Fremen?

                          KYNES
               I am a servant of the His Majesty the
               Emperor. I have served His Majesty on
               Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               He's hiding something.

                        DUKE LETO
               I understand we have you to thank for
               these stillsuits, Doctor.

                          KYNES
               They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit
               well, my lord.

                          PAUL
               "Your gift is a blessing of the river."

     Kynes' FREMEN GUARDS, hearing this are siezed with
     agitation. Kynes QUIETS them, then studies Paul.

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               The Mahdi will greet you with holy words
               and your gifts will be a blessing.
                    (spoken, nonchalantly)
               Most of the desert natives here are a
               superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With
               your permission, I will check the security
               of your suits.

     Gurney and the guard move forward warily.

                         GURNEY
                    (angrily)
               The Duke is to be addresses as...
--
     Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit,
     checking seals and pulling on straps.

                          KYNES
               Basically...

                         GURNEY
                    (leaping forward to protect his Duke)
               Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               It's all right Gurney.

     Gurney steps back.

                         GURNEY
               Yes, Sire.

                          KYNES
               It's a high-efficiency filter and heat
               exchange system. Perspiration passes
               through the first layer and is gathered in
               the second. The salt is separated.
               Breathing and walking provide the pumping
               action. The reclaimed water circulates to
               catchpockets from which you can drink
               through this tube at your neck. Urine and
               feces are processed in the thigh pads.
               Should you be in the open desert, remember
               to breathe in through your mouth, out
               through the nose tubes.

     The Duke is now properly fitted. Kynes places the
     noseplug into his nose.

                     KYNES (CONT'D)
               With a Fremen suit in good working order,
               one can sustain life for weeks, even in
               the deep desert.

     He removes the noseplug.

                        DUKE LETO
               My thanks.

                          KYNES
               With your permission...

     Kynes turns to Paul, running his hands over the
     slick fabric. He stands back with a puzzled
     expression.

                          KYNES
               You've worn a stillsuit before?

                          PAUL
               No.

                          KYNES
     Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how
     to do that?

                          PAUL
               No one. It... seemed the proper way.

                          KYNES
               That it is.
                    (inner voice)
               He shall know your ways as if born to
               them.

     Kyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely
     now.

                         GURNEY
               We're wasting time, Sire.

     Duke Leto, Dr. Kynes, Gurney and Paul enter the
     ornithopter...

     From outside the Palace's atomic shield we see the

     come out perfect like a gleaming jewel.

               Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's
               where I told your sandmaster to
               concentrate his harvesting.

95.  EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     They crest the top of the wall which opens out into
     a black, level expanse of rock, cratered and
     fractured. On the other side is the huge, seemingly
     endless plain of sand, the Great Desert. In the hazy
     distance, flashes of light can be seen.

96.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                          PAUL
               Will we see a worm?

                          KYNES
               Where there is spice and spice mining
               there are always worms.

                          PAUL
               Always?

                          KYNES
               Always.

                          PAUL
               Why do they come?

                          KYNES
               To protect their territory. Vibrations
               attract them.
--
                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I've registered him now... a knife is a
               sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a
               person born to command... He's hiding many
               things.
                    (out loud, suddenly)
               Is there a relationship between the worms
               and the spice?

     Kynes turns instantly and stares at Paul. Gurney
     sees the wonder in Kynes' eyes.

                         GURNEY
               The young master is a trained Mentat, an
               advanced student of Prana Bindu has
               studied under some of the finest teachers
               in the Universe.

     Kynes takes a second look at young Paul.

                          KYNES
               As I said... they defend the spice sands.
               As to their relationship with the spice...
               who knows.

               Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

                          KYNES
               That's it... spice mining... no other
               cloud quite like it. See the spotters over
               it? They're watching for wormsign... the
               telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the
               surface, too Sire... worms can travel too
               deep for their waves to show... Looks like
               a good patch of spice.

                        DUKE LETO
               Wormsign? Is it wormsign?
--
                          KYNES
               Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp
               eyes Sire.... May I?

     Kynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct
     frequency.

100. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER

     From the window, we see that the sand below is
     rippling, like water with a big fish just under the
     surface.

                          KYNES
                    (into radio, after having found the
                    frequency)
               Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign!

          STATIC... then a voice.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Who calls Pad Nine?

                         GURNEY
                    (quickly)
               Don't mention the Duke... This is an
               uncoded channel.

                          KYNES
               Unlisted flight northeast of you...
               wormsign on intercept course... estimated
               contact fifteen minutes.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix.
               Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very
               precise estimate. Who is on that unlisted
               flight?

     Kynes clicks off the radio.

                        DUKE LETO
               What happens now?

                          KYNES
               The carryall will come and lift off the
               spice harvester. Try and get in close over
               the harvester... you'll find this
               interesting Sire.
--
     The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the
     direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...

101. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     ...huge amounts of sand being spewn out of the
     gigantic stack atop the metal and plasteel
     harvester.

102. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                          KYNES
               They'll work until the very last minute.

     The yellow cloud of the harvester envelops them. The
     Duke flies up to get a closer look.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Spotter control... no sign of the
               carryall... it isn't answering.

     Everyone looks at one another.

                         GURNEY
               The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Spotter control -- give me a report by the
               numbers.

     Over the radio MANY VOICES report they have no
     contact with the carryall.

                        DUKE LETO
               Damn it... Harkonnens.

     He punches a control button and grabs a microphone.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (into microphone)
               We are coming down to take you off the
               harvester... All spotters are ordered to
               comply.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Ordered by whom?
--
                        DUKE LETO
                    (angrily)
               Duke Leto Atreides....

     Gurney and Paul turn to each other, worried.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Yes... yes, Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               How many men do you have?

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire,
               we can't leave this spice...

                        DUKE LETO
               Damn the spice! Get out of there.

103. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     All the spotters begin landing and the Duke descends
     directly in front of the harvester which has stopped
     mining yet emits a tremendous rythmic GRINDING
     noise. No one is coming out.

104. INT./EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER/DESERT - DAY

     Gurney nervously scans the sky for enemy ships. A
     very low, powerful SOUND starts now and the ground
     begins to shake.

105. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     A hatch opens and MEN come pouring out.

106. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - DAY

                        DUKE LETO
                    (yelling at the men)
               Two men in each of the spotters... You!...
               over here... run!!

     The ground is really shaking now.  A tremendous low
     THUNDERING sound grows along with a high rasping
     HISS.

                          KYNES
                    (to Paul and Gurney -- yelling over
                    the noise)
               I can't see him yet but he's very close...
--
                        DUKE LETO
                    (out loud to himself as he watches
                    the men scrambling)
               Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy.

     FOUR MEN begin tumbling into the Duke's machine.

                         GURNEY
               Come on boys... come on.
                    (Then, to the Duke)
               We're going to be heavy, Sire.

     The men press on Gurney and Paul.  Paul can feel the
     fear. The sound is a horrible ROAR and deeper
     RUMBLING now and the `thopter is vibrating and
     shaking violently.  The air suddenly begins to SPARK
     with static electricity.

                          KYNES
                    (nervous)
               Here he is... We've got to go.

     The Duke closes the doorways, surveys the area one
     last time, then takes the controls.

106A.     INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     The ship strains and lifts off -- slowly.

     Paul sees the brown powder clumped on the suits of
     the men... their bluish eyes.  He smells the spice.
     He begins to feel its affect.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice as a blinding light
                    comes and goes)
               Spice!... pure un-refined spice!

                          KYNES
                    (murmuring)
               Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the
               coming and going of him.  May his passage
               cleanse the world.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (yelling)
               What's that you're saying?

                          KYNES
               Nothing.

     A spice miner turns and sees Kynes, who remains
     silent.

                     SPICE MINER #1
                    (astonished)
               Liet!

                     SPICE MINER #2
               Shhhhh.

     Paul hears this, then looks to Kynes -- locks on his
     image.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Liet?

                          KYNES
                    (pointing down and yelling)
               You are about to witness something few
               have seen -- watch!  Watch!

     Paul looks down as the Duke banks over the
     harvester.

107. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

Static electricity is IGNITING in the air and the sand is
swirling around the harvester.  Then they see it.  A wide
hole emerges from the sand, glistening spokes within it.
The hole is twice the size of the harvester.  Suddenly
the machine turns and slides into the hole, parts of it
EXPLODING.  The SOUND is deafening.  The Duke's ship is
WHINING to stay aloft.

               Someone is going to pay for this... I
               promise.

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice -- as he studies the
                    Duke)
               This Duke is more concerned over his men
               than the spice!  I must admit... against
               all better judgement... I like this Duke.

     Duke Leto walks into the room.  The NIGHT GUARD
     comes to attention as he passes.  DUNCAN IDAHO,
     wearing a dark, dusty stillsuit, emerges from the
     shadows.  DUKE LETO and DUNCAN meet at the foot of
     the steps.  The men embrace and separate.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (happily)
               Duncan!  What have you discovered about
               the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why
               haven't we heard from you?

                         DUNCAN
               My lord... I suspect so much.  I think
               they are the allies we seek... they are
               strong and fierce... they do not give
               their loyalty easily or quickly....  As
               you know, the Imperium has never been able
               to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone
               thinks that there are but few -- wandering
               here and there in the desert.... My lord,
               I suspect an incredible secret has been
               kept on this planet... that the Fremen
               exist in vast numbers... vast numbers...
               and it is they that control Arrakis.

     The Duke smiles at Paul then leaves the room, but

     The BARON's face --  expressionless.  The SOUND of
     his ship screams in the background.  The DOCTOR is
     seated beside him.

118  INT. SUB-BASEMENT PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
NIGHT

     The Duke walks down the steps to a very narrow
     passageway.  The passageway becomes very dark.

     Suddenly the Duke hears a strange MEWLING sound.  He
     turns down an even darker passageway.  He can hear
     the shield WHINING in the distance.  He almost has
     to feel his way.  Up ahead he sees a shape.  He
     bends down and sees the SHADOUT MAPES dying on the
     cold stone floor in the darkness.  She tries to
     speak but cannot.  She falls.  Suddenly the Duke
     HEARS the shield generator start whining down.

                        DUKE LETO
               What happened?  What?
                    (as Mapes dies)
               The shield!

     The Duke reaches to activate his shield be a large
     dart is shot into his shoulder.  The Duke lurches
     upwards then tumbles to the ground.  Out of the
     darkness comes Dr. Yueh.  The dart drops and
     CLATTERS as if a dream.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (mind racing -- struggling)
               Yueh!
                    (inner voice)
               He's sabotaged the house generators, we're
               wide open.

                    (with self-disgust)
               I've brought House Atreides down.  I've
               destroyed the new army's weirding modules.

               I wish to kill a man... not you, my dear
               Duke, but the Baron....  You were dead
               already... but you will be close to the
               Baron before you die.  You will be tied
               and drugged but you can still attack.
               When you see the Baron you will have a new
               poison tooth.  He will want you close so
               he can gloat over you.  One bite on this
               tooth and a strong exile...

                        DUKE LETO
               Refuse...

                          YUEH
               No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will
               save the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

     Yueh removes the Duke's signet ring and shows it to
     him.

                      YUEH (CONT'D)
               For Paul...

     He implants the tooth.

     Yueh becomes more and more blurred.  His image
     begins to fade.  His lips move in the darkness.  The
     generator WHINE is low and going lower and lower.

               When you see the Baron, remember the
               tooth!  The tooth!

     through bodies and thick smoke.  Gurney has the

     The soldiers disappear, searching in another

     Suddenly twelve huge Sardaukar round a corner on a
     quick march.  Duncan turns his shield up and charges
     them.  Behind them he sees Paul and Jessica bound in
     straps and being carried.

     Duncan attacks and fights valiantly but he is
     outnumbered.  In the fight the lights are blown out
     and Duncan is killed by a slow stunner pellet
     through the head.  Paul strains to help.

                          BARON
                    (to Yueh - quietly)
               You wish now to join your wife, is that
               it, traitor?

     A sudden flash of hope crosses Yueh's face.

                          YUEH
               She lives?

     The Baron smiles, almost sympathetically.

                          BARON
               You wish to join her... join her, then.

     Piter moves to Yueh, a knife glistening in his hand.
     It flashes into his back.  A GASP escapes Yueh's
     throat, a sad look passing over his face, as if to
     say "I thought as much."  He stands stiffly, then
     falls gasping.  He tastes his own blood, then dies.

                          BARON

     Jessica and Paul, bound by cabin straps, lie in the
     back, the two guards at the controls.  Outside,
     `thopters and ships fly past them toward the city.
     The distant FIRES play over Jessica's face as she
     sees Yueh's triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin
     roof.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               I'd like to have some fun before we kill
               her.

               Don't touch my mother...

               Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice.
               The Reverend Mother said it could save
               him.

               No?

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #2
               No.

     He turns and hits Paul in the shoulder with a
     stungun.  Paul recovers and starts taking long,
     calming breaths.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               The calming exercise.

               The little one!
                    (they laugh)

     Suddenly, Guard #1 reaches around and puts his hand
     up Jessica's skirt.  He starts breathing hard.  Paul
     clears his throat.

                          PAUL
                    (using The Voice)
               Remove her gag!

                    (inner voice)
               Excellent!

     Guard #1 finds himself removing Jessica's gag.
     Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems
     powerless to stop him.  Once, it's off Jessica
     smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter
     floor.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               There's no need to fight over me.

     The two men stare at one another a moment.  Then
     Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard
     #2's chest, killing him.  Guard #1 pulls the knife
     out, smiling.  The ornithopter begins to veer off
     into a dangerous nose dive.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               Now?

                         JESSICA

               First cut my son's bonds.

     Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking
     his eyes off Jessica.  The ornithopter gets closer
     and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield
     Wall.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               That's it.

     The blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's
     legs.  Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and
     his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and
     drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out
     the man's mouth.  Paul grabs the controls but it's
     too late.  The ship falls into the rock.

130A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter slides across the rock, shearing off a

     above the great desert and plummeting fast toward
     the dunes below.

     Paul pulls desperately on the controls and manages
     to keep the ship aloft and flying into the deep

               Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the

               It was Feyd.

     Leto's POV:  The Baron and his Mentat are only DIM
     FARAWAY SHAPES.  Their voices reach Leto as if
     travelling across a greater distance.  The Baron
     looks to Leto and then moves to him, looking him
     over.

                          BARON
               It was Feyd?
                    (laughing)
               It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet
               ring?  I must have his ring.

                          PITER
               The ring?... he was brought to us as is,
               Baron.  I...

                          PITER
               He's coming round, my Lord.

     The Baron moves from behind a table stacked with
     dirty dishes and foodstuffs and goes to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (inner voice)
               Wait... he must be near...

                          BARON
               Where is your ring?

     The Baron's face is now very close to Duke Leto's.

                     BARON (CONT'D)
               You do not answer!

                        DUKE LETO
                    (very faint)
               A... little... closer....  The... water...
               of my life... for Paul.

     The Baron briefly wonders at these words and then
     turns to Piter.

                          BARON
               He's crying!
                    (he hits Duke Leto)
               He's crying!  He's crying, Piter.  What
               does he mean?

     Piter moves forward.  The Baron sees a suculent
     piece of chicken skin on the table.  He picks up the
     plate, then the chicken skin.

     Leto's POV:  It's grown HAZY again.  The Baron is
     beginning to move away, reaching for the small piece
     of chicken skin.  Piter leans close to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
               Now!

     We hear a CRUNCH, hear a tumultuous RUSHING SOUND as
     Piter's face is pushed forcibly away.  The Baron is
     turning, a dumbfounded look on his face.  He drops
     the plate, and backs away.

     There is a tremendous ROARING.  Bits of visions of
     Caladan rush through Leto's ever-darkening
     consciousness --

     shuddering and straining, Jessica suddenly cries out
     with tremendous premonition and fear.

                         JESSICA
               Leto!  Leto!

     Tears course down her cheeks as Paul turns to her.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (to Paul)
               Leto!  He's dead!  He's dead...
--
                          PAUL
               I know
                    (inner voice)
               I have NO FEELINGS!!  Why?

136. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     Duke Leto and Piter lie dead.

137. INT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     The Baron floats near the ceiling in a small
     passageway.  He is ecstatic.

                          BARON
                    (screaming)
               I'm alive!!!  I'm alive!!!

137A.     INT. HARKONNEN `THOPTER - NIGHT

     Paul is fighting the controls of the Harkonnen
     `thopter.

137B.     CLEAN POV

     Harkonnen `thopter lights on dunes.

137A.     BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               I can't maintain any altitude... we'll
               never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe
               that small rock.

                         JESSICA
               Where are we do you think?

                          PAUL
               The South Polar regions... the forbidden
               area.  We must make it to that rock...

137C.     EXT. HARKONNEN `THOPTER - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter violently hits the sands and flips up -
     - almost turning over.  It falls slowly back,  then
     slides down the side of a dune.

137D.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
               Hurry!

     He jumps out of his seat.

                         JESSICA
               Bring these satchels!

     She hands him one.

                          PAUL
                    (at doorway)
               Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm.

     As Paul puts the satchel over his shoulder, he feels
     something.  He looks at his father's ring.  He
     stares at it silently, then closes his hand around
     it.  They jump outside.

                         JESSICA
                    (starting to cry)
               A million deaths are not enough for
               Yueh...

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(reacting to his
                    mother's tears)
               Where are my feelings... I feel for no
               one...

138. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica running.  Paul pulls Jessica to a
     place in the wall where a small overhang offers
     shelter.  Jessica falls to the ground.  She CRIES,
     pouring out her grief, but soon the sound of it is
     carried away by the building rush of WIND.  Paul
     turns and looks out to the open desert, this portion
     of which is a dust ocean.

138A.     PAUL'S POV:

     The Mouse Moon has risen.

     Ripples of dust undulate tide-like in the light of
     the moon.  The WHISPERING grains billow up like the
     foam of waves as they hit the rock.

138. BACK TO SCENE

     Paul turns, his face illuminated by the two moons
     above.  His eyes lock on the moon which has the
     image of the mouse.
--
                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The second moon... from the dreams...

138B.     INT. PAUL'S EYE - NIGHT

     We move into Paul's eye, where the mouse moon appear
     and revolves slowly.  The moon begins to explode.
     The pieces of the moon soar toward us burning with
     white-hot flames.  Within the flames we see...

139. (Deleted)

139A.     EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     ... the burning Palace of Arrakeen.  We move closer
     to it.

189B.     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     We then see Duke Leto's face.  The Baron leans over
     the Duke and clutches the skin on the Duke's face.
     He begins pulling it.  The skin on the Duke's race
     slowly rips open -- making a hideous tearing SOUND.
     Black SMOKE issues forth from the hole which teats
     larger.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (distorted)
               House Atreides is ruined.
                    (less distorted)
               This moon holds my past.

139C.     INT. VESTIBULE - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Inside and through the SMOKE Paul sees Feyd tear the
     Red Duke insignia off his father's uniform.  He sees
     Feyd laughing.  The moving, now-brilliant red hawk
     insignia becomes...

139D.     EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     ... a burning meteor ROARING over the castle on
     Caladan.  The meteor crashes in the black sea.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               This moon holds my future.
--
139E.     INT. WATER - NIGHT

     Foaming confusion turning into a small, twisting
     fetus under the sea.  Its eyes closed.  Moving close
     to it, its eyes snap open.  Through the eyes is the
     pale white face of JESSICA.

139F.     EXT. SHIELD WALL - DESERT - NIGHT

     There is a huge soaring WIND sound and beyond
     JESSICA the dunes roll like ocean waves.

139G.     EXT. MOUSE MOON - NIGHT

     The moon continues to spew out pieces of moving
     images which are seen then disappear as fast as
     sparks.  The broken, burning pieces float eerily
     toward us over the undulating dunes below.  One
     image floats closer.  It is a hand folded into a
     fist.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               I am only a seed...

     The fist begins to open.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The seed must grow.

     The hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating
     out the very center of the palm.  The hand floats
     eerily forward.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The sleeper must awaken.

139H.     EXT. WATER - NIGHT

     The last image which passes is foaming and spitting
     dark blue water.  As the image passes, the black
     smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to
     blackness.

140. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Through the darkness we move to Paul's clenched
     hand.  It opens, revealing the signet ring in the
     very center of his palm.  Paul looks upward to the
     moons of Arrakis.  He looks back to the ring, then
     to his mother.

                          PAUL
               Listen to me!... you wanted to know about
               my dreams... and I've just had a waking
               dream... do you know why?...
--
                         JESSICA
               Calm yourself/

                          PAUL
               The spice!  It's in everything here.  The
               air, the soil, the food...  It's like the
               Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!!
               You knew the spice would change me.  But
               thanks to your teachings it's changed my
               consciousness.  I can see it... I can see
               it.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Is he....?

                          PAUL
               You carry my unborn sister in your womb!

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               He knows.

                          PAUL
               You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood...
               I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm
               something different, something unexpected!
                    (inner voice)
               I'm a seed.
                    (out load)

               know me...

141. through 142A.  (Deleted)

142B.     EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul's head goes down.  He places the ring on his
     finger.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Father... now I have become a killer and I
               will continue to kill until I have avenged
               your death.
                    (out loud)
               Father!

     Jessica cries as she stares at her son.

145. BACK TO SCENE

     Rabban stops up the ramp.  He wears a large smile.
     His thick head sweats and sweat runs down his thick
     neck.  He goes inside and the doors swing closed.

146. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     He enters the ship and moves down within to the
     Baron's headquarters, passing two dwarves cooking a
     dead legless cow which hangs from chains.  Rabban
     tears out the cow's tongue and eats it.  Then he
     exits through a door which closes behind him.

147. INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     The Baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of
     a large steel shower, while Nefud and a DWARF play a
     strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse,
     screaming MUSIC.  The Baron SEES Rabban enter, but
     continues to fly around the shower.

                          BARON
                    (very excited)
               Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides
               blood!  We've gutted them.  We've gutted
               them!
                    (laughs)

     The Baron floats to Rabban and begins lovingly
     massaging Rabban's massive neck as he speaks to him.

                          BARON
               Rabban, Rabban...  I place you in charge
               of Arrakis.  It's yours to squeeze, as I
               promised.  I want you to squeeze and
               squeeze and squeeze.
                    (massaging in rhythm)
               Give me spice!  Drive them into utter
               submission.  You must not show the
               slightest pity or mercy... as only you
               can...  Never stop!
                    (releasing him)
               Go....  Show no mercy!

                         RABBAN
               Yes, my lord Baron.

     Rabban leaves just as Feyd steps out of the shower.
     The Baron turns to him lovingly.
--
                          BARON
                    (to Feyd)
               And when we've crushed these people enough
               I'll send in you Feyd... they'll cheer you
               as a rescuer... lovely Feyd... really a
               lovely boy.
                    (suddenly he smiles and screams)
               Where's my doctor?

148. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     As Rabban leaves, he looks into one room of the
     ship.  Behind the glass porthole sits Thufir Hawat
     bound head and foot, his eyes darting this way and
     that.

148A.     EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica are in stillsuits.  Paul is looking
     through a Fremkit.  He finds a paper with Dr. Yueh's
     mark on it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh's left the plans for the weirding
               modules.

148B.     EXT. MOONS - ARRAKEEN - DESERT - NIGHT

     The moons have moved further across the sky.

148A.     BACK TO SCENE

     Suddenly Paul turns and studies his mother.  A
     stronger WIND comes up.

                          PAUL
               We have to get to that mountain of rock.
               We have entered the time when all will
               turn against us and seek our lives...

     Jessica gets up.  They make their way up the crest
     of a dune by a small rock.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               It's further than I thought... a worm is
               sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper,
               that should divert it.
--
     Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica
     SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of
     rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)(as Paul leaves to light
                    the thumper)
               ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into
               tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...

149. through 151.   (Deleted)

151A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul plants the thumper which begins a powerful
     rhythmic noise.  He turns to Jessica.

                          PAUL
                    (returning)
               Remember... walk without rhythm and we
               won't attract a worm... it'll go to the
               thumper.

                         JESSICA
                    (puts in her noseplug)
               I'm ready.

     Paul and Jessica move into camera and exit right.

151B.     EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT

     Another burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems
     to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to
     ache.  Suddenly they HEAR the thumper start behind
     them.

                          PAUL
               Keep going...

152. EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER)

     Their breathing becomes very labored.  The sand
     moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up.
     Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS
     shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops.
     Paul turns.

                          PAUL
               Faster!!
--
                         JESSICA
                    (screaming)
               It's deafening!

     Their bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet
     the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm
     SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look.

153. EXT. WORM - DESERT - NIGHT

     A flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward
     them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous
     and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed.
     The power of this worm is awesome.

153A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (screaming)
               Run!

                         JESSICA
               I can't... I can't.

     She turns to see.  Then she runs.

153B.     EXT. DRUM SAND - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand.
     The SOUND is very loud.

                          PAUL
               Drum sand!

     The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground.
     Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They
     run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud.
     Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white
     LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they
     find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm
     changes.  They turn.

154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking
     through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an
     eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth
     arches forward searching for them.

155. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow
     slit of rock.
--
155A.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot
     penetrate the narrow opening in the rock.

156. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of
     hundred feet.

156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     Still the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the
     worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS
     drive through the black stone.  Over and over again
     the worm mindlessly hits at the rock.

156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny
     passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock
     prevents them from moving back any more.

156C.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     The breath from the worm is like a hurricane of
     WIND.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Cinnamon... the spice!
                    (out loud)
               Do you smell it?

                         JESSICA
               Yes...

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I know the secret.  The worm is the
               spice... the spice is the worm.

157. (Deleted)

157A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Suddenly a colossal section of the rock wall cracks
     and topples off into the worm's mouth.  Instantly
     the worm pulls back.  A huge FIRE roars deep within
     the worm consuming the rock.
--
158. INT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm now can get even closer to Paul and
     Jessica.  It looms up again and crushes its mouth up
     against the rock.

158A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Another fissure opens, and suddenly half the rock
     wall protecting them splits off entirely and
     falls... taking Paul with it.

158B.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     ...against the worm.

159. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight
     down two hundred feet.  His feet skid along the face
     of rock.  He bounces and brakes.  He hits and jumps.
     He careens from one boulder, flies upside down,
     rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand.
     Unhurt, he jumps up and scrambles up another part of
     the rock to safety.

160. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She presses against the narrow ledge that is left
     after the worm assault.

161. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm is just coming up again when distant
     THUMPING is heard.  The worm, as if charmed by the
     sound, turns and moves off towards it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A thumper.

162. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Jessica climbs further up and manages to get over to
     a place where she can meet up with Paul, who is now
     climbing back.
--
                         JESSICA
                    (crying)
               What's happened?...  Why did it leave?

                          PAUL
                    (breathing heavily)
               Someone started another thumper....  We're
               not alone.

     They climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth
     of a dark crevice.  Paul and Jessica try to see into
     the inky black hole.

163. EXT. CREVICE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Slowly Paul and Jessica enter, inching forward.  A
     low moan of WIND comes up.  Paul can see nothing,
     then suddenly he SEES stars above and SEES the hint
     of stairs cut into the rock.

                         JESSICA
                    (whispering)
               Man-carved steps.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               Yes...

     They climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow
     dark channel of stone.  As they make their way
     through the rock, suddenly there is a burst of
     lightning which illuminates a whole troop of Fremen
     standing silently in front of them.

164. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
               Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us
               of.

                         STILGAR
                    (to Jessica)
               Are you trained in the ways of the desert?

                         JESSICA
               No, but many consider my training
               valuable.

                         STILGAR
               I will take the boy-man... he shall have
               sanctuary in my tribe...
--
     A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the
     Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and
     just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon,
     Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls
     again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar
     helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat.
     Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky
     incline.

165. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     He then jumps higher up and presses himself between
     two rocks on a low cliff overlooking the rest of the
     Fremen troop.

166. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The troop starts shooting projectile weapons in
     Paul's direction.

                         STILGAR
               Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding
               way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great
               gods... if you can do this to the
               strongest of us you're worth ten times
               your weight of water.  As a leader of my
               people I give you my bond: teach us this
               weirding way and you both shall have
               sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with
               our water.

                         JESSICA
               Then I will teach you our way of
               battle....  you have the word bond of a
               Bene Gesserit.

                        A FREMEN
               It is the legend.

167. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Up on the rock, Paul turns.  He takes a step, then
     notices a small figure standing in front of him.  It
     is a girl.

                          CHANI
               I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would
               not have permitted you to harm my tribe.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet....
               is this Kynes' daughter?

     Paul stares at her in wonder.
--
                          CHANI
               Come with me.  I'll show you an easier way
               down.

     They exit.

168. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
                    (to Paul, as they meet)
               You have strength... real strength... You
               shall be known as Usul, which is the
               strength of the base of the pillar.  This
               is your secret name in our troop.  But you
               must choose the name of manhood which we
               will call you openly.

                          PAUL
                    (thinking)
               What do you call the mouse shadow in the
               second moon?

                         STILGAR
               We call that one Muad'dib.

                          PAUL
               Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?

                         STILGAR
               You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother
               shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We
               welcome you.

     Wind blows a cloud of dust through the rock.  High
     above the moon with the mouse shadow glows
     brilliantly.  It dissolves into the sun.

168A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Paul, Jessica and the Fremen march through the
     dunes.

171. through 171B.  (Deleted)

172. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DUSK/SUNSET

     HEAT WAVES and sand dunes.  Mysterious SOUNDS echo
     in the distance as the giant sun is setting.

     Chani takes Paul to the top of a dune.  They stare
     at the sunset and a huge rock outcropping in the
     distance.

                          CHANI
               Seitch Tabr.

     Paul looks at the rock, then turns to her.

                     CHANI (CONT'D)
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

     These words rend Paul's soul.  He cannot speak.  He
     reaches out and touches her hand - her cheek.

174. INT. ENTRANCE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The Fremen troop enters into a large square room
     with slot passageways going off in various
     directions.

175. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     They all move down one of the passageways which are
     beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns.  They
     are like passages in the pyramids, dark with sharp
     turns and inclines upwards or downwards, some very
     steep and long, and others descending hundreds of
     feet.  There is a strong, moaning WIND.

176. through 177.   (Deleted)

178. INT. PASSAGEWAY/STAIRS - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A quiet WIND can be heard -- deep and moaning.

                         JESSICA
               Moisture...

     She looks at Paul.  He, too, notices.

                          PAUL
               Wind traps... huge ones.

     Down a long, sloping, narrow passageway they go
     until they reach a stairway cut into the stone.  It
     is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they
     descend.  The WIND sound grows.  The air grows
     colder and damper.  Paul and Jessica share another
     questioning look.  At the bottom of the stairs they
     pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly
     opens out on something so totally unexpected it
     shocks Paul.
--
179. INT. RESERVOIR  -SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     It is enormous, deep reservoir of black water
     sitting silently in the depths of this sietch and
     stretching out into the darkness.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Water on Arrakis!!!
               I have seen this place in a dream.
                    (out loud)
               A treasure.

                         STILGAR
               Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have
               thousands of such caches.  Only a few of
               us know them all.  When we have enough...
               we shall change the face of Arrakis.
               Listen!...

     There is the sound of water dripping.  The lights
     are extinguished - reflections play on Paul's face.

                    STILGAR (CONT'D)
               The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets.

179A. through 180   (Deleted)

180A.     REVISED SCENE - HALL OF RITES

     Thousands of Fremen wait below.  Paul enters a rock
     ledge, guided by two monks, which is crowded with
     Fremen and old Fremen Monks.  Below the crowds
     continue to watch and wait while a giant wind organ
     moans.  A Monk steps up to Paul.

                          MONK
               We sense that you may be the "voice from
               the outer world".  Both moons told us of
               you.  You must pass tests before we will
               know... you must conquer the beast of the
               desert, both his outer and his deadly
               inner powers.
                    (moves back)
               Speak to us... from the outer world.

     Paul turns and gathers courage to address the
     multitude below.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I am only a seed.
                    (out loud)
               I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib.

                    (loud murmur)
               Muad'dib!

                          MONK
               The legend.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               No one ever dreamed there would be so
               many.
                    (out loud)
               Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once
               again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar,
               your leader, has asked me and my mother to
               crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more
               than this.  We must totally destroy all
               spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild
               and the entire universe depends on spice.

               "He who can destroy a thing, controls a
               thing".

               I will take one hundred of your warriors
               and train them.  This one hundred will
               train the thousands that remain.  When the
               spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to
               Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor
               himself will be forced to deal with us.
               Arrakis will become the center of the
               Universe.

182. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - DAY

     Large room with a low ceiling.  A drummer playing
     makes a low ECHOING MUSICAL HIT.  A big block of
     stone is moved across coarse sand -- back and forth
     -- fast.  A rhythm is started -- powerful.  Paul
     enters, pauses and looks to Jessica - he stands in
     front of over 100 Fremen men.  Jessica sits behind
     him alongside Stilgar.

     A large rock obelisk has been placed near Paul for
     this demonstration.

                          PAUL
               The weirding way has long been a Bene
               Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help,
               my father isolated an element of the
               weirding way and externalised it.
--
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
               Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my
               father's armies were never able to fully
               develop this new form.  This is what I
               will teach you.  You will be the fiercest
               and most feared fighters in the Universe.

               Our way of battle is built on rhythm.  You
               understand rhythm like this but you do not
               yet understand the rhythm of the higher
               sounds, sounds that heal and build...
               sounds that destroy.  Motion is the base.
               You understand the motion... but you do
               not yet understand the motion that heals
               and builds... motions that destroy...

               Orato!
                    (he moves forward)
               This obelisk is of your hardest stone.
               Kick it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Hit it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Yell at it...

                          ORATO
               Break!

     The Fremen laugh -- the rock doesn't move.

     A Fremen with a lasgun tries to cut it.  Paul
     motions him back, slightly.

                          PAUL
               Move back!

     Paul also moves back.  He switches on his weirding
     module.  He opens his mouth and makes a small SOUND,
     which the module amplifies.

                          PAUL
               Chuksa!

     The sound shatters the obelisk to pieces.  The one
     hundred Fremen YELL with surprise and awe.

                       100 FREMEN
               Achiii!
--
                          PAUL
               This is part of the weirding way that we
               will teach you.  Some thoughts have a
               certain sound... that being the equivalent
               to a form.  Through sound and motion you
               will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter
               bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or
               burst his organs....  We will kill until
               no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

                       100 FREMEN
               Muad'dib!

                    (inner voice)
               To avenge my father, I will turn you into
               killing machines.

     Stilgar turns to Jessica.

                         STILGAR
               Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me
               she is too old... She has been calling
               through space and time for you to come and
               let her rest.  She asks that you pass
               within.

               yet... we must move swiftly if we're to
               secure our place among these Fremen.
                    (out loud)
               I will try to pass within.

                         STILGAR
               Death may be the result....  Are you sure?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               I must do this for Paul, but what of my

188. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Fremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in
     on a litter.  The old Reverend Mother is old a frail
     yet extremely beautiful and mysterious.  She turns
     to Paul and Jessica with a strange look.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
                    (to Jessica, in an ancient voice)
               So you are the ones.

     She turns away towards the monks who are very busy
     blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice,
     purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow
     on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting
     chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low
     notes below.

     Paul looks to his mother.

     He then sees Chani.

     CU Chani.

     CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her.

     Stilgar motions to Paul.

                         STILGAR
                    (whispering to Paul)
               Do you know the Water of Life?... Come...
               ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries...
               the end and the beginning.

     He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost
     a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through
     an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very
     strange and somewhat horrifying scene.

189. INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a
     stone chamber.  The chamber is then covered with a
     wire top.  Valves are turned and water rushes into
     the chamber.  The worm begins to writhe violently
     and leap and bang against the bars above.  The worm
     begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it
     begins to gag.  Some monks and watermasters quickly
     drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out
     using large steel hooks.  They hold the worm above a
     large tub.  A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed
     in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a
     beautiful deep blue bile as it dies.

189A.     INT. MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial
     containers.  Paul turns to Stilgar.

                    (inner voice)
               The most lethal poison in the Universe.

     Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation
     with the Reverend Mother:

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               ... Many men have tried.

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died.

190. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Stilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall
     of Rites.  A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses
     the crowd, silencing them.  The other monks move
     back carrying their smoking cleansing bags.

                         MONK #1
               One among us has consented to enter the
               rite.  She will attempt to pass within
               that we not lose the strength of our
               Reverend Mother.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(turning to his mother)
               What if she should fail?

     He brings the jug close to Jessica.

                         MONK #1
               Drink!

     Jessica drinks.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic.
               I must transform the poison configuration
               within my body... the blue must be made
               clean.

     She swallows.  Her body contorts and spasms
     violently.  She screams.  The Reverend Mother
     screams with her.

     The old Reverend Mother slowly extends a hand toward
     Jessica's shoulder.

195. JESSICA - MENTAL IMAGE

     Inside Jessica, we see the Reverend Mother Ramallo's
     hand descend through the dark void.  Shimmering
     water starts to ripple, lightly stirring an image of
     Jessica.

     As the hand penetrates, something deep within her
     starts to GLOW.  It is a fetus, a female.  The
     Reverend Mother Ramallo's hand flinches as it
     touches the fetus.  The fetus sparks to life -
     screaming and rapidly spasming upwards on its
     umbilical cord.

               You should have told us.

             REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (V.O.)
                    (gasping)
               Great Mother!  This changes both!  What
               have we done?
--
197A.     INT. THE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     Jessica and the fetus rush mentally through a dark
     strangely worm-like tunnel until suddenly, a gaping
     black hole appears.  A horrible WIND, SPARKS and
     circles of expanding light issues from it.

                      JESSICA (V.O)
                    (inner voice)(fearful)
               No!  This is the place where we cannot
               look.  The place only for the eyes of the
               Kwisatz Haderach.

197B.     THE FETUS - NIGHT

     The fetus twists down the tunnel to join Jessica,
     her umbilical cord trailing behind.  She SCREAMS as
     she looks into the hole.

197C.     THE NAVIGATOR - NIGHT

     She and Jessica see a shape moving deep within the
     windy hole.  It is a Third Stage Navigator, ROARING.

                         JESSICA
               What is this?...  Is this what kills the
               men who enter here?

     She quickly takes the fetus back up the tunnel.  As
     they move:

                 JESSICA (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               Now my daughter and I are both Reverend

                    (distant)
               I've been a long time waiting for you.
               Here is my life.

198. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The old Reverend Mother Ramallo slumps forward onto
     the stone, dead.  The crowd waits.  The corpse is
     tenderly removed.  Jessica very slowly opens her
     eyes and looks about her.  The monk holds the jug to
     her lips.

                          MONK
               Change it that we may all drink of it.
--
     Jessica spews water into the spout.  The monk swirls
     the jug, sniffs at the spout and then drinks.

                      MONK (CONT'D)
               It is changed!

199. INT. HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The Fremen suddenly turn their attention to Paul....
     They whisper "It is the prophecy!"  They soon begin
     to CHANT... "Muad'dib....  Muad'dib" over and over
     again.  The chanting sounds fill the hall along with
     the ghostly wind organ.

169. INT. STAIRCASE - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The Baron and Feyd descend several steps into a
     darker area of Geidi Prime.  Feyd is carrying a
     strange creature in a small wire cage.  The Baron is
     floating as he descends.

                          BARON
                    (takes a drink)
               Feyd, even though he's aging, Thufir is
               one of the finest Mentats in the
               Universe... and he's mine, Feyd... all
               mine....  Quiet now.

                          FEYD
               I will.

170. INT. BASEMENT ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     Nefud stands eating candies behind Thufir's chair.
     Nefud has a stun gun, even though Thufir's hands are
     tied.  The Baron enters with Feyd.

                          BARON
               Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your
               heart plug already....  Don't be angry.
               Everyone gets one here.  But this is not
               why we're here.  We've brought you a
               little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it
               if you wish to live.  A poison has been
               introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By
               milking this smooth little cat body each
               day you receive your antidote... it must
               be done each day....  Also, you must do
               something for me if you wish to live.  You
               know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat...

     Thufir gives the Baron a weak, wide-eyed stare.

                          FEYD
               All I can see is an Atreides that I want
               to kill.

                          BARON
               Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now,
               aren't you Thufir?

                         THUFIR
                    (inner voice)
               My dear Duke... how I have failed you.

211. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Jessica's face shows signs of straining.  Women move
     around her, Chani and Harah at her side, helping her
     give birth.  Suddenly ALIA is born and her freshly-
     born moist body is held up in front of Jessica.
     Alia's eyes snap open, burning brightly.

                          HARAH
               What will you call her?

                         JESSICA
               Alia.

     As they lift Alia for Jessica to see...

                          ALIA
               Mother.

210. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Paul walks down the steps into the training room -
     followed by Harah's two sons.  He pauses at the foot
     of the steps.

                          PAUL
               Activate your weirding modules...

     Paul activates his, and the Fremens follow suit.

                          PAUL
               Set the range for two meters.

     Paul walks down the line of Fremen.

                          PAUL
               Korba...
                    (points to robot)

               Motion... Chuuk-sa...

                          KORBA
               Chuuuk-sa...

     He fires the module and the arm of the robot is shot
     off.  Paul smiles and hits him on the shoulder -
     Paul walks on.

                          PAUL
               Stilgar...

     One of the FREMEN calls out to Paul.

                        A FREMEN
               Muad'dib!...

     The word `Muad'dib' causes a tremendous power to
     build.  The module shakes violently in his hand - it
     suddenly fires upwards, and the wall explodes.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               My own name is a killing word.  Will it be
               a healing word as well?

               fighters to serve you as your guard... the

213. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     An EXPLOSION.  Paul turns and his eyes are totally
     blue.  He lifts binoculars to them and looks.  He
     sees the Fremen fighters below charging at the
     Harkonnens.  As the Fremen run they make powerful
     SOUNDS with their weirding modules, exploding
     everything in their path and catching things on
     fire.

213A.     EXT. CARRYALL - DESERT - DAY

     In the distance, a huge spice carryall is shot down
     and it falls to the ground EXPLODING more violently

               Sound... as a weapon.  If only you could
               see them, father.

     Paul smiles as he looks at the battle in the
     distance.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (his V.O. from the past)
               When the spice flow stops, the entire
               Universe will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron
               and the Emperor himself will be forced to
               deal with us.

214. INT. PASSAGEWAYS - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Rabban stares dumbfounded as many Harkonnen wounded
     and dead are brought through the passageway beyond.
     Rabban grabs a Harkonnen and asks:

                         RABBAN
               What happened?  What happened to you?
               What is he saying?

                    WOUNDED HARKONNEN
               Muad'dib!...  Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!...
               Muad'dib!

     Rabban pushes him away.

                   A HARKONNEN SOLDIER
               He's been repeating that name ever since
               we found him.

                         RABBAN
               Who is this Muad'dib?

215. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES; dunes.  A big thumper is forced into the
     sands.  A RHYTHM is heard pounding on Fremen hand
     drums and rhythm instruments.  Feet scramble.  Black
     stillsuited Fedaykin warrior bodyguards gather.
     Stilgar turns.

               sandrider... and travel as a Fremen.  Take
               the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and
               ride as a leader of men.

217. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     As Paul leaves the troop to plant the second
     thumper:

                     STILGAR (V.O.)
               Two thumpers are planted.  The worm may
               not surface for the first - he will rise
               for the second.  Remember, when the worm
               approaches, you must be utterly still...
               and close enough to plant the hook firmly
               under a ring segment....  The worm will
               turn to lift this exposed area as far from
               the abrasive sand as possible and it will
               take you with it -- to the top.  Do not
               get too close as he approaches... the sand
               will engulf you....  Wait till the head of
               the worm passes -- then go... quickly.

                    STILGAR & FREMEN
               Shai-Hulud... Shai-Hulud.

     In the distance the telltale SOUND of the worm's
     approach begins.  This worm is deep underground and
     the sound is low and the ground trembles violently.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Only the very strong ones travel this
               deep....

     The SOUND and VIBRATIONS continue to build.  In the
     distance, the Fedaykin and Stilgar watch.

                         STILGAR
                    (to the others)
               Usul has called a big one.  Again... it is
               the legend.

219. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES... dunes RHYTHM.  THUNDEROUS approach of
     the worm.  Paul still cannot see the worm, but the
     sound begins to drown out the Fremen rhythm
     instruments and the sand begins to VIBRATE.
     Suddenly, Paul SEES...

219A.     EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - DAY

     ...a mountain of sands rise up, towering, thundering
     -- lightning SPARKS fissuring throughout the air
     above the worm.

     The mountain approaches at a terrifying speed.
     Then, the worm appears -- rushing.  The mouth, at
     first a small opening, begins to widen -- exposing a
     thousand glistening teeth.

219B.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Paul freezes.  He lets the worm get closer and
     closer.  The HEAT WAVES distort the gigantic form,
     making it more hideous -- more foreign.  He moves
     forward.  The others watch anxiously.  This worm is
     big.  It is so much larger than imaged.  Its top
     towers 125 feet in the air.  The segments are each
     ten feet wide.

219C.     EXT. VERTICAL SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Paul gets close and running alongside, he plants the
     hook under a segment and pulls back.  The SOUND is
     excruciatingly loud.  The sand is so deep and more
     is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm.
     Paul gets caught in it and falls. He narrowly
     escapes being sucked under the beast.  He gets up --
     runs again and plants the hook once more.  He runs
     faster, bending the segment open to expose the
     tender flesh.

219D.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Suddenly the worm begins to turn.  Paul pulls
     himself up the body as it turns -- holding onto the
     hook.  Soon he is fifty -- sixty -- seventy feet off
     the ground -- going higher.  The giant worm gets the
     second thumper and Paul at that moment climbs to the
     top.  He plants the second hook.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A sandrider!...

     Paul works the hooks into the breathing holes along
     the body...
--
219E.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     ...causing the great beast to make a slow turn
     toward Stilgar and the bodyguard.  They set
     themselves and as the worm passes...

219F.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     ...they all clamber on, climbing up the sides to the
     top.

                          PAUL
                    (yelling)
               Long live the fighters!

     They return the traditional CALL and Paul steers the
     maker in a giant circle.  They head out across the
     dunes.

               have reported a significant delay in
               delivery of spice per CHOAM agreement.
               This constitutes a serious violation of
               CHOAM codes.  Contact Baron Vladimir
               Harkonnen immediately.

219H.     INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     A furious Rabban sirs in a black steel tub in the
     Great Hall.  A squad of TROOPS stands at attention
     in front of him, listening to his screaming fit.

                         RABBAN
               Falsify the reports.  We can't hide it
               all, tell them we've lost only two hundred
               harvesters... and forty carryalls... and
               don't let my uncle know about the
               destruction of the spice silos....  I will
               catch this Muad'dib and suck the blood
               from him!!  SUCK THE BLOOD FROM HIM!!!

     SMOKE billows from a burning harvester.

226B.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Fighting is going on between Fremen and some
     smugglers.  Paul moves down a smokey dune with
     Stilgar followed by Fremen and Fedaykin.

                          PAUL
               We surprised a band of smugglers.

                         STILGAR
                    (racing into thick smoke)
               Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.

     Paul and Stilgar move through the smoke.  A man runs
     up with a maula pistol aimed at Paul but Paul spins
     and punctures the man's chest with a sound from his
     weirding module.  Paul turns and a large figure
     comes through the smoke.  They surprise each other.
     The figure holds a gun.

                          PAUL
               Gurney!...

     The figure stops -- stunned.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               You've no need of your weapons with me
               Gurney Halleck.

                         GURNEY
                    (peering; whisper of hope)
               Paul!!  Paul!!

                          PAUL
               Don't you trust your own eyes.

                         GURNEY
               They said you were dead.  They said...

     Paul shows him the signet ring on his fingers.
     Gurney moves forward, his eyes tearing, and the two
     embrace each other and pound each other on the back.

                         GURNEY
               You young pup!  You young pup!

               received a coded threat from the Guild.
               Spice production is in serious jeopardy...
               Giedi Prime supplying false reports...
               Guild to visit Emperor in one standard
               day.

228. INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The Emperor sits on his throne.  Behind him are his
     Sardaukar officers.  In front of him are several
     Guildsmen.  One holds a large electrical apparatus
     up to the face plate of another which translates his
     strange voice into English.

                   TANKED GUILDSMAN #2
               Emperor Shaddam IV... You have one last
               chance to take matters into your own hands
               and bring the situation under the control
               on Arrakis.

                         EMPEROR
               What do you mean one last...

                   TANKED GUILDSMAN #2
               Do not speak!...  Listen!...  You do not
               have more than this one chance....  I
               represent the entire Guild in this
               matter....  You have failed to kill the
               Atreides heir... Paul.

                         EMPEROR
               But he was said to...

                   TANKED GUILDSMEN #2
                    (moans like a cow)
               Noooooo... he is not dead.  He is not
               eaten by worms as you have wanted to
               believe.  He is not missing.  He is in the
               deep desert with the Fremen.  The Spice is
               in great danger.  We are not asking... we
               are telling... remedy the situation or you
               will live out your life in a pain
               amplifier.

     The Guildsmen turn and leave.

                         EMPEROR
               Who is this Paula Atreides to the Guild?
               And why?

223. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - DAY

     At the end of the passageway, standing alone --
     staring with powerful intense blue-within-blue eyes
     -- is ALIA.  She's listening mentally.

                      HARAH (V.O.)
               ...they don't like Alia around.  She
               frightens them.  It is the strangeness of
               your daughter.

224. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - DAY

                         JESSICA

     Alia is listening - then exits.

225. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - DAY

     Alia listens mentally.

                     JESSICA (V.O.)
               ...beyond her years and of things no child
               could know -- things of the past.
                    (pause)

     Alia begins walking.  She appears to be angry.

                 JESSICA (V.O.)(CONT'D)
               A daughter who knew at birth everything I
               know...

226. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - DAY

                          HARAH
               But Your Reverence, they won't have her
               around them.

     Alia enters.

                          ALIA
                    (screaming little adult voice)
               Harah!  Would they deny me the right to
               use this mind?...

                    (using The Voice)
               Would they deny me the right to use this
               voice?...

     Harah's head nearly bursts with pain and she SCREAMS
     as if she were dying.

               I want fifty legions of Sardaukar on
               Arrakis at once.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #1
               Fifty legions?...
                    (he looks at the other officers with
                    worry)
               That's our entire reserves as well.

                         EMPEROR
               This is genocide...  the deliberate and
               systematic destruction of all life on

231. INT. PAUL'S ROOM - SIETCH

     There is a growing, powerful sound of a worm
     approaching as Paul and Chani are lying together in
     the darkness of their sleeping chamber.  Paul's eyes
     snap open and he sees Chani looking down at him (the
     last image of the future in the desert).

                          CHANI
               You were calling my name... it frightened
               me.

     In the hollow of a huge dune, Paul stops with Chani.
     They share a look into each other's eyes.  Paul
     turns towards the Fedaykin and nods.  They move in
     quickly to tie and wrap Paul in Fremen rope.  They
     move back and wait quietly.  Chani moves in very
     close to Paul.  She holds a glass vial of the blue
     water of life.

                          PAUL
               Hurry!  All I see is darkness.

                          CHANI
               Paul... I will love you forever... in life
               or in death... let Shai-Hulud judge now.
                    (whispering)
               You are my life.

     She pours the blue liquid into Paul's mouth.  Slow
     move into Paul's face as:

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Now... the test of the water of life...
               what is it that waits for me in this
               darkness?

233A.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Fade to black then dissolves to dark blue fluid.  A
     blue drop falls into the blue fluid - a huge low
     thud - then quiet.

233B.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Cut to Paul screaming horribly in the desert.

235. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Alia walks forward in the very dark room.  Blood
     rushes from her nose.  She forces herself to walk to
     Jessica's bed.  She finds that Jessica's nose is
     bleeding also.  Jessica wakes in pain.  They stare
     at each other in the darkness.

                         JESSICA
               ALIA!

                          ALIA
               Mother - help me!

                         JESSICA
                    (struggling)
               Alia!  What is it?
--
                          ALIA
               It's Paul.  He's taken the Water of Life.

233C.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Cut to quiet black - dissolve again to blue -
     another drop - low thud - quietness - fade to black.

245A.     EXT. EMPEROR'S SPACESHIP - SPACE

     The Emperor's space ship soars towards us.

246. INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - SPACE

     The Reverend Mother Helen Mohiam is on the floor,
     bleeding from the nose and weak from pain.  The
     Emperor looks on in horror.

233D.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Suddenly screaming towards us is white rings, stars
     and a huge Guild Navigator.

233E.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Cut to Paul's eyes - tightly closed, oozing fresh
     blood.

233F.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     SCREAMING SOUND.  Paul's mouth opens and a giant
     wind is stirred on the desert.

234. (Deleted)

235A.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Navigator chewing giant eye and spewing blood and
     light and sounds.  Paul's mouth double exposes over
     Navigator and eye.  The sound from Paul's mouth
     destroys the Navigator and opens the Alam.
     Navigator bursts into a huge light ring and we
     quickly travel through ring after ring and masses of
     liquid stars.  The light increases until it is
     blinding and then in the light...

235B.     EXT. FLOWER BLOSSOMING

     A golden flower blossoms and glows brilliantly -
     suddenly the powerful sound of an approaching worm.

236. through 239.   (Deleted)

240. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Chani and the Fedaykin freeze and watch in horror as
     seven giant worms converge on them.  The worms break
     the desert surface and rise, towering over them.
     The worms hover and wait.

240A.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Chani looks to the Fedaykin, then they look at Paul
     who lies motionless.  She cuts the rope bonds with
     her crysknife.  Her fingers tremble as does the
     whole of the desert.

     Paul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani
     stares at him in awe.

                          CHANI
               Paul... Paul.
240B.     EXT. WAVE CRASHING

     A huge wave crashes and Paul sees the image of his
     father.  Paul slowly gets to his knees, then stands.

240C.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
               Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS
               AWAKENED.

     Giant echoes of this phrase reverberate across the
     vast desert.  The worms bend back into the sand and
     leave with thundering power.

     MUSIC FULL.

251. EXT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The Rock Ledge of Sietch Tabr is filled with
     Fedaykin and monks; Chani, Jessica, Gurney and
     Stilgar stand together near the back.  Paul moves
     out on the Rock Ledge overlooking the Hall of Rites
     which is crowded with Fremen warriors who chant
     "Maud'Dib" along with the powerful sounds of the
     WIND ORGAN and FREMEN war DRUMS.

     Paul raises his open hand.  SILENCE.  Only the organ
     continues with a soft low NOTE.  The Fremen wait.

                          PAUL
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     A quiet, haunting MOAN of recognition of a master
     rises from the Fremen.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (loud)
               Your time has come.
                    (inner voice)
               Father... our time has come.
                    (out loud again)
               A storm is coming -- our storm... and when
               it comes it will shake the Universe.
               Emperor... we come for you.

     A thunderous ROAR arises.  War DRUMS pound.  The
     ORGAN blows hurricaine of power through the sietch.

                          PAUL
                    (he raises crysknife)
               Long live the fighters!

                         STILGAR
               Long live the fighters!

     Fremen carrying weapons begin moving out in long
     lines from the Hall as the war DRUMS pound.

               Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the
               atomics.  I want an opening through the
               entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have
               wormsign?

     Stilgar and Gurney laugh.

                         STILGAR
               Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of
               which even God has never seen.

     Paul smiles.

261. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Looking down over the huge desert it looks like a
     living sea of wormsign.  Everywhere ripples appear
     and worms are surfacing.

     Thousands of Fremen are running, positioning

262. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Dust clouds grow faster and the speed of the WIND

               Bring in that floating fat man... the
               Baron.

     The Baron is brought in.  Distant warning SIGNALS
     begin.  The Baron is fighting to contain his fear
     because RABBAN'S HEAD SITS ALL BLOODY ON THE FLOOR
     in front of him.  Finally the Emperor speaks.

                         EMPEROR
               Why have you brought me here?

                          BARON
               Your Highness... There must be some
               mistake... I never requested your
               presence.

                         EMPEROR
               Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it.
               Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad
               judgement in assigning to Rabban --
                    (he gestures toward the head)
               -- the governorship....  You forced me to
               come here and set things straight...
               personally.

                         A VOICE
               Bring in the messenger.

     Alia is brought in by the Sardaukar soldiers.  She
     is smiling.

                          ALIA
               I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor
               Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be
               very pleased with you.

                         EMPEROR
               Silence!...  I do not court your brother's
               pleasure.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother looks horrified and
     grabs her throat.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (struggling, speaking)
               Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!!
               Kill her.
                    (points to Alia, who is smiling at
                    her)
               Get out of my mind!!!

                          ALIA
               Not until you tell them both who I really
               am.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (strained speech void of emotion)
               Sister of Paul Muad'dib.

     The Reverend Mother slumps.  The Baron's mouth flies
     open.  The Emperor's face goes pale, his lips
     tremble.

                         EMPEROR
               Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?!

     He turns quickly and looks at the two Guild agents
     present in the room.  They stare at him icily.  Alia
     is smiles happily.

268. INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Paul smiles.

                          PAUL
                    (laughs)(to Gurney and Stilgar)
               Alia keeps pace with the storm.
--
     Gurney and Stilgar don't understand.  Suddenly
     enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the
     Shield Wall.

                          PAUL
               Gurney, now!

     Gurney gives a hand signal and...

                         GURNEY
                    (they put on their hoods)
               Atomics!

269. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     ...TWENTY EXPLOSIONS of hydrogen bomb intensity go
     off in a row, cutting a huge gorge through the width
     of the massive Shield Wall.  As the EXPLOSIONS go
     off, a WIND howls, destroying much of Arrakeen and
     covering the rest with tons of sand.  Sand rips at
     the Palace and the Emperor's ship.

270. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY

     Alia smiles as they HEAR the tremendous roaring,
     atomic screams of the explosions.  The Emperor's
     ship's warning SIGNALS are now close and loud.

                          ALIA
               My brother is coming... with many Fremen
               warriors.

     A Sardaukar rushes in.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               The Shield Wall is gone.

                         EMPEROR
               Impossible!

                          ALIA
               Not impossible.  I told you... He is here
               now.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               Majesty, into the ship!

                         EMPEROR
                    (to his officers)(rising)
               Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this
               little abomination to the storm.

     They all leave the room, including the Sardaukars.

272. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY

                          BARON
               I have her, Majesty!

     The Baron floats down to her.  Alia turns to him --
     still smiling.  With a flash of her hand she reaches
     out and swipes at the Baron's face.  He CRIES OUT in
     pain.  She pulls his suspensor plugs and pushes him
     back, then slowly shows him the tiny needle she
     holds in her hand.  He spins crazily as he screams
     from the poison.

273. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Worms, each with hundreds of Fremen on them, come
     slithering through the newly-formed canyon in the
     Shield Wall.

273A.     EXT. WORMS - SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Paul rides the lead worm with Gurney and Stilgar by
     his side.  The storm is howling and blowing with
     horrifying intensity.

273B.     INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

     The Emperor and his Sardaukar officers in a darkened
     room where they are horrified to see on the screens
     the hundreds of worms which are coming into the
     Arrakeen valley.  All their faces show fear.

272. BACK TO SCENE
     INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - GREEN THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Suddenly the wall behind Alia and the spinning Baron
     is completely blown away by a BLAST.

     The Baron floats and spins out into the storm.

274. EXT. ARRAKEEN - DAY

     As the worms enter the Arrakeen basin they meet the
     Sardaukar.  The Sardaukar don't have a chance -- the
     worms suck them up by the hundreds.  The Fremen on
     the worm's backs fire weapons, killing the few
     Sardaukar the worms leave behind.

275. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     The space ships which were recently airborne are now
     crashing because of the storm.
--
272A.     NEW SCENE

     The Baron floats and spins high in the dust clouds
     of the storm over the Arrakeen Valley.

274A.     NEW SCENE

     The worm, that Paul, Gurney and Stilgar are riding,
     suddenly rears up.  Its mouth opens.  The Baron
     appears as a tiny spinning shape.  He flies directly
     into the mouth of this collosal worm and is
     devoured.

277. EXT. STEEL TENT - LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     A thousand Fremen battle Sardaukar outside the
     Emperor's tent.  They soon overpower them and rush
     into the giant steel structure.

278. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     The entire airfield is now filled with wild worms,
     Fremen, and dead or dying Sardaukar.

276. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Alia moves dreamily among the dying Sardaukar.

279. through 280.   (Deleted)

281. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul enters the Palace hall and the first thing he
     sees is the giant bull's head.  The horns have been
     blown off and the Atreides banner has been stuffed
     and wired into the mouth.

     A WIND moans through the Palace.

     Paul turns.  Gurney and several guards bring in the
     Emperor, Irulan, the Reverend Mother, Sardaukar
     generals, Guildsmen, Feyd and Thufir.  The Fedaykin
     and Fremen troops line the walls.

     Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil
     smile.

     Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back
     defiantly.  Paul moves his gaze to Irulan, who
     lowers her eyes.  He then sees his old teacher,
     Thufir Hawat, whose tired eyes wander helplessly.
--
                          PAUL
               Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the
               captives.  Let him stand free.

                         GURNEY
               My Lord?

                          PAUL
               Let him stand free!

     The Emperor turns nervously to Feyd, who passes a
     golden dagger to Thufir.

                          FEYD
                    (to Thufir)
               The antidote...

                         GURNEY
                    (gestures to Thufir)
               Thufir.  Come.

     Thufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They
     come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely
     tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks
     Thufir over.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               A knife....
                    (out loud)
               In payment of the many years of service to
               my family, you may know ask of me anything
               you wish.  Anything at all.
                    (quietly)
               Do you need my life, old friend?

     He turns his back on him.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (quiet)
               It is yours.

     Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide.

                          PAUL
               I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to
               strike, do it now.

     Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old
     Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing
     motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags.

     His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul
     urgently.
--
                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Three... generations... of you...

     His breath escapes him and he is dead.

                          PAUL
                    (to the guards)
               Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.
               Do him all honor.

     The guards do as they are instructed.

                          PAUL
               Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild
               Heighliners above us containing many Great
               Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM
               BACK!

                         EMPEROR
               How dare you speak to me...

                      GUILDSMAN #2
                    (speaking into electric microphone)
               Stop your speaking!!

                          PAUL
                    (to the Guildsmen)
               Good.  You have some idea of what I would
               do but I will tell it to one who has never
               been seen... one who hides deep in the
               Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it
               first.

                      GUILDSMEN #3
                    (fear)
               No!

     Paul smiles as we move closer and closer to him.

282. INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     Suddenly we are in the Heighliner control room, near
     the floor in the chemical spills.  We move up into
     the orange gas.  THUNDERING begins to shake the
     Heighliner.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Where are you....  Let me see you or there
               will be no spice.
--
     We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING.
     Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.

                   PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D)
               You know what I'm about to say is true....
               I have the power to destroy the spice
               forever.

     The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a
     horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and
     grows louder and louder.

283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING
     and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen
     stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and
     frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend
     Mother then turns and glares at Paul.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking
               into that place where you dare not look.
               You'll find me there staring back at you!!
               You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety
               generations to produce the one person your
               schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I
               will never be yours.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Stop him, Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               Stop him yourself.

                          PAUL
               You saw a part of what the race needs in
               the beginning.  In time you perverted the
               truth.  You sought to control human
               breeding and intermix a select few
               according to a selfish master plan.  How
               little you understand.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You mustn't speak of...

                          PAUL
                    (using The Voice)
               SILENCE!

     The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his
     shout.  Her breath is knocked out of her.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I remember your gom jabbar, now you
               remember mine.  I can kill with a word.
--
     A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the
     prophecy.

                       FEDAYKIN #1
               ...and his word shall carry death eternal
               to those who stand against the righteous.

     Feyd hears this and is angered.

                          FEYD
               The righteous!

                          PAUL
                    (to Emperor)
               There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the
               Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.

                         EMPEROR
               If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my
               blade in his hand.

                          FEYD
               I wish it.
                    (steps forward)

                         GURNEY
               This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me,
               please, my Lord.

                          PAUL
               The Emperor's blade.

     Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile.
     Paul takes out his crysknife.  They begin to circle
     each other.

     Paul smiles, circling still.  Suddenly, Feyd leaps,
     his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily
     evades it, moving away.  They begin to circle again.

     He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously
     close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on
     his face.

                          FEYD
               Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill
               you!  I will kill him!

     Feyd smiles.  He lashes out biting Paul's hand.
     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.

     Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also
     forward.  Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again
     reels away.  Again, Feyd thrusts.
--
     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd
     moves away effortlessly.  Feyd counters and kicks
     Paul to the ground.

                          CHANI
               Paul!

     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.

                          FEYD
                    (smiling)
               Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps?
               Will she deserve my special attentions?

     Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs
     his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a
     straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer
     and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it
     away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's
     girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges
     powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses
     taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not
     before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the
     floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.

                          FEYD
                    (whispering)
               You see... your death... my blade will
               finish you.

     Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes
     Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash.

     Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward
     through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife
     continues up through his tongue and through to his
     brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he
     jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his
     feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in
     him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible,
     powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture
     and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The
     Fedaykin smile.

                       FEDAYKIN #2
               Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

     Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the
     Emperor.

                          PAUL
               Now, I will tell you how it will be.
               Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way
               for an Atreides to take the throne.

                         EMPEROR
               I sit on the throne!!
--
                          PAUL
               You will sit on a throne on Selusa
               Secundus, your prison planet.  Either that
               or you will die.

     The Emperor is still.  Paul moves to Chani.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (to Chani)
               The Princess shall have no more of me than
               my name... no child of mine or touch the
               softness of glance... nor instant of
               desire....  This is my promise to you...
                    (whispering)
               ...my love.

     Paul turns back to the others.

     Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.

                         JESSICA
               Think on it Chani... We who carry the name
               of concubine... history will call us
               wives.

     Alia enters with two monks.  She signals and one of
     them places a cloak over Paul's shoulders.

                          PAUL
               The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib.
               They will have their Holy War to cleanse
               the Universe... they will have Arrakis...
               Dune... their planet.  There will be
               flowing water here open to the sky and
               rich green oases.  For the spice there
               will always be some desert.  There will be
               fierce winds and trials to toughen men.
               We Fremen have a saying...
                    (he stares at the Reverend Mother)
               "God created Arrakis to train the
               faithful."
               One cannot go against the word of God.

     Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.

                          ALIA
               And how can this be?

     There are three powerful drum hits.

                      ALIA (CONT'D)
               For... he is the Kwisatz Haderach!

     Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing
     wind.  Lightning and thunder begin.  Clouds begin to
     form over the Palace.  In the half-light of dusk,
     thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden
     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into
     the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five
     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a
     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand
     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling
     from the sky.

285. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     WE MOVE through Paul's glowing blue eyes into
     beautiful blue luminescent light.

     A gigantic WIND arises, and suddenly appearing in
     the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like
     gold glass off into infinite.  The blue becomes
     darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the
     night.

                         THE END

        July 2000 Draft




    FOR EDUCATIONAL
     PURPOSES ONLY

                      ARAC ATTACK!


FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

A rabbit hops across rough terrain.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of
toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP
454.


INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.

                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.

                         PIG PEN
           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first
truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses
the highway in front of the third.


INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
           I will not fear the unexpected.

                         PIG PEN
           I will not fear the unexpected.

The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.

                           PIG PEN
           Ahhhhhhhhhh!

Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
bunny.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker.

                                                        2.

INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT

Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain
control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the
rig together.


EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT

The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the
water below.


EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT

A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a
gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon
ink.


EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
horsefly.

JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
people.

                         JOSHUA
          Hey, Mike.   Check this one out.

MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard
and fast for this bright, little nerd.

                         MIKE
          He's huge!

                        JOSHUA
          They've been like this all week.
          Must be something extra tasty in
          the water.

                         MIKE
          Like what?

                        JOSHUA
          Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back
          in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a
          dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
          satisfying.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                         3.

CONTINUED:

                              MIKE
             You ate snake?

                           JOSHUA
             When you're thirty klicks out from
             the nearest firebase. Humpin'
             through the wake-up with your
             finger on the trigger. Charlie
             doesn't give you time to stop for
             cutlet.

As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-
colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.


EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere.


INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.

                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
             Charlie, don't surf!

                              JOSHUA
             Quiet, bird.     We're working.

Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a
specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.

                           JOSHUA
                    (dims tank lights)
             The sun is going down, my
             nocturnal hunters. It's time to
             come out and feed.

Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.

                          MIKE
             Yeah. They're definitely getting
             bigger.

                           JOSHUA
             I've calculated a growth factor of
             twelve percent over the last
             forty-eight hours. But that seems
             to be accelerating.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           4.

CONTINUED:

                           MIKE
             All from eating these bugs?   Maybe
             I should try some.

Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects.

                           MIKE
             Run, little guys.

                           JOSHUA
             They can't outrun the food chain.

                           MIKE
             I could get away.

                           JOSHUA
             Imagine yourself the size of that
             fly. A scytodes spitter would be
             as big as a Cadillac. You'd be
             spider chow, kid.

Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel.

                           MIKE
             Are the new tarantulas in here?

                           JOSHUA
             Took me forever to get a breeding
             set of Chilean reds. I must have
             bribed every customs agent from
             Vegas to Santiago.

Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
entrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, male
tarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,
then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a
mummy-like bundle.

                           MIKE
             That is too cool.

                           JOSHUA
             Male tarantulas compete for the
             female's attention.
                           (MORE)

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           5.

CONTINUED:

                           JOSHUA (CONT'D)
             Each one tries to bring her the
             best present. Bugs, rats, even
             the occasional parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS.

                           JOSHUA
             The prey is cocooned alive so she
             can eat them in her nest. You
             know how women love breakfast in
             bed.

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.

                           JOSHUA
             Take a look, the female of the
             species is three times as big as
             the male.

Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red
tarantula.

                           JOSHUA
             Say hello to Consuela.

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.

                           JOSHUA
             She fills her prey with digestive
             acid to liquify the internal
             organs. Now watch... She'll drink
             her victim from the inside out.
             While it's still alive!

                           MIKE
                    (looks queasy)
             And you wonder why my mom doesn't
             like me hanging out with you.

                           JOSHUA
             Arachnids have been roaming the
             earth for millions of years. And
             they'll be here long after the
             human race is dead and buried.

Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils.

                            MIKE
             Bad!   Bad Consuela!

Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.

                                                        6.

TARANTULA POV - MIKE

The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.


BACK TO MIKE

Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.

                        MIKE
          Do that again and I feed you to
          the parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN.

                        JOSHUA
          There's your mom.

                        MIKE
          See you tomorrow, Joshua!

Mike heads for the door.


EXT. DESERT - DAY

The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the
door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,
PROSPERITY, NV.


INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of
the tunnel.

CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile
fades...

                           CHRIS
          Damn.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          7.

CONTINUED:

Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's
sack lunch.

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch.

                           CHRIS
             Hope you like bologna!



EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the
trunk.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

SAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity
and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside
her.

                             MIKE
             You   should see them, Mom. Each
             one   has a unique feeding behavior.
             The   spitters fire poisonous snot.
             The   tarantulas mummify their prey.
             The   jumpers can...

                           SAM
             Why does he have all those things?

                           MIKE
             He studies them. NASA uses spider
             webs in outer space. And for
             medicine. They've been here
             forever, and they'll be here long
             after we're all dead.

                           SAM
             You're givin' me nightmares.

                           MIKE
             Nightmares are cool.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         8.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             U.P.S. brought this to the
             station.

Sam hands Mike a small package.

                           MIKE
             It's from Dad! He didn't forget
             my birthday. I told you he
             wouldn't.

                           SAM
             Better late than never.

Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia PDA.

                             MIKE
             Rockin'!

                           SAM
             Is that the one you wanted?

                           MIKE
             Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of
             ram. Integrated modem. Voice
             recording capability. This baby
             is tight.

Mike can't turn on the gizmo.

                             SAM
             What's wrong?

                           MIKE
             He forgot to send the batteries.

                           SAM
                    (annoyed)
             I told him to send batteries.


EXT. DESERT - DAY

The ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the
desert.

BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good
looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY
PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe
Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other
bike.

                           BRET
             Hang on, babydoll!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                             9.

CONTINUED:

They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow
lines. Wheelie for days. Ashley peeks over Bret's
shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite
lane.

                           ASHLEY
             Oh shit.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.

                           SAM
             Hang on.

                           MIKE
             Why?


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY

The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights
ablaze. SIREN WAILING. The bikes pull over to the
shoulder.


EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY

The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind.        Sam's
voice barks over the PA.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             Party's over, gentlemen.   Off the
             bikes.

Sam exits the car and approaches.       The bikers dismount.

                           BRET
             There is something very sexy about
             an older woman in uniform.

                           LARRY
             Her nine-millimeter gives me a
             stiffy.

                           ASHLEY
             Don't antagonize her, you guys.

                           SAM
             I told you not to act like
             kamikazes. Especially with Ashley
             riding behind. That is
             unacceptable, Bret.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            10.

CONTINUED:

                           BRET
             I could always ride her from
             behind.

Larry snickers.     Sam steels her rage.

                           SAM
             You just bought yourself a
             reckless.

Sam begins to write up the ticket.

                           ASHLEY
             Can't you give 'em a break?

                           SAM
             Get in the car, Ashley.       Now.

                              ASHLEY
             But, Mom!

Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance.

                           BRET
             No sweat, babydoll.       We'll hook up
             later.

                           SAM
                    (threatening)
             Over my dead body.


INT. SAM'S COP CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Mike grins from the front seat as Ashley climbs in back.

                           MIKE
             You have the right to remain
             silent. Anything you say can and
             will be used...

                              ASHLEY
             Shut up, dork.


EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY - DAY

Sam hands Bret the ticket.

                           BRET
             Larry, do we know anybody at City
             Hall who can mark this go away?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.

CONTINUED:

                           LARRY
             Your Dad is the Mayor.

                           BRET
             Oh, yeah.
                    (to Sam)
             He signs your paycheck.

                           SAM
             The next time you put my
             daughter's life in danger, I'll
             show you exactly how little that
             means to me.

Bret and Larry feel her resolve.

                           BRET
             Relax, bee-otch. It's all good.

The punks remount their bikes.

                           SAM
             I want both wheels on the ground.

The punks REV their BIKES and defiantly wheelie toward
town.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

Sam climbs behind the wheel.

                           MIKE
             I read her her rights.

                           SAM
             I can always count on you, Mike.

Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town.

                           ASHLEY
             Do you get off on humiliating me?

                           SAM
             This bad girl act doesn't suit
             you, Ash.

                           ASHLEY
             I'm just trying to have fun.
             Don't you remember what it's like
             to grow up here?

                           SAM
             That's what scares me.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          12.

CONTINUED:

Sam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out
a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley.

                           SAM
             I told you to keep this with you.

Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack.

                           ASHLEY
             You are so over protective.

Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response.

                           SAM
             A mother's job is to protect her
             children.

                           ASHLEY
             You need to start trusting me.

                           SAM
             I'd like to. But you keep
             skipping classes to go to the
             dunes with Bret.

                           ASHLEY
             Why do you hate him so much?

                           SAM
             I don't hate him. I just want you
             to have a future. I thought you
             wanted to get out of town. Go to
             med school.

                           ASHLEY
             Maybe I want to stay. I could get
             pregnant by nineteen. Then
             divorce with a couple of kids I
             can't handle. Slap on a badge and
             be a trailer trash sheriff.

                           SAM
                    (deeply hurt)
             Thanks for the flashback.

They drive on in painful silence.     Mike turns ON the
RADIO.

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             ... listening to W.F.R.E. Freedom
             radio. We've put aside the
             U.F.O.'s and conspiracy
             theories...

                                                       13.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Chris drives into town with the RADIO ON.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          ... for some down home talk back
          with our own mayor: Wade Hale.

                        CHRIS
          Oh, great.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Thanks, Harlan. As I was saying,
          Chemical Technologies has been
          looking for viable storage sites.
          And Prosperity is lucky enough to
          be on that list.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Lucky? I think most of us are
          insulted that some outsiders think
          our town is a perfect place to
          dump toxic waste.

                        CHRIS
          Right on.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Chris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much
bigger than a few football fields. The kind of place
where everybody has known each other since childhood.
Some buildings date back to the 1880's gold rush.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Isn't this just your latest get-
          rich quick scheme?

At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless
rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the many
outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden
Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:
"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINAL
CLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio
antenna.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Your mall has more employees than
          customers.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK (TOWN, MAIN STREET) - DAY

Chris smiles as he listens to the RADIO.

                                              (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

                           WADE (V.O.)
             I may have overestimated the need
             for 100,000 square feet of outlet
             shopping.


EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE - DAY

BEVERLY (40's) is tending to her garden as she listens to
a transistor radio.

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             And your ostrich ranch?

                           WADE (V.O.)
             If the government subsidies hadn't
             dried up, I'd still be rolling in
             cash.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An airstream at the far end of town. Signs identify it
as: "FREEDOM RADIO." A brand new humvee is parked out
front.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Walls decorated with clippings about aliens, monsters,
and conspiracies. Two men sit at a home built
transmitter.

HARLAN GRIFFITH (40s) wears an "Aliens Go Home!" T-
shirt. He eats from a box of Frosted Flakes and drinks
Jolt cola.

WADE HALE (40s) is the mayor of Prosperity. A slick-
haired dandy who looks more like a Vegas lounge singer
than a Mayor.

                            WADE
             With one phone call I could put
             together a deal that would make us
             all very rich.

                           HARLAN
             They say money doesn't buy
             happiness.

                           WADE
             They probably don't have any.

                                                    15.

INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sam and her kids listen to the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Money pays for kids to go to
          college. It pays the mortgage.


INT. DINER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF.
Locals chow down. The RADIO BLARES in the b.g.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          It puts food on the table.
          Haven't the people of this town
          lived hand-to-mouth for long
          enough?


INT. BARBERSHOP (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

FLOYD and LEROY are the Jurassic era barbers. Floyd cuts
Leroy's hair. The two men listen to the RADIO.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          We're all gonna die in this hell
          hole.

                        FLOYD
          Yeah, of boredom.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

DEPUTY PETE sits with his feet up on the desk reading
Playstation magazine. He listens to the RADIO.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Wouldn't it be nice not to worry
          about surviving retirement? Or
          taking a shot at that life-long
          dream?


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

                        WADE
          Think about it, Harlan, you could
          buy a commercial transmitter and
          start broadcasting to a national
          audience.

                        HARLAN
          It would be nice to get the
          message out. Let people know the
          aliens walk among us.

                                                     16.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

Chris slows to a stop in front of the McCormick and Son
Mining Company. This stately edifice was once the
driving force behind the local economy.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          If Chris McCormick refuses to sell
          his mines. The rest of us are out
          of luck.

Chris frowns.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

                        WADE (V.O.)
          I don't think it's fair for one
          person to wield that much power.
          But he's just like his father.
          Selfish. Greedy. And more than a
          little bit nuts.

                          SAM
          Uh-oh.

Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates.


INT. DINER - DAY

The locals stop eating and look toward the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          That family has been digging in
          those tunnels since the twenties.
          If there was something down there,
          don't you think they would have
          found it by now?


INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY

Floyd and Leroy stare at the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Common sense does not apply to
          crazy people.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Might as well be chasing a
          leprechaun's pot of gold at the
          end of the rainbow.

Chris is furious as he PEELS OUT and speeds toward
Harlan's.


INT. DINER - DAY

The locals watch Chris's pickup speed by.

                           WADE (V.O.)
             ... lunatics...


INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY

Floyd and Leroy watch Chris speed by.

                           WADE (V.O.)
             ... certifiably nuts...


INT. POLICE CAR - (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

As Sam pulls into town. She sees Chris skid to a stop in
front of Harlan's trailer. He leaps out of his pickup.

                           WADE (V.O.)
             ... at the very least...


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Chris yanks the door open in time to hear...

                           WADE
             ... those McCormicks are just
             plain-old dumb.

Wade stands up to protest. But it's too late. Chris
punches him in the nose. The mayor tumbles back.

                           CHRIS
             I've warned you not to talk about
             my family!

                           HARLAN
             We have a surprise guest in the
             studio.

Chris drags Wade to his feet, shoving him against the
wall.

                           CHRIS
             My family built this town!

CONTINUED:

                           WADE
             Am I supposed to be grateful?

Chris draws back his fist for another shot.       Sam runs in
and grabs him from behind.

                              SAM
             That's enough!

                           CHRIS
             Stay out of this, Sam!

She manhandles Chris toward the door.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Practically the entire town has gathered outside. Sam
drags Chris through the door. Wade and Harlan are close
behind.

                           CHRIS
             Did you hear what he said?

                              SAM
             I heard.

                           WADE
             I want him locked up!

                           SAM
             Let's all calm down.

Wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience.

                           WADE
             We have no economy! People are
             barely scraping by! And now we've
             been offered the deal of a
             lifetime. You don't have the
             right to stand in our way!

                           CHRIS
             Those mines are full of gas. One
             spark in the wrong place could
             blow this entire valley sky high.
             Do you really want to load that
             gun with toxic waste?

                           WADE
             Chem-Tech did seismic analysis,
             vapor checks, groundwater reads,
             soil sampling. They found
             isolated methane pockets, but no
             benzene or hydrogen sulfide.

             How could they run tests? I
             didn't give them permission to go
             into the mines.

Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer.

                           CHRIS
             I asked you a question, you greedy
             son of a bitch!

                           WADE
             I'm greedy?! You're the one
             keeping us down so you can search
             for gold!

Chris tries to go after Wade.       Sam holds him back.

                           SAM
             Don't take another step.

Chris stares at her.

                           CHRIS
             You're taking his side?

                           SAM
             I'm trying to keep the peace.

                             WADE
             You're crazy!    Just like your
             father!

Wade drives off in his humvee.       The crowd begins to
disperse.

                            CHRIS
                    (sotto)
             He wasn't crazy.

                             SAM
             It's okay.

Chris heads off to his truck. Sam watches him go. Her
eyes drifting down his body. Ashley steps up beside her
mom.

                           ASHLEY
             Maybe you're not gay after all.

             Where did you learn that it's okay

                          ASHLEY
             Relax, Mom. He's hot for an old
             guy. I can admit it. Why can't
             you?

Sam watches Chris get into his truck. He gives her one
last look before pulling out. Sam smiles with her
daughter.


INT. MINING MUSEUM (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

Vintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone
photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines.

GLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke
from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner.
Ignoring the signs behind her head: "NO SMOKING!",
"DANGER GAS!"

As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a
drawer.

                           GLADYS
             Did you pop him one?

                           CHRIS
             He had it comin'. But Sam
             Palmer... That woman abuses her
             power.

                           GLADYS
             Why? Because she stopped you from
             givin' Wade another pop?

                           CHRIS
             I'm not proud of it.

Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that
honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked
"explored." Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel
off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys.
Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open
and puts out the flame.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           21.

CONTINUED:

                           CHRIS
             I thought you were trying the
             patch.

                           GLADYS
             I am.

She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.
Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum.


INT. MUSEUM - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Chris enters the family living quarters. The furniture
was new in 1947. He continues to the adjacent kitchen.


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Chris takes a beer out of the fridge. Then he notices an
odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner
permanently on "light."

Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He
removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS.

Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.
Gladys enters with a stack of bills.

                           CHRIS
             That burner's on the fritz again.

                            GLADYS
             Oh something's broken? What else
             is new?
                     (lays bills on table)
             You need to pay these by the end
             of the month.

                           CHRIS
                    (looks at bills)
             Today... For a split second... I
             actually thought I had it.

                           GLADYS
             Another vein of iron pyrite?

                           CHRIS
             Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch.
             I practically blew myself up
             trying to get it back.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                     22.

                           GLADYS
             I'm glad you like my bologna
             sandwiches.
                    (beat)
             Maybe you should talk to Wade.

                           CHRIS
             What are you saying?

                           GLADYS
             Honey, if he really does have a
             buyer...

                           CHRIS
             You of all people know how much my
             dad wanted to find that mother
             lode.

                           GLADYS
             Your daddy wanted to    get rich. I
             don't think he cared    how that
             happened. If he was     still alive,
             maybe he'd sell those    mines.

Chris takes umbrage...

                           CHRIS
             And maybe you didn't know him so
             well after all.

A tense beat.

                           GLADYS
             You're right... I'm just worried
             about how we're going to pay these
             bills.

                           CHRIS
             Don't give up on me, Gladys. I
             promised him I'd find the gold.
             And I will.

Gladys steels her fear, patting Chris on the hand.


EXT. TOWN - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAWN

The sun rises.     The town slowly comes to life.

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             Good morning, Prosperity, Nevada.
             It's another beautiful day on the
             frontier.

Locals prepare their stores for business.

                                                          23.

INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          No charges have been filed in
          yesterday's fracas between Chris
          McCormick and Wade Hale. And
          we've got...

Joshua turns the radio down. He holds a tape measure to
a glass spider tank, recording the size of an unseen
arac.

                        JOSHUA
          An exponential growth rate...
          That's impossible.

                         CHARLIE
          Me so horny.   Me love you long
          time.

Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its
perch.

                        JOSHUA
          Be quiet, bird!

Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching
curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one
of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to
investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around
the back of the tank.

                        CHARLIE
          Charlie's in the wire!     Incoming!

Something yanks the parrot O.S.

                        JOSHUA
          Stop screwing around...!

Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices
several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads
over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to
reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No
sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of
the tank.

                        JOSHUA
          Where'd you go? Consuela?

She's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots      something
sticking out from under the table. Two      parrot feet.
Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table. It's a
horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing.
His body desiccated.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          24.

CONTINUED:

                           JOSHUA
             Charlie... Semper fidelis.

Joshua sees Charlie is attached to a web. He tugs on the
webline. Something tugs back. Joshua leans down to look
under the table. His eyes go wide at what he sees. Then
a shadow looms over his head. Joshua looks up and...


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

SCREAMS and the sounds of BREAKING GLASS come from
within.


EXT. PALMER HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY

Ranch style.    Cop car in front.     Chris's pickup cruises
by.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK - OUTSIDE PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Chris drives past.    He catches sight of a figure in a
window.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Sam is brushing her teeth at the window as Chris drives
by. They make eye contact. Chris moves on. Sam looks
at herself in the mirror. Bathrobe. No makeup. Messy
hair. Mouth full of toothpaste.

                              SAM
             Work it, babe.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Sam comes out of the bathroom dressed in her uniform.

                           SAM
             It's all yours.

Ashley and Mike exit their rooms. Mike is dressed for
the day. Ashley in a robe. They race for the bathroom.
Mike is first. Then Ashley hip-checks him out of the
way, slamming the door in his face.

                              ASHLEY (O.S.)
             Ladies first.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           MIKE
             What's your excuse!?

Sam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall.

                           SAM
             You still want a ride, Mike?

                           MIKE
             I'm just going to the mall.

                           SAM
             Have fun.

Mike heads down the hallway and out of the house.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs
in.


INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

Ashley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta
rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather
cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is
oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of
her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the
soap.

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather
builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once
more. The spider returns across its web right in front
of her eyes.

The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no
water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching
with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the
spider scurries onto its opposite side.

Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can
strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.

The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the
beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on
the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it
was there.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     26.

CONTINUED:

Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks
the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again.
The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders
pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in
horror.

Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower
door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little
spiders.

                          SAM
             Now what?

Ashley just screams.


INT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - DAY

The SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of
remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover
furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur.

A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching
something intently. The cat charges into the wall after
unseen prey.

EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She
clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop.
He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPS
CUTTING.

                           EMMA
             Why do you need to do that as six
             in the morning!? Do you hate me
             that much!?

                           HANK
             I want to finish before I go to
             work.

                           EMMA
             You've been saying that for six
             months!

                           HANK
             I can't finish if you keep
             interrupting!

Hanks RESTARTS the SAW as Emma staggers into the kitchen.

                                                         27.

INT. REMODELED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Emma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco,
lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. All of it goes into
the BLENDER. She FIRES it UP. Competing with the noise
of Hank's SAW. Then Emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat
food.


INT. REMODELED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Emma comes back in and UNPLUGS the noisy SAW.

                        HANK
          If you're gonna keep pulling the
          plug...

                        EMMA
          Have you seen Zeke this morning?

                        HANK
          He was chasing something earlier.

                        EMMA
          If he got into the wall again,
          it's your balls in the blender.

They hear FAINT MEOWING. Hank traces the source.       It's
coming from behind a partially-dismantled wall.

                         HANK
          Hey, Zeke.   Breakfast is ready.

                        EMMA
          I'll get the tuna.

Emma heads back into the kitchen. Hank listens at the
wall. After a beat he hears the CAT RUSTLING around
inside.

                           HANK
          Zeke?

Emma re-enters with a can of tuna.       She hears ZEKE HISS.

                        EMMA
          What's wrong with him?

Hank shakes his head. The CAT noises become more
aggressive. The panicked couple tries to follow the
cat's progress. They tracks the sounds of BATTLE along
the wall. The noises become FRANTIC. SCRABBLING CLAWS.
HOWLS of KITTY pain.

                           HANK & EMMA
          Zeke!?   Zeke!    Zeke!

                                                       28.

CONTINUED:

They follow the cat's frenzied movement up the wall,
across the ceiling, and down the other wall. Hank
hurries over. He can feel his cat thrashing maniacally
on the other side. A FELINE SCREAM. And then deafening
silence.

Hank tears open the drywall, reaching for his cat.

                           HANK
             I've got him by the tail.

He withdraws all that remains of the Zeker... a bloody
tail.


EXT. MALL - DAY

Mike hops off his bike before it stops moving. Letting
it crash in the dirt. He enters the mall through glass
doors.


INT. MALL (PROSPERITY) - DAY

Mike passes NORMAN (18), a janitor polishing the floors.
Norman listens to LOUD DEATH ROCK TUNES on a Sony
WALKMAN.

                           NORMAN
                    (conspiratorial)
             Hey, dude. Yeah. You.

Mike comes over to this goatee'd rascal.

                           NORMAN
             Wanna buy some smoke?

                           MIKE
             A pack of cigarettes?

                           NORMAN
             Smoke to get high, not to die. My
             stuff is hydroponically grown in a
             top secret location. No
             artificial flavors. No
             preservatives. Just 110 percent
             homegrown.

                           MIKE
             Where's this secret location?

CONTINUED:

                           NORMAN
             I could have a dime bag for you
             toot sweet. But if I tell you
             where exactly, I'd have to kill
             you.

                           MIKE
             Norman, you know my mom's the
             sheriff.

                           NORMAN
             Oh yeah... Right on...
                    (considers this)
             Does she get high?

Mike walks away, deeper into the mall. A dozen stores
line the hallway: Victoria's Secret, Electronic
Boutique, Sport Chalet. Most of the stores are closed
for good. A large atrium features a fountain and jungle
gym. Skylights cover the ceiling. Mike enters the Home
and Garden store.


INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE - DAY

Mike goes up to the counter.          The CLERK snaps at him.

                           CLERK
             The bug spray is on aisle five!

                              MIKE
             What?

                           CLERK
             You want mousetraps!?       Is that
             it?! Aisle five!

Mike grabs some batteries and lays them on the counter.

                              CLERK
             Oh.     I thought you wanted...

An OLD LADY walks past.

                           OLD LADY
             Excuse me, young man. Where can I
             find the bug spray?

                              CLERK
             Aisle five!

The Clerk grabs the PA's microphone.

             All bug spray, rodent traps, ant
             poison and fly paper is on aisle
             five!

He returns his attention to Mike.

                           CLERK
             That'll be three fifty-two.

Mike pays the man.

                           MIKE
             Where's aisle five?

The annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the
aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few
remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off.


EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY

Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her
vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid
object is coughed up through the hose.

Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified
objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking
the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then
inexplicably stops.

Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of
the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now
she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks
deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.

Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She
puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object
comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another.
And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth.

Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out
of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.

Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She
vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small
spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches
them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream...
but can only retch.

                                                        31.

EXT. STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Mike Palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water. He
sees Beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden. Mike
it thoroughly grossed out.


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

Mike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.    He
dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.     Mike heads
inside.


INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Mike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE
BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows.
Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos.

                         MIKE
          Hello?   Joshua? Charlie?

The spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their
occupants. Mike pulls out his Cassiopeia PDA and starts
recording.

                        MIKE
                 (into PDA)
          Captain's log. Stardate...

Stops recording, PLAYS it BACK, listens to HIS VOICE.

                           MIKE
          Cool!
                 (records again)
          The house is deserted. No sign of
          Joshua Taft or his bird. The
          spider tanks are shattered. There
          is broken glass everywhere.

Mike moves toward the back door of the cabin.    It swings
open and shut in the WIND.


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - BACK YARD - DAY

Mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized
footprints. He follows these tracks to a cluster of
wooden barricades labeled: "McCORMICK AND SONS MINING
COMPANY." Mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind
the barriers.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       32.

                           MIKE
                    (into PDA)
             Animal tracks. Definitely too big
             to be spiders. Could be rats.

Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to
the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too
dark.

Mike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never
realizing...

Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the
shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs
from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing.
Grisly.

Suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper
into the shaft by some unseen creature.


EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris's pickup is parked outside another mine shaft.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAY

Chris works with   his pick-axe. He pauses, listening to a
DISTURBING NOISE   somewhere down the tunnel. A growl? A
roar? Chris isn'   t so sure. And then a new sound... a
SCREECHING. The    noise grows LOUDER. Something's coming.

Chris shines his light into the darkness. Trying to see
what's causing the unsettling crescendo...

Suddenly dozens of RATS burst from the darkness.


EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris runs out the mouth of the tunnel. The rat stampede
is on his tail. He leaps into the back of his pickup.
The manic rodents continue off into the desert.

Chris looks back toward the gaping mouth of the tunnel.

                           CHRIS
             What am I, the Pied Piper...

                                                        33.

EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - BARBER SHOP - DAY

Mike rides his bike. Floyd the barber stands out front
chatting with an elderly couple. They hold a dog's leash
in their hand.

                         FLOYD
          I'm sorry.   I haven't seen him.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Mike rides on. He notices a guy taping a flyer to a lamp
post. Mike glances over. It's a sign for a missing dog.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - POLICE STATION - DAY

Mike arrives at the local police station. Several cars
are parked out front. The door is ajar. Locals are
crowded inside. Mike lets his bike crash as he enters.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sam is behind her desk.   The place is swarming with
locals.

                         SAM
          Quiet!   Quiet please!

The mob is not listening.

                        BEVERLY
          They were clogging up my house!

                        EMMA
          I want to know what killed Zeke!

                        TRAVIS
          He was a good dog! He wouldn't
          just get up and go!

Deputy Pete whistles at top volume.   Everybody shuts up.

                        SAM
          I had spiders at my house too.     We
          need an exterminator not a
          sheriff.

                        TRAVIS
          What about my dog?

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                     34.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             I don't know, Travis. We're gonna
             keep an eye out. But we're not
             gettin' anywhere like this. You
             should go back out there and look
             for your animals. If they haven't
             shown up by tonight. I'll call
             Fish and Game. Okay?

Pete ushers the grumbling mob out of the office.   Mike
avoids the crush and manages to stay inside.

                           MIKE
             Mom! Mom!   All Josh's spiders are
             gone!

                           SAM
             I can't do this right now, Mike!
             Everyone's having pest problems!

                           MIKE
             But Joshua is gone!

                           SAM
             Maybe he's out looking for his
             spiders?

                           MIKE
             Mom, I'm serious! You're not
             listening!

                           SAM
             Mike... I've got missing pets.
             Spiders in the plumbing. Rats and
             mice coming out of basements. And
             your sister's about to end up on a
             milk carton. I can't have you
             losing...

The PHONE RINGS.     Sam answers it.

                           SAM
             Hello? Wade... wait a second...
             your ostriches?

OFF Mike's look.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Prosperity is clearly visible just a mile away. The
police car drives down a long road lined with fences.

                                                       35.

EXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Wade's new Hummer is in the driveway. A CATTLE DOG BARKS
as Wade leads Sam and Mike around the side of the house.

                        WADE
          Came out to feed my birds this
          morning.

                         SAM
          Coyotes?

                         WADE
          Hell no!

The trio steps to the fence.    Only three mangy ostriches
are there to greet them.

                        WADE
          My flock had fifty birds! Where'd
          they go, dammit! Who the hell
          steals fifty birds that can't even
          fly!?

                        SAM
          All this happened last night?

                         WADE
          I guess.   And we didn't hear a
          thing.

Sam gestures toward the BARKING DOG.

                        SAM
          What about him?

                         WADE
          Not a peep.

Mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground.     He
heads over for a closer look.

The DOG watches his progress.    BARKING excitedly.

Sam talks to Wade.

                        SAM
          How's the ostrich business?

                        WADE
          Not so good lately.

                        SAM
          You've got that new Hummer. You
          must be makin' enough to pay for
          it.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                           WADE
                    (annoyed)
             You like it? I'll take you for a
             ride.

                           SAM
             These birds are insured.   Right?

                           WADE
             I didn't kill my birds, Sam.      Is
             that what you think?

Mike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade.

                           WADE
                    (in the distance)
             ... reject... absolutely not...

Mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks
that he found at Joshua's. But this time they are
larger:

                           MIKE
                    (into PDA)
             I've found more tracks.    Even
             larger now.

Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance.
This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go
there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of
ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.

Mike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right.
An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the
edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts.
A sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt. Mike is
able to lift it.

Mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide.


INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - DAY

Twenty feet down the shaft.     A shape moves.

A dark shape inches up the burrow toward Mike.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY

Mike is oblivious as he peers into the dark.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

The BARKING CATTLE DOG SNAPS its TETHER and charges Mike.
Sam and Wade see this and run after it.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY

Mike doesn't see the dog.    He's too busy looking in the
hole.


INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - TRAPDOOR SPIDER POV - MIKE

The kid is FRAMED IN the burrow opening just a few feet
away.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY

Mike senses something approaching in the darkness.
Suddenly he's grabbed from behind. Sam drags him away as
CLYDE the cattle dog continues BARKING.

                        WADE
                 (to Clyde)
          Now you're on the job?! What the
          hell were you doin' last night?!

                           SAM
          Come on, Mike.     Let's hit it.

Sam leads her son toward the house.     Mike glances back.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Mike and Sam are in the cop car.     Wade is at Sam's
window.

                        WADE
          I need to know what happened to my
          birds!

             If I find anything I'll let you
             know.
                    (a beat)
             So you can fill out that insurance
             form.

Sam drives down the driveway. Wade takes off his hat and
wipes his brow. He watches Clyde run parallel to the
accelerating police car.


INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Sam eyes the road ahead.     Mike is lost in thought.

                           MIKE
             We have to go back.

                           SAM
             Mike?

                           MIKE
             That was a trapdoor spider's
             burrow.

                           SAM
             What are you talking about?

                           MIKE
             Joshua was feeding his spiders
             bugs from the creek. And they
             were getting bigger.

Mike glances out the window at the dog running nearby.

                           MIKE
                    (agitated)
             What if they didn't stop growing?
             What if they broke out of their
             tanks. Ate Joshua. And went into
             the mines?

Sam looks at him like he's out of his mind.

                           MIKE
             That could be why the other
             species are coming out into the
             open. They're trying to get away
             from the giant spiders.
                    (a beat)
             The ecosystem is out of balance.

             Ritalin?

She checks him for a fever.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - FENCE LINE - DAY

CLYDE runs   next to the car. Suddenly he disappears
underground   with a YELP. Only still frame on a DVD
player will   capture the trapdoor spider's lunge from a
camouflaged   den. The dog's empty collar rolls to a stop
in a cloud   of dust.


INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Mike turns from his mother and looks out the window.        He
is confused when he doesn't see any sign of the dog.

                           MIKE
             Maybe I am losing it...

He checks himself for a fever.


INT. ABANDONED TRUCK STOP (DESERT) - DAY

A dingy collection of buildings surrounded by dunes and
rock. The structures have boarded windows. Graffiti on
the walls. Teenagers hang out. Off-road motorcycles
parked nearby.

Bret Hale's monster truck does donuts in the parking lot.
Ashley hangs out the passenger window shrieking with
glee.


INT. BRET'S TRUCK (TRUCK STOP) - DAY

Bret smokes a Phillies Blunt as he donuts his TRUCK.
Ashley laughs hysterically. Bret steers them around to
the back of the truck stop. He SKIDS to a stop.

                           ASHLEY
             Woo-hoo!

Bret offers his stogie.    Ashley refuses.     Bret puffs
away.

                           ASHLEY
             Haven't you had enough of that?

He coughs and they both laugh.

                           BRET
             When I medal at the X-Games, Honda
             will give me full sponsorship.
             Then I'll take you with me on the
             Supercross tour.

Ashley is silent.

                           BRET
             Are you still thinking about going
             away?

                           ASHLEY
             I don't know. I want to do
             something with my life, Bret.
             Help people. Maybe med school is
             still an option.

                           BRET
             Not if you keep hanging out with
             me.

                              ASHLEY
             Thanks, Mom.

They kiss. Things head toward a serious        level of "get
down." Bret slides his hand up Ashley's        shirt. Ashley
gets into it. But then Bret slides his        hand toward the
buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his        hand.

                              ASHLEY
             Slow down...

Bret persists.       Ashley climbs off of him.

                           BRET
             I thought you loved me.

                              ASHLEY
             I do!

                           BRET
             Then what's the problem? You want
             to leave town. You don't want to
             make out.

             Why didn't you say so? We can go

             around.    You don't have to play
             the good   girl. Let Daddy give you
             what you   really want.

Bret goes after her once more.      Ashley's not into it.

                           ASHLEY
             Please, Bret... Please don't...

But Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to
fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her
stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the
trigger.

Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He
spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the
driver's side door.


EXT. BEHIND TRUCK STOP - DAY

Bret twitches on the ground.

                           BRET
             My balls? Ahh! My balls!
                    (looks down)
             I pissed myself?! Damn, bee-otch!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            42.

CONTINUED:

Ashley watches from the truck.

                           ASHLEY
             I told you to back off!

Ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the
windows.

Bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. Then his eyes
rack-focus to a nearby dune. A Rottweiler-sized jumping
spider stands atop it. Two large eyes surrounded by six
smaller orbs. Orange and black designs on its abdomen.
Wiry hair. Dagger-sized fangs. Bret can't quite believe
what he sees.

Ashley STARTS the TRUCK.      This snaps Bret back to
reality.

                             BRET
             Ashley, wait!

                           ASHLEY
             Screw you, Bret. I'm going home.

Bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune.
He runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open
it.

                            BRET
             Please!   Open the door!     I'm
             sorry!

                           ASHLEY
             I can't believe my mom was right
             about you. Do you know how
             embarrassing that is?

Ashley starts to pull away.         Bret keeps banging on the
glass.

                           BRET
             Open the door, baby!      I love you!
             I want to marry you!      Have my
             children! Please!

Ashley flips him the bird and BURNS RUBBER. As the truck
moves out of the way, Bret finds himself staring at
several more jumping spiders that are methodically
approaching. Bret sprints around to the other side of
the truck stop.

                                                         43.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bret runs from behind the building.    Larry Witzer and a
bunch of other kids see him coming.

                          LARRY
            Dude, did you piss in your pants?

                           RANDY
            Ha-ha!   Bret pissed his pants!

All the kids start laughing and pointing at Bret.      None
of them see the approaching jumping spiders.

                          BRET
            Get out of here! They're coming!

                          RANDY
            The only one coming is you, dude.

Larry and Randy high-five. A jumping spider lands on
Randy's back, piercing him with its fangs, throwing him
to the ground. Randy screams. The kids have a front-row
seat as the spider's pincers mash their buddy into an
edible pulp.

Bret leaps onto his MOTORCYCLE and FIRES it UP. Several
more jumping spiders bound across the parking lot.

                           BRET
            Ride!

The kids scramble, leaping onto their bikes. One rider
is picked off by a spider. The others kick up rooster
tails as they accelerate away. The spiders chase them
into the dunes.


EXT. SAND DUNES - DAY

A wasteland on the outskirts of town. The sandy waves
are "surfed" by the noisy MOTORCYCLES. The jumping
spiders keep after them, leaping a dozen feet in a single
bound.

A biker is ripped off a motorcycle.     The BIKE CRASHES.

Larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. Another biker
tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into
the motorcycle's spokes. The spider gets munched. But
then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a
hungry jumper.

Larry continues riding. But a spider lands on his back
and sinks fangs into his spine. Larry yells bloody
murder.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        44.

CONTINUED:

Bret sees Larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand.
Bret is the only human left. A jumper comes after him in
mid-air. Bret does an X-Games style rocket air, kicking
backward with booted legs. He knocks the spider away and
keeps on riding.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Three familiar trucks cruise down the highway.     This time
they are devoid of any toxic waste cargo.


INT. THIRD TRUCK - HIGHWAY - DAY

Pig Pen stares fixedly at the endless road ahead of him.

                           SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
             I will live every moment of my
             life as if it were my last.

                           PIG PEN
             I will live every moment of my
             life as if it were my last.

Suddenly Bret Hale wheelies across the road. A jumping
spider explodes against the windshield. Spider guts
splatter everywhere. Pig Pen screams as he JAMS on the
BRAKES.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The TRUCK jack-knifes into a line of telephone poles.
Knocking them over and rolling multiple times before
EXPLODING. Several jumping spiders are caught in the
blast. Bret Hale rides on with several more jumpers
behind.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - MIKE'S ROOM - DAY

The black and white classic: Tarantula, plays over an
old TV and VCR. Mike is at his computer, downloading a
spider encyclopedia into his PDA. A message flashes
across the screen: CONNECTION LOST. Mike picks up the
telephone.

                               MIKE
             Hello?   Hello?

The line is dead.

                                                     45.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Bret rides into a dead-end canyon with the spiders very
close behind. Bret steers for the mouth of a hillside
mine shaft.


INT HORIZONTAL MINE SHAFT - DAY

Bret speeds inside. He looks over his shoulder to check
for his pursuers, they're gone. Bret looks relieved. He
faces forward as... whack! A support beam knocks him
from his bike. The bike continues on into the tunnel
alone. From the sound of things it travels pretty far
before crashing.

Bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face.
He looks up at a support beam which begins to crack.
Bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing
him in the mine.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Several locals put up more signs for missing pets.


INT. DINER/EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Harlan is kibitzing with Travis. Pete and Emma console
each other over dessert. Wade sits alone at a table for
two. The attractive WAITRESS on roller-skates give him a
fresh beer.

                        WAITRESS
          The phones went down for some
          reason. Maybe that's why Bret
          didn't call. Did you want to go
          ahead and order?

                        WADE
          Just give me the usual.

                        WAITRESS
          One ostrich steak, comin' up.

Wade reacts glumly to the word "ostrich."


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Gladys smokes as she puts together the fixings for a
large meal. She has a cookbook out. Pots and pans.
Chris enters. Gladys quickly drops her cigarette in the
disposal.

                           CHRIS
             Need some rat traps.

                           GLADYS
             Try the basement.

                           CHRIS
             What is all this?

                           GLADYS
             I wanted to surprise you with a
             special dinner. Turkey De La
             Gladys.

                           CHRIS
             I'll have mine without Nicotine.

                           GLADYS
             Not as good that way.

Chris goes through a nearby door to the basement.


INT. MUSEUM - BASEMENT - DAY

Chris comes downstairs. He rummages through some junk.
comes up with several rat traps. He turns around to
discover an odd hole in the wall. He ventures over for a
look.

                           CHRIS
             Rats...

Chris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his
entry.

Chris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large
male tarantula on his back. Chris is oblivious as he
takes off his jacket. The coat lands in a heap atop the
spider.

Chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in
the hole. He doesn't notice the jacket moving behind
him.

Chris backs out of the hole. He picks up his jacket.
The spider is gone. He grabs his traps and heads
upstairs.

                                                       47.

INT. MUSEUM - DAY

Chris passes through the kitchen.    He eyes Gladys warily.

                        CHRIS
          Have you been smoking?

                        GLADYS
          No.

Smoke pours out of her nostrils.

                        CHRIS
          Gladys...

                        GLADYS
          Get back to work. I'll see you
          tonight.

Chris starts out.

                        GLADYS
          Sam called for you.

Chris hesitates.

                        GLADYS
          She wants you to come by the
          station.

                        CHRIS
          She really has it in for me.

                        GLADYS
          Oh please.

                        CHRIS
          What?

                        GLADYS
          You two should just sleep together
          and get it over with.

                        CHRIS
          Me and Sam... Hook up...

                         GLADYS
          I may be older than electricity,
          but I used to be a nice-looking
          piece of tail.

                        CHRIS
          Too much information.

                           GLADYS
             I'm not kidding. I got more
             action than those chicks on VIP.
             So when I tell you Sam thinks your
             butt is U.S.D.A. choice...

                           CHRIS
             This is where I throw up.

                           GLADYS
             Don't tell me you don't think
             she's a fox.

Chris mulls this over.   Testing his own feelings. He
opens his mouth to ask another question. And then heads
out.

                           GLADYS
             See you for dinner.

Gladys doesn't notice the basement DOOR CREAK open
slightly.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sam is on the phone at her desk.

                           SAM
             Nothing yet. I'm sorry.     We're
             still trying to get...

Chris enters.

                           SAM
             Let me call you back.
                    (hangs up)
             This has been one crazy day.
             We've got missing pets, dead
             ostriches. God only knows what's
             next.

                           CHRIS
             I'm sorry about yesterday. Wade
             is... He knows how to push my
             buttons.

                           SAM
             I wanted to ask you...

                           CHRIS
             On a date?

Sam freezes for a second.     Chris laughs.

                            CHRIS
             I'm kidding.   What did you want to
             ask?

                           SAM
             Have you noticed anything strange
             in the mines?

                           CHRIS
             Define strange.

                           SAM
             I had spiders in my house. Hector
             had roaches in his basement. Some
             mice...

                           CHRIS
             How about stampeding rats?

                           SAM
             Were they running away from
             something?

                           CHRIS
             Could have been. Never saw them
             do that before. I guess it
             qualifies as strange.

Sam thinks this over.

                           CHRIS
             Sam... Do you want to go out
             sometime?

                           SAM
                    (taken aback)
             Are you asking me out on a date?

                           CHRIS
             Only if you're going to say yes.

Sam smiles slightly.


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

The basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a
bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip.

A male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature
is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank
dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters.
Hair all over.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        50.

CONTINUED:

Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As
she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider
is about to strike, she goes another direction to get
spices, utensils, a pan.

Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the
tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her.
Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys
grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she
stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner
knobs, turning on the gas.

Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks
back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she
goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.

Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the
webline prevents her from slotting it home.

Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the
fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see
the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The
tarantula is engulfed in    flame.

Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her
back when a second male tarantula nails her with a
webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the
floor toward the basement door.

The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

                           CHRIS

             My kids are the world to me,
             Chris. When their dad left... it
             really took a toll. On all of us.
             I can't go through that again. I
             won't.

OFF Chris's look.


EXT. BURNING MUSEUM - DAY

The museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks
the conflagration. All the locals are there to help.

Sam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares
at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the
inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to
the ground.

                            CHRIS
             No!   Let me go! Gladys!   Let me
             go!

The museum collapses.     Chris watches it burn to the
ground.


EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a
smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups.

Chris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up. He
picks something out of the char.     The map of the mines.
Almost completely burned. Soaked     with water. He stares
at it for a heavy beat. All that     remains of his legacy.
Sam steps up.

                           SAM
             Maybe she got out.

Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.

                            CHRIS
                     (devastated)
             She was cooking. The stove was
             broken.

                           SAM
             Why don't you come home with me?
             We'll get you cleaned up.

Chris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map
fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the
edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It's a
piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider's leg. Big.
Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away.

                           TRAVIS
             Get away from there, Mike!

Mike hurries clear with his prize. He puts it on the
ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale
of the leg.

                             MIKE
             Holy God...

Mike looks around for his mom.         He sees her driving off
in the cop car with Chris.

                             MIKE
             Mom!   Wait!


EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DUSK

The sun hangs low in the sky.         Sam's cop car parks beside
Bret's monster truck.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Ashley watches TV. A doctor resuscitates a dying patient
with CPR. The doctor counts as he pumps the man's chest.

                           TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
             One... two... three...

Ashley watches intently.       The patient is revived.

                           TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
             Helping people never gets old.

Ashley hears KEYS in the front DOOR. She quickly
switches channels to MTV. Sam enters with Chris.

                             SAM
             Is Bret here?

                             ASHLEY
             No.

                           SAM
             Then why is his truck out front?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             53.

CONTINUED:

                           ASHLEY
             Don't worry about it.

                           SAM
             What do you mean?     What happened?

                            ASHLEY
             Nothing.

Ashley starts crying. Sam goes to comfort her daughter.
Chris stands by in shock. Watching, Upset.

                           ASHLEY
             Nothing happened, alright!

Ashley runs off to her room.       Sam follows.

Chris stands alone for a beat. He walks to the kitchen
and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer. He puts
the cold bottle against his head and neck. Trying to
cool off.

Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of
exoskeleton. He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka.

                           MIKE
             Spiders shed their skins when they
             grow.

Chris looks at Mike for a moment.

                            MIKE
             Like snakes.

                           CHRIS
             Gladys is dead.

Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle.

                            MIKE
             Maybe not.

That got Chris's attention.

                           MIKE
             This is a tarantula's leg. Or it
             was. It's an exoskeleton, to be
             scientific.

                           CHRIS
             It's a little large.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             54.

CONTINUED:

Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his
Cassiopeia full of spider data. He shows Chris a video
of a male tarantula mummifying its food. Chris watches
in amazement.

                           MIKE
             See! Male tarantulas wrap their
             prey in webbing. Tight like a
             mummy. The food stays alive so
             they can eat it later.

Sam enters the room in time to overhear this.

                             SAM
             Mike, please.    Now isn't the time.

Chris looks up at Sam.

                           CHRIS
             They keep their food alive.

Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton.

                             SAM
             What is this?

                           MIKE
             A spider's leg!

Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor.

                             MIKE
             Careful!

                           SAM
             No. That's a piece of cactus.
             Look... It's covered with spines.

                           MIKE
             Those are quills! Tarantulas can
             flick them at you like darts!

Mike does an odd flicking motion.       Kind of like a dog
scratching a flea.

                           SAM
             Giant tarantulas?

                           MIKE
             Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors!
             Joshua had a ton of exotics!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           55.

CONTINUED:

                           CHRIS
             If there were giant spiders
             roaming the desert, don't you
             think somebody would've seen them
             by now?

                           MIKE
             The jumpers hunt in daylight. But
             not the others. They only come
             out when the sun goes down!

The group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the
sky.


EXT. TOWN - DUSK

Prosperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances
are clearly visible. Like black holes of malevolent
promise.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes.
Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's
clothes.

                           SAM
             I guess I should watch more
             'Oprah.' It must be a textbook
             'no-dad' kind of thing.

Chris shifts awkwardly.     In shock.   Sad.   Sam holds up a
flannel shirt.

                           CHRIS
             That one looks kind of scratchy.

Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it
and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.

                           SAM
             All Jason cared about was getting
             out and starting over. I guess
             that included buying a new
             wardrobe.

Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning
up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't
register Sam ogling his exposed chest.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          56.

CONTINUED:

                           CHRIS
             Gladys thought I should sell...
             but you know... I never wanted to
             get rich. If it was about the
             money, I would have sold out to
             Wade a long time ago.

Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.

                           CHRIS
             I think I just wanted to prove the
             gold was down there. That my
             family wasn't crazy to keep
             looking. Even after we'd lost so
             much. And now... she's gone, too.

                           SAM
             I'm sorry, Chris.

                           CHRIS
             Do you know what I'm trying to
             say?

                           SAM
             It wasn't about spending the gold,
             it was about finding it.

                             CHRIS
             That's right.    That's exactly
             right.

Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's
struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but
catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door.

                           CHRIS
             Remind me never to let you do my
             laundry.

She turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out
from behind the car. Sam stares at him.

                           SAM
             They look great.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - SUNSET

A melancholy N'SYNC ballad plays over a BOOM BOX. Ashley
sits on her bed with her back to the open window. The
sun setting in the distance. She rips up the photographs
of Bret.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       57.

CONTINUED:

Ashley doesn't notice the Great Dane-sized spitting
spider crawling in through her window. It is striped
like a jungle predator.

It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among
Ashley's stuffed animal collection.


INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DUSK

Mike checks the phone. Still dead. He types at his
computer, entering the specification of the piece of
exoskeleton. A digital representation of a spider grows
on his monitor screen. Showing Mike exactly how big the
spider would be after shedding this skin. Mike is
distracted by the LOUD MUSIC coming from Ashley's room.

                           MIKE
             Can't you turn that down?!


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - DUSK

                           MIKE (O.S.)
             I'm doing spider research!

Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,
oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley
grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She
returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with
scissors.

The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it
moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and
mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns
around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes
momentarily.

                            ASHLEY
                    (sotto)
             Spider... Mike... Spider...

Ashley sees her stun gun is on   the dresser. She lunges
for it. She's almost got it.     The spider squirts two
lines of gummy web at Ashley.    The glop hits her int he
chest, carries her backward.    Glues her to the wall.


INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Chris finishes   dressing. He faces Sam. There is an odd
moment as they   find themselves standing close. If the
circumstances   were different they'd probably end up
kissing. And    then they hear ASHLEY'S bloodcurdling
SCREAM.

                                                     58.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Mike pops out of his door. Sam and Chris run down the
hallway. Sam yanks open the door to Ashley's room.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sam, Chris and Mike stand in the doorway staring at a
giant spider menacing Ashley. The spitter fires another
webby blast, sticking the girl's legs to the wall.

                         MIKE
          Wow!   A scytodes spitter!

Chris pushes past Sam and Mike. He grabs a chair and
shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer. The spider
backs off. Sam takes off running down the hallway.

                        ASHLEY
          Where are you going?


INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam runs up to find a gun case. She tries to get a
shotgun, but finds it locked. She doesn't have the key.
Sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to
pieces.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris has the chair in one hand to fend off the spider.
With the other hand he tries to get Ashley out of the
webbing. Mike stands nearby reading from his Cassiopeia.

                        MIKE
          The scytodes spits a gooey
          discharge to immobilize their
          prey.

                         ASHLEY
          No shit!

The spider hits Chris's chair with a blast of webbing.
The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall.
Chris stands weaponless before the spider.

                        ASHLEY
          Use my stun g...

Ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo.
Mouth sealed shut. Chris reaches under the bed and
pushes it over on to the spitter. The spider leaps clear
onto the wall.

                                           (CONTINUED)

             Watch its fangs! The spitter's
             fangs move from side to side as it
             fires!

                           CHRIS
             I'll keep that in mind.

Chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the
wall. The spider turns to fight. Chris wrestles it to
the ground. He sees the fangs begin to move from side to
side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot.


INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning
roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its
binding. She grabs the bang stick and runs from the
room.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He
looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the
spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung
across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of
his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab
for his scissors. He gets them.

                           MIKE
             Get under it! Stab it in the
             abdomen! They don't have any
             armor down there!

                           CHRIS
             How am I supposed to do that!?

The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair.
Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the
door with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts.

                           CHRIS
             I'm gonna need some new pants.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then
pops a fresh clip into her 9mm. Chris comes out of the
garage wearing clean clothes. Sam chucks him the pistol.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           CHRIS
             I'm a fast learner.

Chris tries to put the gun in his pocket. And then his
waistband. But these damn pants are too tight.

Ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair.

                           MIKE
             I told you! I told you all!     But
             nobody ever listens to Mike!
             Still think I'm crazy, Mom?

                           SAM
             I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

Ashley is about to hyperventilate.

                           SAM
             Calm down, baby.

                           ASHLEY
             There aren't enough wine coolers
             in the world to calm me down!

                           SAM
             I won't let anything happen to
             you.

Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun.

                           CHRIS
             What other spiders did Joshua
             have?

Sam checks the phone.     It's dead.

             We need to warn people.

                           CHRIS

             Outside?    You want to go outside?


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - PALMER HOUSE- NIGHT

Chris and Sam open the front door of the house.          Sam
looks one way. Chris the other.

No giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue
onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of
the doorway. They listen to the comforting SOUNDS OF a
SUMMER NIGHT.

                             SAM
             It's okay...

Mike and Ashley move out of the doorway.          Joining the
adults. They move toward the cop car.


EXT. STREETS (TOWN) - NIGHT

The cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows.
Everything appears normal. Although no people are
visible.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Sam, Chris, and the kids move away from the cop car to
the door. They are at the far end of town. All appears
to be normal.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Harlan is broadcasting.

                           HARLAN
             ... I'm saying the invasion has
             already occurred. The aliens are
             among us. But they've taken
             common forms. They hide in plain
             sight.

Harlan is startled as Sam and the others enter with guns.

                           SAM
             We need to make an emergency
             broadcast.

             Giant spider invasion.

Harlan's jaw drops.    Sam takes the microphone.

                           CHRIS
             What are you going to say?   You
             can't tell them the truth.

EXT. STREET (TOWN) - NIGHT

                           SAM (V.O.)
             A pack of rabid coyotes is loose
             in town.

Wolf spiders crawl across rooftops. Spitters scale
buildings Tarantulas lurk in the shadows. Jumpers
scuttle out of the mineshafts. Trapdoors prepare their
burrows.


INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

This funky old couple relaxes in their LaZee-Boys.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             They are extremely dangerous.

The forelegs of a tarantula reach over the top of the
man's recliner, yanking him clean out. The woman is
oblivious as her husband is dragged away across the
floor.


EXT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - NIGHT

Emma bursts out of the front door, screaming
hysterically. Hank is behind her with the SawzAll. A
wolf spider crawls after them from inside the house.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             Arm yourselves with any weapons
             you can find.

Hank raises the saw, overextending the power cable.   He
loses power. Drops the saw and runs for his life.

                                                        63.

INT. BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

Floyd and Leroy use brooms to fend off several wolf
spiders.

                        SAM (V.O.)
          Stay together and head for the
          mall.


INT. DINER - NIGHT

A spider eats the chef. The waitress roller-skates away
from an arachnid. She jumps through the window into the
street.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A family piles into their mini-van. Oblivious to the
jumper hiding in the "way back." They close the door and
drive off.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads.

                          CHRIS
          The mall?

                        SAM
          The walls are concrete and the
          exits have steel gates. We could
          hold an entire army of giant
          spiders from inside.

                        ASHLEY
          You just said giant spider on the
          air.

Sam sees the microphone is keyed.

                        HARLAN
          Now that's great radio!

                        SAM
          Not giant spiders!      I meant to
          say...

Harlan notices long spider legs passing the window.

                          HARLAN
          The aliens!

                                                       64.

EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Sam and the    others spill out of the trailer. They head
for the cop    car. As they get closer, a wolf spider
climbs onto    the car's roof and gnaws on the light bar.
Sam raises    her gun to blast it.

                        MIKE
          Wait, Mom! The noise will attract
          more of them!

                        CHRIS
          Let's try for the mall.

Sam leads the others toward town.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings
up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by
spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten
by spiders.

                        CHRIS
          My truck's at the museum.

                           SAM
          Your keys?

                        CHRIS
          In my other pants.

                           MIKE
          Look out!

The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.    Suddenly
a familiar mini-van races past.

                          HARLAN
          Stop!    Take us with you!

Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees...

The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper.
The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to
pieces. The van crashes.


EXT. POWER LINES (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - NIGHT

A group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They
hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is
suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE.
Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids'
feeding frenzy.

                                                          65.

EXT. ALLEY (TOWN) - NIGHT

A dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out
from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the
wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at
him.

                            WADE
          No!     Please!

The spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.      Wade
climbs out of the dumpster.

                            WADE
          Thank you!

Chris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after
them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade.

                            MIKE
          You stink.

                        WADE
                 (to Ashley)
          Have you seen Bret?

                        ASHLEY
          He was out at the dunes.

                          SAM
          Go ahead.    I've got your butt.

                            CHRIS
          What?

                          SAM
          Your back!    I've got your back!

Chris gives Sam a funny look.       Maybe Gladys was right...


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Sam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups
of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall
the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize
Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating
waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other
locals.


EXT. DESERT (NEAR MALL) - NIGHT

Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their
kids.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            66.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It
grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly
replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS
underground.

                             MIKE
             Trapdoors!    They're all around us!

                           SAM
             How can we spot them?

Mike consults his Cassiopeia.

                           MIKE
             I didn't download that part!

                             ASHLEY
             You dork!

The group wheels at the MUFFLED SOUNDS. They see
nothing. They hear another MUFFLED SCREAM, and the top
of the spider's den pops up. Travis drags himself out of
it.

                           TRAVIS
             Help... me... please...

He is dragged back underground.

The group continues toward the mall entrance. Suddenly a
gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. He goes
cyclic, madly FIRING his GUN into the air as he's dragged
under.

More beasts rise out of their dens.       Reaching for the
humans.

                             CHRIS
             Keep going!

Chris and the others flee toward the mall.          Some of them
SHOOT at the spiders as they run.

Leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. Floyd tries to help but
the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging
him under.

The group clears the trapdoor minefield. But some of the
spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after
them.

                                                       67.

EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other
survivors to the glass doors. The doors are locked.
Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them
desperately.

                        ASHLEY
          There's someone inside!

The group sees Norman the dope dealer janitor approaching
out of the gloom. He's staring at them all curiously.

                          NORMAN
          We're closed.

Sam points her gun at him.   Norman raise his hands in
shock.

                        NORMAN
          Wait! I have a prescription!
          It's for my glaucoma!

                        SAM
          Open this goddamn door!

                          NORMAN
          Yes, ma'am.

Norman unlocks the door and lets the group in.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

The survivors hustle inside. They lock the glass doors
behind them. The spiders are still coming.

                        MIKE
          Get away from the doors!

                        NORMAN
          Be cool, little dude.     They're
          locked.

                        MIKE
          Glass won't stop them!

The spiders begin smashing through the glass doors.
Chris and Sam SHOOT to keep them back. People flee into
the mall.

                          SAM
          The gates!    Close the gates!

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        68.

CONTINUED:

Wade and Norman proceed to lower the slotted steel
security gates. Only problem is: Sam and Chris are on
the other side.

                           ASHLEY
             Mom!

                           MIKE
             Hurry up!

Sam and Chris see the gate coming down. They run for it
and slide underneath just as the gate comes down. A
massive trapdoor slams up against the metal. But the
metal holds.

                           SAM
             Shut the other entrances!

Norman and Chris run toward the opposite end of the mall.


INT. MALL - SOUTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Norman arrive. Spiders are SMASHING through
the GLASS. Chris and Norman bring the gate down. They
back away as more spiders slam against the steel.

                           NORMAN
             Trick or treat.

Chris and Norman head back to join the others.   They
find...


INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE (MALL) - NIGHT

The survivors gather makeshift weapons. Floyd take a
chainsaw off the wall. Norman practices swinging a heavy
sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint
cans. Hank stands before a display of circular buzz
saws.

Chris goes to where Sam doles out the few firearms.

                           CHRIS
             We're sealed up at both ends.

Sam hands Chris a shotgun.    He tries to get the feel of
it.

                           SAM
             You pump the slide to jack in a
             fresh round. Point at your target
             and squeeze.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          69.

CONTINUED:

Chris tries it out, pumping the slide. A shell flies out
the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head.

                           WADE
             Watch it!

                           CHRIS
             Like that?

Sam shakes her head and takes the gun back.       She pulls a
machete off the wall and hands it to Chris.

                           SAM
             Try not to cut yourself.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

The place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege.
Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the
entrances to watch the spiders' every move.


INT. MALL - NORTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT

                           WADE
             Why didn't we see them earlier?

                           MIKE
             For the last time! They can't
             handle the sunlight. They were
             waiting in the mines for the sun
             to go down!

                           CHRIS
             Then at daybreak they'll go back
             inside. We can walk out the front
             door.

                           MIKE
             We won't make it that long.

                           ASHLEY
             They're gonna come in after us?

                           MIKE
             They're growing very fast. They
             need food to sustain that kind of
             development.

                           HANK
             Someone should go out and get
             help.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           70.

CONTINUED:

                             EMMA
             You go, Sam.

                             SAM
             Me?

                           WADE
             You're the sheriff.

                           SAM
             I don't have that many handcuffs.

                           PETE
             What about the police radio?

                           SAM
             You're not goin' back out there,
             Pete. None of us are.

                           CHRIS
             Radio Shack is full of cell
             phones.

                           WADE
             But the signal won't get out of
             the valley. That's why we
             couldn't sell any of the damn
             things.

                             HARLAN
             My antenna...

The group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna
is visible on the skylights that run the length of the
mall.

                           HARLAN
             I could climb up to the top. I
             bet I could get a signal out.

                             WADE
             Great idea.    You should do that.

                           CHRIS
             I'll cover you, Harlan.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam
stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his
shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives
him the shotgun.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          71.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             Are you sure you can handle this?

                           CHRIS
                    (re: pants)
             While I'm gone, do you think you
             could find me a size 32?

                           SAM
             I'll do my best.
                    (a beat)
             Uhh... Do you want to go out
             sometime?  Dinner? Maybe a movie?

Chris takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her
lips.

Wade holds open the nearby access door.

                           WADE
             Hey, loverboy... you've got a town
             to save.

Chris and Harlan head out. Sam watches them disappear
through the door and then returns to the survivors.

                           ASHLEY
             You're not really going to get him
             bigger pants are you?

                           SAM
             No way.


INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan up a tight staircase. The
door at the top is identified as "Roof Access." Wade
reaches the door. The others bunch up behind him.

                           CHRIS
             Don't even think about locking
             this door.

                           WADE
             I'll be right here waiting.

Wade slowly opens the roof door.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris and Harlan step onto the roof with their gear.       No
sign of any spiders.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          72.

CONTINUED:

Wade closes the door behind them and locks it.       Chris and
Harlan aren't happy to hear that LOCK TURN.

They sneak across the roof toward the base of the
antenna.

                           CHRIS
             It looks clear.

Harlan starts climbing. Chris stands guard at the
bottom. Neither of them sees the horde of spiders
climbing up the side of the building toward the roof.


INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - MALL - NIGHT

Mike collects perfume. Packing it into his pockets like
grenades. Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie.

                           ASHLEY
             I didn't know you wore cologne.

                            MIKE
             I don't.   It's spider repellent.

Sam steps in through the door.

                           SAM
             Let's stay together, guys.

                           ASHLEY
                    (holds up a teddy)
             Can I get this?

                            SAM
             Move it!

The kids run out to join their mom.       After they go...

The grill of an air vent is pushed open. A huge spitting
spider pushes its way through. Dropping to the floor.
Another spider follows.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is high up on the antenna. He has a cell phone in
hand. It still indicates: "NO SERVICE." He keeps
climbing.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris sees spiders flood onto the roof.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           73.

CONTINUED:

                           CHRIS
             We've got company!

He tries to COCK the SHOTGUN.        Ejecting a shell out the
side.

                           CHRIS
             This always looks so easy on TV!

Chris gets it figured out just in time to BLAST an
attacking spider. He fades back toward the antenna.
SHOOTING.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan checks the phone.

                           HARLAN
             I've got a signal!

He dials 911.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris is surrounded by spiders.        He starts climbing up
the antenna.

                           CHRIS
             They're coming!


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is on the phone.       He hears...

                              OPERATOR (V.O.)
             911 Emergency.

                           HARLAN
             I'm calling from Prosperity
             Nevada! We're being attacked by
             giant spiders! The entire town
             has been overrun!

Chris yells up to him.

                            CHRIS
             No!   Don't say that!

                           OPERATOR (V.O.)
             This is Emergency Services. Not
             dial-a-joke.

CONTINUED:

CLICK. The LINE GOES DEAD. Chris climbs up beside him.
He FIRES several BLASTS at the approaching spiders.

                              CHRIS
             What happened?

                           HARLAN
             They didn't believe me!

                              CHRIS
             What a shock!     Try again!

The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials.

                              OPERATOR (V.O.)
             911 Emergency.

                           HARLAN
             There was a massive explosion!
             Everybody's dead!

                           OPERATOR (V.O.)
             Sir, your number has been flagged
             as a source of a crank call. I'm
             afraid I must terminate this
             conversation.

CLICK.

                           HARLAN
             She hung up on me!

                              CHRIS
             Climb!

Chris FIRES the SHOTGUN.       The spiders are closing in.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam gazes up at the skylight. She can see the silhouette
of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna. Pursued by
spiders.

                              SAM
                    (sotto)
             Oh my God...

Ashley screams in horror nearby.

                           ASHLEY
             They're inside!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            75.

CONTINUED:

Sam whirls to see Ashley pointing at several spiders
coming out of Victoria's Secret. Sam runs over to fight
them.

                             WADE
             Over here!

He faces off against more spiders coming through the Home
and Garden store.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders
are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS
DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching
arac.

A spider fires a web at Harlan.       Nails the poor guy.   And
drags him off the antenna.

Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.
Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan's hand.

                             CHRIS
             I've got you!

Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris.       They're both about
to be killed unless...

                           HARLAN
             Defend the human race!

                             CHRIS
             No!

Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand. He cannonballs down
into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of the
beasts along with himself.

Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac
and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete and
begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna
upright.

The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The
antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antenna
shakes.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Deputy Pete is standing with Sam and the kids when he's
jerked off his feet and hauled into the maw of an
arachnid.

                               SAM
             Ashley!   Mike!

She sees Mike and Ashley avoid an arac by taking refuge
inside the tunnels of the jungle gym.

Sam FIRES the GUNS like Annie Oakley, putting spiders
down left and right, trying to reach her kids.

Floyd the barber confronts a spider with his chain-saw.

                           FLOYD
             Having a bad hair day?!

The spider charges.     Floyd slices its legs off.

                           FLOYD
             How about a little off the top!

He slices another arac.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Chris dodges a spider's webline.       Several more come at
him.

                           CHRIS
             You're going down!

Chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight.
The antenna keels over. Chris hangs tight as he drops
toward the glass.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam looks up to   see Chris come crashing down through the
skylight on the   antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixty
degree angle.    Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ride
their weblines   down to the floor of the mall.

Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a
hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of the
stores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!

                               MIKE
             Arac attack!

Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides
down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the
bottom. Sam runs to his side.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                      77.

                           SAM
             Did you get help?!    Is anybody
             coming!?

                           CHRIS
             We're on our own!

Sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym.

The waitress roller-skates away from the spiders. She
slaloms clear of several spitters. But gets tackled by a
jumper.


INT. MALL - JUNGLE GYM

Ashley and Mike are hiding.

                           ASHLEY
             I can't stay in here!

Ashley starts to move out   of the tube. She discovers the
end has been covered with   web. She pushes it. Something
on the other side pushes   back. Ashley scrambles back.
Mike is already moving.    The kids flee through the tubes
to get away.

                           ASHLEY
             What are they doing?

                           MIKE
                    (checks Cassiopeia)
             They're trapping us like ants in a
             log! Once they have all the exits
             blocked, they'll come in through
             the last one!

They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a
spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume
grenades at the spider, covering their retreat.

Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.
Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.

                           MIKE
             We've gotta go!

Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.

                           ASHLEY
             Here!

She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider
looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But
it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the
arachnid clear.

                                                       78.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam
finish off the spider and then run with the kids.

Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's
sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider.

Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his
tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand.

                        HANK
          It's tool time!

Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his
chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry
spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the
floor.

Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.    He
stops for a moment to look at the jeans.

                        SAM (O.S.)
          Chris!

Chris continues on.

All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and
prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all
directions.

Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT.
Others use their make-shift weapons.

Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it.    Mike sees this
and gets an idea.

                        MIKE
          Where do you grow your weed?!

                        NORMAN
          Dude, if I tell you, I have to
          kill you.

Norman takes a hit on his reefer.

                        MIKE
          They're going to kill us, you
          stoner!

Norman sees the army of spiders closing in.

                        NORMAN
          Over here!

                                              (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Norman opens    an access door. Sam and the other survivors
run over and    crowd through it. Norman shuts the door
behind them.     The groups of pursuing spiders collide and
begin ripping    each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy.


INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway.

                           WADE
             Where are you taking us?

                              NORMAN
             To Shangri-la.


INT. MALL - BASEMENT POT ROOM - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of
pot paraphernalia. Hookahs. Weed growing in hydroponic
units under battery powered lights. Psychedelic posters.

                           NORMAN
             You aren't going to arrest me for
             this are you?

                              SAM
             Not today.

The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door.

                           WADE
                    (to Norman)
             Oh great! Now you've trapped us!

Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs.

                           CHRIS
             We should be able to hold them off
             for a little while.

Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them.

                           ASHLEY
             They're coming through the wall!

The group tightens up. Back to back. Ready for the end.
Suddenly a human hand punches through the wall.

                              CHRIS
             What the hell?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

Bret Hale rips through the drywall. Filthy but alive.
Standing in a horizontal mine shaft. He sees Sam's gun
pointed right at him.

                           BRET
             I didn't touch her!     I swear!

Sam looks at Ashley.

                           ASHLEY
             Don't waste your bullets.

Wade embraces his son.

                           WADE
             I thought you were a goner, boy!

Chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine.

                           CHRIS
             We can get out this way!

                           ASHLEY
             Aren't the spiders in there?

                           MIKE
             Not until daylight.

The BANGING on the upper door gets more INTENSE.

Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered
grow lights from his weed farm. He passes them out to
the group.

Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the
mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.
The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.

                           BRET
             You're going back in there?!       Are
             you all crazy!?

                              WADE
             Come on, Bret!

                            BRET
             No way!   I'm not going!

Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the
opening.

                                                     81.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Bret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at
the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS
DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.

                           CHRIS
          Cover me!

                        SAM
          What are you going to do?!

Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper
support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam
FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.

                           SAM
          Hurry!

Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking
spiders.

Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an
awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...

                        SAM
          Hold that thought.

They manage to disengage and move on.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors.

                        WADE
          We're trapped again!

                        CHRIS
          At least they can't follow us.

                        SAM
          Which way do we go?

                        CHRIS
          I think we're in one of the old
          tunnels.

                        SAM
          Can you get us out of here?

                        CHRIS
          Don't worry, Sam.

Chris takes point with the others following nervously.

                                                       82.

INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT

A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file
into a slightly more open area with two branching
tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
barrels of toxic waste.

                        CHRIS
          I don't believe it...

Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch.

                        MIKE
          I've seen one of these before!

                           ASHLEY
          What are they?

                           CHRIS
          Toxic waste.

                        SAM
          Where did you see it, Mike?

                        MIKE
          The creek where Joshua gets his
          spider food. There was one in the
          water.

Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.

                        CHRIS
          We can get out this way!

                        BRET
          No, we can't.
                 (turns to Wade)
          Isn't that tunnel blocked off,
          Dad?

Chris and the others look at Wade.

                        WADE
          Uh... yeah... he's right.   We
          can't get out that way.

                           CHRIS
          You did this?

                        WADE
          I knew you'd never sell... We're
          under my property so...

                           SAM
             You put all of us at risk.

                           WADE
             I didn't have a choice! I was
             broke! They gave me a hundred
             grand!

Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground.

                           SAM
             I think our lives are worth a
             little more than that.

                           CHRIS
             We're wasting time.

Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after
them.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs
runs along the roof into both tunnels.

                           CHRIS
             One end of these lights should be
             connected to a generator. That'll
             be near the entrance.

They continue down the tunnel.     Entering...


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.

                           WADE
             My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't
             lying! That's what I can put on
             the insurance form... giant
             spiders!

                           ASHLEY
             Ewww... what's that smell?

The others are reacting strongly.

             Methane.   This cavern is full of
             gas.

                           ASHLEY
             What does that mean?

                           CHRIS
             One spark and we're all dead.

Norman swallows his glowing joint.

Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.

                           MIKE
             That's what I was talking about,
             Chris. Presents from the male
             tarantula to the female.

                           BRET
             So the female's around here?

Bret looks around nervously.

The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh
balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.
He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
drained away.

Mike hides his eyes.     Ashley comforts him.

                           SAM
             That one just moved!

Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.       The
web comes away to reveal a human hand.

                           CHRIS
             There's somebody in here!

Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
They finally reveal Gladys.

                            CHRIS
             Gladys!

The woman's body begins to spasm.

                           CHRIS
             Gladys, please...
                    (to the others)
             Can anybody help her?!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                               85.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.

                           ASHLEY
             Her breathing is shallow.       She's
             going into arrest.

Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.

                             CHRIS
             It's okay.    It's okay.

Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.

                             GLADYS
             Am I... dead?

                             CHRIS
             You're okay.

                           GLADYS
             I'm not in heaven?

                             CHRIS
             No...

                           GLADYS
             Then what's with all the gold?

Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the
cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The
reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the
cavern walls.

                             WADE
             Gold! Gold!     Look!    It's
             everywhere!

                             SAM
             Is it real?

Chris checks it out.

                           CHRIS
             Jesus... it's the mother lode...
             He was right. My dad was right...

Chris helps Gladys to her feet.         They share an emotional
look of recognition.

                             GLADYS
             So were you.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          86.

Wade chips away at the gold.

                           WADE
             Get as much as you can!

Bret looks at Ashley.

                           BRET
             Nice work, Doc.

Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.           Sam
puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder.

                           SAM
             You saved my life.

Ashley smiles.

Gladys leans over to Norman.

                           GLADYS
             Have you got a smoke, kid?

                           NORMAN
             The man says this cavern is full
             of highly flammable methane gas.
             I smoke to get high, not to die.

                           SAM
             Spiders!

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows.

                           NORMAN
             What's the big deal?

Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.
Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the
squashed bodies.

                           MIKE
             I think you should stop.

                           NORMAN
             Why?

                        MIKE
          They don't have hair. They aren't
          fully grown tarantulas.

Chris and Sam look over.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        87.

CONTINUED:

                           MIKE
             They're giant babies!

Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.

Chris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming...

The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far
the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.
Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.

Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.

                           MIKE
             Consuela.

                           CHRIS
             Consuela?

The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is
something weird there. A lot of weird things. In
fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas.

As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain
spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.

                           NORMAN
             Bummer...

Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.

                           CHRIS
             Go!

The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A
male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam
BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away
bits of gold.

                           CHRIS
             Leave it!

                           WADE
             So you can keep it all!?   Hell no!

Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a
nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
behind him.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          88.

CONTINUED:

                              BRET
             Dad!

Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for
him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's
chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave.

                              CHRIS
             Bret, come on!

Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret
leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.

                              ASHLEY
             Bret!

Ashley goes to his side.

                              BRET
             I'm sorry I...

Bret dies.     Sam drags Ashley away from him.


INT. MINES - NIGHT

The survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling.

                           SAM
             We have to get out!

                           CHRIS
             This is our chance to kill them
             all.

Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.

                           CHRIS
             When the power comes on, the bulb
             will ignite the methane and torch
             them!

                           SAM
             Where did you get an idea like
             that!?

Chris looks at Gladys.

                           GLADYS
             I blew up the kitchen.

             Keep going up the tunnel. There
             should be a generator at the exit.
             Start it up and await for my
             signal to throw the switch.

                           SAM
             And the toxic waste...

                           CHRIS
             Will be buried under tons of rock!
             Go!

                           SAM
             What about you?

                           CHRIS
             I need to set the fuse as close to
             the spiders as I can. That should
             give us time to get clear.

Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls
down the lights, dragging them back toward the
tarantula's den.

                           SAM
             He has a cute butt.    Don't you
             think?

                           GLADYS
             U.S.D.A. choice.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris comes through with his light bulb fuse. Consuela
and her babies are feasting on the bodies of Bret and
Wade Hale.

Chris finds a vent in the ground.       He sprinkles dust over
it to identify a faint draft.

                           CHRIS
             Bingo.

He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas
jet.


INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Mike helps Gladys up the tunnel. Sam and Ashley are
behind. Suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the
shadows, separating the groups.

                                                (CONTINUED)

             Keep going!

Sam and Ashley flee down another tunnel.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris finishes preparing the booby trap. He gets up to
leave. Only to find Consuela coming toward him.

                           CHRIS
             I hate spiders.

Chris runs out of the cavern.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running.


INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula. Sam stumbles
over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost
motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula
coming after them.

                           ASHLEY
             Hurry!

Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She
STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam
accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The
bike's headlight illuminates their path.

The male tarantula scurries after the bike.

Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
on tight. They've put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.

Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward
the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite
direction.

                           ASHLEY
             Oh shit.

Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.

                             SAM
             Banzai!

With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard
onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is
roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel.


EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the
tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It
won't catch.

                             MIKE
             It needs gas!

                           GLADYS
             There's a ranch!

Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him,
Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs.


EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the
motorcycle.

                             MIKE
             It needs gas!

Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of
the tank. It's clear this is not going to work.

                             ASHLEY
             Hurry!


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs.     Smashing light bulbs.   Consuela close

          Hurry, Mom!

Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator.   She tries
to start it. It won't turn over.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.   He keeps
going.


INT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - DAWN

Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to
start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate.

                        CHRIS
          Throw the switch!

                        SAM
          I don't have any power!

                          ASHLEY
          Yo, Mom!

Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches
it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING
it.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially,
traveling past him into the cavern.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the
gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout
the mines.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN

A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the
gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like
popcorn.

                                                           93.

EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her. Consuela
is on his heels. The glow of a fireball is right behind
them.

                          SAM
          Come on!

Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames.

                          SAM
          Chris!

Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration.


EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening. A pillar of
flame shoots out behind them.   Ashley and Mike are
nearby. The town is visible just a mile away.


EXT. TOWN - DAY

The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into
the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.


INT. VARIOUS MINE TUNNELS - DAY

The chain reaction spreads through the mines.      Jets of
flame blast up tunnels.

Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home.
Rupturing the very earth around them.


EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.

                          ASHLEY
          Earthquake!

                        CHRIS
          No! It's a chain reaction! The
          whole valley is going to blow!

                        MIKE
          We'll never get out in time!

Gladys drives up in     Wade's humvee.   Cigar in mouth.

             Let's get the fuck out of here!

The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to
BLOW UP in the distance.

Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!
The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for
revenge.

Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her.            He
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
Consuela's fangs.

Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at
him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela
begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.
He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually
helping it!

Mike and the others watch from the humvee.

                           MIKE
             Oh no... she's molting!

Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated!

Consuela comes after Chris.        He defends himself with the
machete.

Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.
Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares
the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.

                               MIKE
             Consuela!   No!     Bad!   Bad
             Consuela!

The massive spider stops in shock.            Chris looks back to
see Mike has returned.


TARANTULA POV

The familiar multi-perspective spider vision.            The
tarantula seems to recognize Mike.

                                                       95.

BACK TO MIKE

He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...

Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected
abdomen...

The tarantula screams.

Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike.   They dive
into the back of the humvee.

Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She
collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.
The earth itself begins to collapse.


INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY

Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.
BUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall
is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth. The
humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling
desert.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The humvee reaches open road. The survivors watch out
the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive
sinkhole.


EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

The group sits in a long beat of abject shock. And then
Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped.

                        CHRIS
          I really need some pants that fit.

The group smiles.    Happy to be alive.

                          MIKE
          Look out!

Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves
to avoid it.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward
safety.

The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is
grabbed by a large trap-door spider.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK, SCENIC VIEW LOT - MORNING

     Shenandoah mountains. A cold dawn. TWO BLACK TOWN CARS
     sit side by side, facing a view of a farming valley below.

     Two MEN in dark suits and long coats stand near the
     cars, casually on the lookout. If we caught a glimpse
     underneath the coat of the taller of the two, we'd see
     that he was carrying a 9mm. Glock.

     INT. BLACK TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

     In the backseat of the car sit HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS,
     each well-kept and in his early 50's.

                        REYNOLDS
            "I know thy works and thy labour
            and how thou canst not bear them
            that are evil. And thou hast tried
            them who say they are apostles and
            hast found them to be liars".
            Revelations II.

                        HAMERSLEY
            What the hell does it mean?

                        REYNOLDS
            It means who's side are you on?

                        HAMERSLEY
            You didn't ask me to meet you 30
            miles from my office for a Bible
            study class.

                        REYNOLDS
            It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone
            needs to swallow hard. No one,
            including you, wants to be fingered
            as the one obstructing efforts to
            crack down on terrorism, and--

                        HAMERSLEY
            Fuck you.

                        REYNOLDS
            What?

                        HAMERSLEY
            I said fuck you.

                        REYNOLDS
            Is that anyway to talk to an old
            school chum?

                        HAMERSLEY
            You're gonna finger me as soft on
            terrorism? Terrorism, you
            unconscionable asshole?

                        REYNOLDS
            There are planes falling out of the
            sky, buildings blowing up. American
            buildings. Americans getting bombs
            in the mail. What are we gonna do!?

                        HAMERSLEY
            We're not gonna hand you and your
            band of lunatics the keys to the
            kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in
            Congress and write a law that
            allows the NSA to point a camera
            and a microphone at anything they
            damn well feel like. And the next
            time you have something to say to
            me, we do it above-board, in my
            office, like everyone else. Now get
            outa my car, I've got a committee
            meeting on the hill.

     REYNOLDS regards HAMERSLEY a moment, then opens the car
     door--

     EXT. PARKWAY - MORNING

     HAMERSLEY's car snakes down the twisting mountain road.

     INT. HAMERSLEY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

     HAMERSLEY MAKES VERBAL NOTES concerning the Reynolds
     meeting into his memo-recorder as he drives. He picks
     up his cellular phone and punches in a number.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Senator Albert's office--

     The line goes dead.

     HAMERSLEY tries again but can't get a dial tone. Then,
     in the rear-view mirror, a BROWN SEDAN gains fast.
     Whoever the guy is, he's flying. Then a man with a
     rifle leans out the sedan's window. Aims.

     HAMERSLEY flies into a blind curve. Tires SCREECH as he
     rounds the bend to see

     A PROPANE TRUCK. Blocking both lanes of the road.

     HAMERSLEY's eyes widen. He stomps the brakes, SKIDS and
     SLAMS into the truck. The EXPLOSION engulfs everything.
     HAMERSLEY and the car are consumed. The pursuing sedan
     slows to a stop. The men watch. The car's an inferno.

     The MEN pull a 'U' and drive away.

     INT. CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA, TALL OFFICE BLDG. - DAY

     A well-appointed big-city law office filled with
     citations of merit and pictures of a wife and child.

     ROBERT DEAN, a likable young lawyer, sits behind his
     desk with his back to an OLDER MAN. He stares at a
     commanding view of Washington, D.C. as he listens to a
     tired, smoke and whiskey voice.

                        OLDER MAN (L.T.)
            I don't know how much longer we can
            hold out, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            I don't know, either, L.T. Maybe
            you guys should get yourself a
            labor lawyer.

                        L.T.
            Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean.
            'Cause you're a labor lawyer.

                        DEAN
            Good point.

                        L.T.
            Last night, Larry Spinks, he works
            the Steel Press, he goes to a bar
            with his wife Rosalie to have a
            glass of chianti 'cause it's his
            birthday, and these two guys, these
            Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him
            when he goes to the bathroom.

                        DEAN
            L.T., in this office I'd prefer you
            say Italian-Americans.

                        L.T.
            I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in
            St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm
            not myself. The Union bosses say
            unless we take Bellmoth's offer,
            it'll only get worse.

                        DEAN
            That's because your Union bosses
            are those Guido mother-fuckers.

                        L.T.
            I don't under--

                        DEAN
            The Union's trying to railroad you
            into accepting terms worse than
            what you have now.

                        L.T.
            Why would the Union--

     DEAN swivels around in his chair and faces L.T.

                        DEAN
            Because they've been paid off by
            Bellmoth.

                        L.T.
            Mr. Dean--

                        DEAN
            My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer.
            Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.

     DEAN gets up and walks a grateful L.T. to the door,
     calling to his secretary as they go--

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
               (calling)
            Martha!

     MARTHA appears in the doorway...

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            Larry Spinks, St. Lukes. Send him a
            case of chianti from the firm. And
            send his wife Rosalie some flowers.

     EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

                        RACHEL
            How's the trout?

                        DEAN
            It tastes like fish.

                        RACHEL
            It is fish.

                        DEAN
            I mean it tastes like every other
            fish I've ever had. Every fish
            tastes the same.

                        RACHEL
            Do you like fish?

                        DEAN
            Not that much.

     DEAN dines in a booth with RACHEL BANKS, 30's. RACHEL
     opens her briefcase, removing an 8x10 envelope.

                        RACHEL
            Here's what you asked for. Brill's
            note said it was everything you'd
            need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--

                        DEAN
            When do I get to meet him?

                        RACHEL
            DePinto?

                        DEAN
            Brill.

                        RACHEL
            Never.

                        DEAN
            That wasn't the answer I was hoping
            for.

                        RACHEL
            What answer were you--

     DEAN is reaching inside his jacket pocket. He removes
     an envelope marked "BRILL".

                        DEAN
            "Soon". Or at least sooner than never.

                        RACHEL
            It's how he works.

                        DEAN
            Brill?

                        RACHEL
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            So you've said.

     DEAN hands her the envelope.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            Ten thousand cash. I don't know if
            it's Brill's prices going up or
            your commission.

                        RACHEL
            I take a straight 15 percent.
            Brill's fee varies with risk.
            Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
            using someone else.

                        DEAN
            Other than Brill.

                        RACHEL
            Other than me.

                        DEAN
            Why would I--

                        RACHEL
            Someone with whom you don't have
            quite so personal a--

                        DEAN
            I like our history. And I like you.
            I'd probably like Brill if I ever
            got to--

                        RACHEL
            He doesn't work that way.

                        DEAN
            I just want to make sure I'm not
            breaking the law.

                        RACHEL
            You're not.

                        DEAN
            How can I be sure.

                        RACHEL
            I wouldn't let you. Good luck with
            DePinto.

                        DEAN
               (pause)
            Thank you.

                        RACHEL
            Eat your fish.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean.
            I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.

     EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

     DEAN weaves his BMW through D.C. bumper-to-bumper
     traffic as he eyes the photos that Rachel gave him
     which are lying on the passenger seat. The photos show
     DePINTO sitting in a motel lounge with TWO MOB TYPES.
     He's talking on the phone.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. BELLMOTH STEEL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                        DEPINTO
            What can I do for you?

                        DEAN
            Well, I was hoping you might stop
            by my office to swear out a
            criminal deposition against some of
            your friends and co-workers.

                        DEPINTO
               (pause)
            Is this a fuckin' joke?

                        DEAN
            I don't believe it is, no.

                        DEPINTO
            Why the hell would I--

                        DEAN
            I've got photographs of you at the
            Trenton Ramada looking very--

                        DEPINTO
            That ain't me.

                        DEAN
            It's not?

                        DEPINTO
            You don't know who the fuck--

                        DEAN
            That's not you having a whiskey
            sour with Carmine Morada.

                        DEPINTO
            This is fucked. You don't know
            who's in that--

                        DEAN
            You're right, Mr. DePinto, and
            maybe I jumped the gun.

                        DEPINTO
            You're goddam right you jumped the gun.

                        DEAN
            That's probably not you in the
            picture. I tell you what, I'll just
            run the thing by the Grand Jury,
            see if they can't--

                        DEPINTO
            I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.

                        DEAN
            Good news there, Mr. DePinto,
            you're talking to one.

     EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

     News helicopters hover over Hamersley's wreck as police
     direct traffic around the media circus.

     INT. OLD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     DAN ZAVITZ, looks older than he is, balding with a
     weight problem, sweats behind SLAPPING wipers of a
     beater car plastered with environmental issue stickers.
     NPR drones on the radio as a police car crawls behind
     him, SIREN YELPING, lights flashing, trying to get by.

                        ZAVITZ
            Alright, alright already, I see you.

     ZAVITZ POV: Wreckage surrounded by squad cars,
     ambulances and media circus. Something's happened.
     Something big.

     EXT. SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK - DAY

     A tall ladder leans against a dead oak. ZAVITZ sweats
     and climbs to a branch where a platform's been built
     supporting a large phony bird's nest. He lifts away the
     nest, revealing--

     --Two microphones and three motion-activated digital
     video cameras and recorders. ZAVITZ checks the cameras'
     viewfinders to see--

     --TIME-CODED VIEWS - WIDE, MEDIUM AND CLOSE of a
     squirrel's nest containing three newborns. The parents
     are nowhere to be seen.

     ZAVITZ eyes the recorders. The video disks are spent.
     He ejects and pockets them, replacing them with fresh ones.

     EXT. SOUTHEAST CAPITOL DISTRICT - DAY

     An old building needing rehab. A SIDEWALK VENDOR does
     brisk business, we DRIFT to an apartment window above.

                        TV NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
            Police are labeling it an accident
            but promise a full investigation.

     INT. ZAVITZ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     ZAVITZ is staring intently at his computer monitor. We
     don't know yet what he's looking at, but he's scared to
     death as we continue to listen to the NEWS REPORT...

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
            Don Hamersley, senior GOP
            congressional leader, was serving
            as a negotiator on the House/Senate
            sub-committee studying the Anti-
            Terror Bill...

     ZAVITZ leans in a little closer to get a better look at
     his computer screen, not wanting to believe what he's
     seeing...

                        NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) (O.S.)
            ...the controversial legislation
            that would give various law
            enforcement agencies expanded
            authority in the fight against

     And now we see what ZAVITZ is staring at on his
     computer monitor. The film he shot at SHENANDOAH PARK...

     ...the meeting between HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS.

            Known as the Voice of Caution,
            Hamersley was an outspoken advocate
            of...

     ZAVITZ reaches over, picks up the phone, and punches in
     some numbers with one hand. With the other, he punches
     some keystrokes on the computer. The screen zooms in on
     REYNOLDS, getting out of HAMERSLEY's car.

                        NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) (O.S.)
            Sixty-eight years old, Hamersley
            leaves behind a wife and four children.

                        ZAVITZ
               (into phone)
            Tell him it's Zavitz. I need to
            speak to him. Tell him it's important.

     INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - SAME TIME

     A cluttered office belonging to a radical, fringe
     newspaper. ALFONSO, mid-50's, long, graying hair, works
     at a computer.

                        ALFONSO
            Zavitz, what? You want your old job
            back?

                        ZAVITZ
            Listen to me--

            Tired of chasing squirrels around
            the park?

                        ZAVITZ
            Listen--

                        ALFONSO
            Lemme ask you something. I put a
            bird feeder out in the yard, but
            the squirrels, they keep taking--

                        ZAVITZ
            Turn on CNN.

                        ALFONSO
            They keep taking the bird seed. I
            thought since you're the expert on--

                        ZAVITZ
            Goddammit, shut the fuck up and
            turn on CNN!

                        ALFONSO
            Alright, I made a joke about
            squirrels, don't get so--

                        ZAVITZ
            Do it!

     ALFONSO clicks his TV to CNN. The HAMERSLEY re-cap is
     still on.

            Once again, police at this point
            are calling Hamersley's death an
            accident...

                        ZAVITZ
            I was doing motion-activated taping
            up in Shenandoah. That's where
            Hamersley had his accident. He
            wasn't alone. He met someone. They
            argued.

                        ALFONSO
            You've got it on tape?

                        ZAVITZ
            Clear as day.

     There's a KNOCK at the door...

            The door was open, sir. I just need
            a signature.

     ZAVITZ disconnects a video digitizer, removes a game-
     cartridge containing the digitized video...

     ...and inserts it into a Gameboy.

     He steps to the door and eyes the peep-hole.

     ZAVITZ POV: A fish-eye view of a Fed-Ex man, JONES,
     looking bored.

                        ZAVITZ
            Can you tell me who it's from?

                        JONES
               (checking label)
            Micro-Tel Electronics. Sunland.

                        ZAVITZ
            Can you--would it be possible to
            leave it by the door?

                        JONES
            Not without a signature.

                        ZAVITZ
               (stepping to the window)
            All right. Okay. Just give me a minute.

     ZAVITZ POV: TWO DWP INSTALLERS hovering in a bucket
     across the street. Down below, a cargo van with a
     multiple roof antenna is double parked near a Fed-Ex
     van. Then--

     --Through a street window's reflection, ZAVITZ sees his
     building's front entrance. SEVERAL TENANTS are being
     prevented from entering by TWO MEN, plain clothes, one
     with a radio communicator pressed to his ear.

     Shit.

     ZAVITZ backs from the window, seized by panic. He grabs
     his phone...

     ...dead.

     He picks up his fax line. Also dead.

     He grabs the GameBoy, goes to a small side window and
     opens it. A ledge snakes around the corner. An athlete
     he's not but there's no choice. He squeezes out.

            is out the window.

     PRATT sprints down the hall, pulling out his pistol, as

     JONES kicks in Zavitz's door and rushes in. The
     window's open. JONES looks out as the last of ZAVITZ
     goes around the corner of the ledge.

                        RADIO VOICE (O.S.)

     EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

     It's the rooftop ZAVITZ is heading to. Two MEN crouch
     behind a wall, watching ZAVITZ approach.

               (into headset)
            We'll take delivery from here.

     ZAVITZ inches along, scared breathless. He looks back.

     No one.

     Maybe he was wrong.

     A pigeon suddenly flies by...ZAVITZ loses his balance,
     struggles...and falls.

     He crashes through an awning and into a sidewalk fruit
     stand.

     Dazed, ZAVITZ crawls to his feet as passersby watch
     speechless.

     Things happen fast. The cargo van rips from the curb
     but is suddenly blocked by a delivery truck. HORNS BLAST.

     HICKS, 30's and athletic, leaps from the van.

     Fears confirmed, ZAVITZ starts down the sidewalk,
     shakes off pain, and moves to a run.

     Except now there's someone in front of him. He's
     trapped. Reaching a doorway, ZAVITZ pushes. The door
     opens to--

     A garbage truck screams up the alley. There's no way to
     outrun it. There's a fire escape above a dumpster.
     Breath rasping, he struggles on the dumpster, pulling
     himself up the ladder just as the truck OBLITERATES all
     below.

     ZAVITZ struggles and climbs. Reaching a landing, he
     pauses for breath...

     ...and sees HICKS and two others just moments behind.
     ZAVITZ grabs a fire escape door, tugs, pulls and bangs
     it open to--

     INT. A DILAPIDATED HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     ZAVITZ hurtles by, trips, get up, runs again, adrenaline

     He flies past the diners and exits into--

     HICKS and ANOTHER fly out of the diner, just in time to
     see ZAVITZ melting in with Christmas shoppers that are
     entering a department store.

     We see that the large sign over the entrance to the
     store reads: "HARRISON'S".

     INT. HARRISON'S DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

     An upscale store packed with Christmas shoppers.

     At a fashion ramp, a small crowd of mostly WOMEN have
     gathered to watch leggy models feature a particular
     line of lingerie. Mixed in among this group is DEAN, a
     shopping bag in each hand, his briefcase tucked under
     one arm, trying his best to affect an air of the
     studious shopper.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            May I help you?

                        DEAN

            Hm?!

     The WOMAN is sales clerk who's been in this situation
     before.

                        SALES CLERK
            Do you see anything you like?

                        DEAN
            I'm married.

                        SALES CLERK
            That's fine.

                        DEAN
            I'm married to my wife...of several
            years...and I'd like to buy...as a
            Christmas present...

                        SALES CLERK
            You'd like to buy your wife some
            lingerie as a Christmas gift.

                        DEAN
            Yes. I have her permission.

                        SALES CLERK
            It's okay. I think it's a wonderful
            gift.

                        DEAN
            Can you help me?

                        SALES CLERK
            How 'bout Christian Dior?

                        DEAN
            Is that good?

                        SALES CLERK
            Very good.

                        DEAN
            I don't know anything about this.
            Well, I mean, I know a little
            about--from a certain perspective.
            My point is, I don't want to do
            anything foolish.

                        SALES CLERK
            It's a little late for that.

                        DEAN
            I'll say.

                        SALES CLERK
            What size?

                        DEAN
            Pardon?

                        SALES CLERK
            What size?

                        DEAN
            Eight.  Size eight.

                        SALES CLERK
            I'll be right back.

                        DEAN
            Thanks.

                        SALES CLERK
            Remain calm.

                        DEAN
            Okay.

     The SALES CLERK goes around the counter to the rear
     area. DEAN glances at the fashion show when he glimpses--

     ZAVITZ, hurrying through the women's dressing area,
     desperately looking for an exit. No luck. ZAVITZ moves
     toward DEAN, about to break for the front, but HICKS is
     there searching. Trapped, ZAVITZ ducks behind a display.

     DEAN watches, unaware of ZAVITZ's pursuers. Then it
     clicks...

                        DEAN
            Daniel?

     ZAVITZ turns, frightened....

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            It's me, Robert Dean.

            Yeah.

                        DEAN
            I'm just doing some Christmas
            shopping. It's for my wife, no
            kidding. Though, this isn't the
            main present, it's just, you know,
            a little--

                        ZAVITZ
            I need help.

                        DEAN
            Tell me about it.

                        ZAVITZ
            How can I reach you?

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Are you okay?

                        ZAVITZ

            Yeah, what's going on?

                        SALES CLERK (O.S.)
            I think she'll like this very much.

                        DEAN
            Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.

                        SALES CLERK
            For that matter, I think you will too.

                        DEAN
               (to the SALES CLERK)
            Could you give me just a moment to
            talk to a friend of mine here? Not
            about this, but...Daniel?

     DEAN looks around...

     ...ZAVITZ is gone.

     EXT. HARRISON'S DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

     Out on the street, ZAVITZ shoves into a group of
     shoppers waiting for the light. Then he sees HICKS and
     his PARTNER. They see him.

     Fuck the light.

     ZAVITZ runs into the street as--

     --a BUS speeds through yellow. ZAVITZ is caught in its
     path.

     BAM!

     Only stunned witnesses remain.

     DEAN exits the department store. He sees the commotion
     and makes his way over.

                        DEAN
               (to a bystander)
            What happened?

                        BYSTANDER
            A guy got hit by a bus.

                        DEAN
            Ah, Jesus.

     SIRENS can be heard in the distance. DEAN eyes the
     ground where the body lays. He sees Zavitz's BLOODY
     JACKET...

                        DEAN
               (quietly)
            Ah...Jesus.

     DEAN's BMW drives through a neighborhood of stately

     INT. DEAN'S BMW - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN drives, a little shaken by events. The RADIO plays
     an AT&T COMMERCIAL relaying the joys of home tele-
     conferencing. DEAN enters the driveway of his picture-
     perfect home.

     INT. DEAN'S HOME/FOYER - NIGHT

     DEAN enters with his shopping bags and briefcase.
     Searching for family members, he enters--

     INT. DEAN'S HOME/DEN - NIGHT

     DEAN's 8 year old son, ERIC and Eric's friend DYLAN sit
     by the big-screen TV, glued to a video game. A NANNY is
     nearby, lost in a magazine.

                        DEAN
            Excuse me, have any of you seen an
            eight year old boy, good looking,
            about yea-big.

                        ERIC
            Hi, dad.

                        DYLAN
            Hi, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            Hello. Hello, Maria.

                        NANNY (MARIA)
            Hello, Mr. Dean.

                        ERIC
            We can't get to the fourth level.
            We keep getting vaporized by the
            Black Knight.

                        DEAN
            You're learning a cruel lesson.

                        ERIC
            Are those my Christmas presents?

                        DEAN
            Some of 'em.

                        ERIC
            Can I open 'em up?

                        DEAN
            Sure, go ahead.

                        ERIC
            Really?

                        DEAN
            In your dreams.

                        ERIC
            Dad!

                        DEAN
               (to DYLAN)
            You staying for dinner?

                        DYLAN
            Is it okay?

                        DEAN
            You got any money?

                        ERIC
            He's kidding.

                        DEAN
            Where's mom?

                        ERIC
            She's in the kitchen.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     The kitchen is in the midst of a remodel. A wall-
     mounted TV is showing "CROSSFIRE", where the two HOSTS
     are mediating a battle between TWO SENATORS.

     STACY watches the show with one eye, cooks with the other.

                        SENATOR TASKEN (TV)
            Laws service society and they need
            to be flexible to meet changing
            demands. We've got to be able to
            deal with a terrorist threat before
            it occurs.

     DEAN enters...

                        DEAN
            Hey.

                        STACY
            This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.

                        DEAN
            Uh-oh.

                        STACY
            Listen to him.

                        SENATOR TASKEN (TV)
            This is no longer a theoretical
            problem, it's a reality. Turn on
            the news. Bombings, hostages--

                        DEAN
            He's got a point.

                        STACY
            Bobby!

                        DEAN
            Not a very good one, but--

                        STACY
            So you tap everyone's phone? You
            use computers to probe financial
            records? New Search and Seizure laws?

                        DEAN
            Just for the criminals.

                        STACY
            We won't suspend the civil rights
            of the good people.

                        DEAN
            Right.

                        STACY
            You should take this seriously.

                        DEAN
            I think you're taking it seriously
            enough for both of us.

     He kisses her. A good one.

                        STACY
               (softer)
            You're a lawyer. Don't you care
            what's going on around you?

                        DEAN
            Something bad happened tonight.

                        STACY
            What?

                        DEAN
            I saw a man die.

                        STACY
            What do you mean?

                        DEAN
            In front of Harrison's, he got hit
            by a bus. I knew him. The firm did
            some pro bono work for his
            organization a few years back.

                        STACY
               (beat)
            I'm sorry.

                        DEAN
            The thing is, when I saw him, it
            seemed like he wanted to tell me...
               (beat)
            ...he was upset about something and
            he said...
               (beat)
            Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.

                        STACY
            What'd you buy at Harrison's?

                        DEAN
            A toaster. And no terrorist talk at
            dinner. You're spookin' the kids.

     DEAN heads upstairs...

     REYNOLDS cellular phone rings. He opens his briefcase
     and takes it out.

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 

     REYNOLDS busts out of the room, phone to his ear. Two

     SALES CLERK. Nearby, a monitor shows a time-coded
     surveillance tape of the lingerie section. DEAN and
     ZAVITZ are in playback, engaged in their earlier meeting.

     Finally, a confirming tone...

                        REYNOLDS
            What happened?

                        HICKS
            He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.

                        REYNOLDS
            What about the tapes?

                        HICKS
            We found the originals.

                        REYNOLDS
            The originals?

                        HICKS
            There was a transfer.

                        REYNOLDS
            Am I to understand--

                        HICKS
            He never made it to the newspaper,
            but there was private sector contact.

                        REYNOLDS
            Who?

                        HICKS
            Several indiscriminates and one

            the threat. Then cross-check

     A SKINNY MAN clutches the folder, walking by endless
     cubicles of high-tech industriousness. He stops where
     an ANALYST types on a terminal near a retinal scanner.
     The ANALYST opens the folder to see a request for a
     PRIORITY WRAP on ROBERT DEAN, followed by a Social
     Security Number. The ANALYST enters in the number.

     A MONTAGE OF IMAGES GAINING IN SPEED--

     are red-flagged.

     A matching ZAVITZ ITEM is found. DEAN's banking info is
     red-flagged. He has large cash withdrawals with no
     matching purchases. His withdrawal dates match up with
     unaccounted-for cash deposits...

     ...in RACHEL BANKS' savings account.

     More probes are recommended into the RACHEL BANKS/ROBERT

     CLOSE ON EYE BEING SCANNED - We HEAR a TONE.

     PULL BACK to a PREGNANT WOMAN sitting with her head
     pressed to the scanner. A second verification TONE
     sounds. A poster above her work station reads:

                        IN A DIGITAL WORLD

     She enters a phone number in her terminal. The computer
     DIALS. She waits, snacking on rice cakes. Finally,
     another computer ANSWERS. On screen appears: PAC-TEL
     TESTING BOARD. The screen fills with choices. She
     highlights -

     She enters another command. A new prompt reads: ENTER
     LINE REQUEST NUMBER.

     Eyeing DEAN's folder, she enters the phone number and
     commands "ENTER". "RECORD".

     The telephone tap is instant.

     A VOICE GRAPH appears in-sync with CONVERSATION now
     coming over the speakers.

            Diane's instinct is that it's sabre
            rattling. I think they're gonna
            file suit.

     She enters more commands. An Automated-Voice-Transcriber
     kicks in. DEAN's CONVERSATION is now transcribed

     Beneath a sign reading U.S. North-East Coastal Region,
     an ANALYST reviews time-coded, digital SAT videos of
     Washington, D.C. As seen from space, the Capitol
     appears to be nothing more than a greyish mass. The
     ANALYST keys commands into his system.

     CLOSE ON MONITOR - The overhead SAT view of Washington
     moves in closer, soon streets are discernible, then
     cars and buses - then an accident in an intersection
     with flashing ambulance lights and a bus. A body lies
     twisted in the street - it's ZAVITZ.

     The ANALYST enters additional commands. The ZAVITZ/bus
     accident freezes, then plays in reverse as if recorded
     by the eye of God.  The scene continues reversing,
     following close on Zavitz as he back-tracks into
     Harrison's Department Store.

            We've checked everything. NRO tapes,
            traffic surveillance monitors -

     INT. IMAGE ENHANCEMENT LAB

     TWO TECHIES huddle by a monitor overseen by FIEDLER, a

     surveillance tape of the ZAVITZ/DEAN meeting.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            - and two ATM cameras. The one
            showing promise, though, is this
            security camera from the department
            store.
               (to TECHIE)
            Freeze there.

     The TECHIE hits a command. ZAVITZ and DEAN freeze on
     screen.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Times ten.

     The TECHIE boxes the area to be enhanced. He types
     commands. The boxed area increases ten-fold.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Focus on the drop.

     The enlarged view shifts to DEAN's gift bags. The
     picture's fuzzy. Someone passes by, blocking the view
     at a crucial moment.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Enhance, then forward, frame by
            frame...

     More keystrokes. The computer takes over, clarifying
     the image with passes of resolution.

     HICKS leans in closer as the image of the bag inches
     forward.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Just before the view's blocked,
            Zavitz reaches in his jacket for
            something. When the view returns,
            there's a shape change in Dean's
            bag. See the shadow variance? We
            reverse imaged it--

     FIEDLER points to another screen displaying a digitally-
     enhanced image of the shadowed object and its
     approximate shape.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Something's definitely been added.
            It's not a video cassette, the
            shadow's wrong.

     REYNOLDS steps forward. His eyes are red. It's been a
     long night.

                        REYNOLDS
            What's your opinion?

                        FIEDLER
            It's hard to say for certain, these
            things are--

                        REYNOLDS
            I'm not asking you to say for certain.
            This is what you're trained to do,
            right?

                        FIEDLER
            Yes sir.

                        REYNOLDS
            Then what's your goddam opinion?

                        FIEDLER
               (beat)
            Zavitz had digital compression
            equipment. He could've downloaded
            into something. A disk, a chip,
            anything small enough to put in his
            pocket and run with. Whatever he
            put it in, he dropped it in that bag.

                        REYNOLDS
               (to HICKS)
            Get it.

     REYNOLDS heads for the door.

                        HICKS
            We'd have to--

                        REYNOLDS
            Get it.

     come from a Redskins game.

     They drive in silence for a moment before...

                        STACY
            Bobby?

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        STACY
            How'd you get the information on
            DePinto?

                        DEAN
            What do you mean?

                        STACY
            Who did you work with to get the--

                        DEAN
            A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.

                        STACY
            Yeah, but you said you've never met
            him. How did you--

                        DEAN
            Honey, I don't like to talk about
            this stuff in front of Eric.

                        STACY
            Have you been working with Rachel?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        STACY
               (beat)
            Sorry.

                        DEAN
            It's okay.

     The RANGE ROVER pulls into the driveway.

     INT. DEAN'S HOME/ENTRY FOYER - NIGHT

     The DEAN's enter the doorway. ERIC and STACY are first.
     They stop, faces shocked. DEAN hasn't noticed yet. His
     hand automatically goes to the alarm key pad.

     CLOSE ON THE PAD - The LED reads: ARMED. DEAN punches
     the code -

                        STACY
            Oh my God -

     DEAN turns.

     The house is ransacked. The ALARM suddenly BLARES,
     adding mayhem.

     CLOSE-UP ON THE CEILING VENT - The CAMERA PUSHES IN
     TIGHT revealing a concealed, fiber-optic video lens the
     size of a pin-head.

     EXT. DEAN'S STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Several cars and a florist van are parked on the quiet
     street.

     INT. FLORIST VAN - CONTINUOUS

     The van is really an electronic surveillance post
     jammed with the latest equipment. A TECHIE with
     headphones eyes a monitor.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR showing the PIN HOLE SURVEILLANCE
     VIEW of STACY walking through a disheveled room in a
     state of shock while DEAN pulls out his cellular phone
     and dials.

                        DEAN
               (through the TECHIE's headphones)
            This is Robert Dean at 3325 Sutton
            Place. I want to report a break-in.

     INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - MORNING

     A black ball slams against a wall. PULL BACK to DEAN,
     who's angry, frustrated and drenched in sweat. He's
     embroiled in a hard, fast game with his friend, JERRY.

                        DEAN
            They took the espresso machine. The
            espresso machine, Jerry! Which
            makes sense, you know, because the
            crooks probably wanted to make
            themselves a latte before fencing
            the stereo.

                        JERRY
            Did they take your clothes?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        JERRY
            You've got a bunch of Armani suits,
            they didn't take 'em?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        JERRY
            Usually they take clothes.

                        DEAN
            Why don't you give 'em a call.

                        JERRY
            What about jewelry?

                        DEAN
            They didn't take the jewelry. They
            took the computers. They took the
            big-screen TV, they took my blender.

                        JERRY
            The blender?

                        DEAN
            I love my blender.

                        JERRY
            They didn't take the silverware?

                        DEAN
            No, but they took my blender.

                        JERRY
            Sounds like they didn't want
            anything that wasn't electric?

                        DEAN
            What?

                        JERRY
            They only took electrical appliances.

                        DEAN
            Serve the ball.

     INT. DEAN'S OFFICE BUILDING/LOBBY - MORNING

     A busy lobby for a major complex. DEAN, freshly
     showered, steps from a door marked: TO PARKING LEVELS.

                        MALE VOICE (O.S.)
            Robert Dean?

     DEAN turns to see MORELOS, 40's, an obsessive man with
     a terminal smile.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Yes?

                        MORELOS
            I didn't want to bother you during
            your racquetball game.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Thanks.
               (beat)
            Who are you?

     MORELOS shows him his badge.

                        MORELOS
            I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.

                        DEAN
            Hey, did you guys find my stuff?

                        MORELOS
            Your stuff?

                        DEAN
            The robbery.

                        MORELOS
            No, sir, I'm not involved with that.
            I'm doing a quick follow-up on a
            bus accident took place a few
            nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.

                        DEAN
            Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.

                        MORELOS
            Witnesses said you were there, but
            I notice you didn't file a report.

                        DEAN
            A report?

                        MORELOS
            A police report.

                        DEAN
            That's 'cause I wasn't there.

                        MORELOS
            You weren't at Harrison's Department
            Store the night before--

                        DEAN
            I was in the store, the accident
            was outside. It was a bus.

                        MORELOS
            Someone said you spoke to Mr.
            Zavitz before he died. I thought
            you might know something.

                        DEAN
            About what?

                        MORELOS
            About the accident.

                        DEAN
            I'm no expert, but I'm assuming
            that the impact of a moving bus
            against his body caused--

                        MORELOS
            Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.

                        DEAN
            What kind of trouble.

                        MORELOS
            You tell me.

                        DEAN
            I can't.

                        MORELOS
            Are you invoking attorney/client
            privilege.

                        DEAN
            I'm not his attorney.

                        MORELOS
            Than why can't you tell me.

                        DEAN
            Because I don't know.

                        MORELOS
            I'm just trying to determine if Mr.
            Zavitz was involved in something
            more than a simple bus accident.

                        DEAN
            Than why don't you talk to the bus
            driver?

                        MORELOS
            Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?

                        DEAN
            Somebody took my blender.

                        MORELOS
            We'd appreciate your cooperation.

                        DEAN
            I'm happy to help you all I can.
            But I didn't see the accident and I
            barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've
            gotta go to work.

     DEAN starts walking--MORELOS follows him.

                        MORELOS
            Did he give you anything?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        MORELOS
            Anything at all?

                        DEAN
            No, sir.

                        MORELOS
            Was he with anyone?

                        DEAN
            Not that I could see.

                        MORELOS
            Nobody gave you anything?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        MORELOS
            Why'd you go to Harrison's?

                        DEAN
            To buy lingerie.

                        MORELOS
            For your wife?

                        DEAN
            Yes, for my wife, what the hell
            kinds of questions are these.

                        MORELOS
            I thought maybe it might be for
            Rachel Banks.

     DEAN stops short and turns to MORELOS. He stares.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what's goin' on with
            Zavitz, but that was way, way outa
            line.
               (beat)
            You understand?

                        MORELOS
            Yes sir.

     DEAN steps into the elevator.

                        MORELOS
               (into concealed sleeve-mic)
            403 to 401. He's coming up.

     INT. LAW FIRM/CORRIDOR - DAY

     DEAN walks down the hall toward his office. He stops by
     PEERS as he enters his office.

                        PEERS
            'Morning, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            Hey. Would you get me what I need
            for Zwernickii and the Bellmoth
            motions.

                        PEERS
            Sure.

                        DEAN
            And do me a favor. Find out what
            you can about Daniel Zavitz. We did
            some work for him a few years back
            and there should be a file.

     DEAN enters his office and turns his computer on. It
     BEEPS, BOOTS and loads.

     INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     LEVIN approaches the men's room. A MAINTENANCE MAN
     cleans up broken glass and water by the door. A sign
     reads: CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE. Levin turns and leaves.

                        MAINTENANCE MAN
               (into concealed sleeve mic)
            402 to 401. Doorstep's clear.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Two more MAINTENANCE MEN kneel in a stall adjusting a
     portable monitor and oscillator. They aim a directional
     antenna using slow, sweeping motions.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR displaying the intercepted signal.
     It's Dean's computer screen with text being typed in.
     The words are hard to read due to horizontal drift.
     After adjusting the antenna, the signal smooths.

     We PUSH CLOSER. The signal shows the current display of
     Dean's computer screen. We see Dean's O.S. command pull
     up his E-Mail. A prompt asks for a password.

     XXXXXXX appears.

     A switch is flipped. XXXXXXX becomes PUCCINI. Dean's
     "secure" file opens. Entries appear.

                        MAN #1
            402, this is 401. Password's "Puccini."

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Establishing. A large, busy place. LAWYERS and AIDES
     bustle in and out of this structure.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     A busy morning as ATTORNEYS wait their turn to present
     motions before the JUDGE.

     DEAN is seated next to LEVIN, making notes.

                        LEVIN
               (whispering)
            Dick Burns got a phone call this
            morning from someone wanting
            information on you.

                        DEAN
            The police?

                        LEVIN
            No. He said they were doing a
            credit check. Are you refinancing a
            loan?

                        DEAN
            You remember Daniel Zavitz?

                        LEVIN
            Yeah.

                        DEAN
            He got hit by a bus.

                        LEVIN
            What does that have to do with you?

                        DEAN
            I honestly don't know.

     ANOTHER ATTORNEY sits several rows back, watching the
     proceedings, briefcase in his lap.

     CLOSE-UP on the ATTORNEY's EAR with a mini-receiver.
     From it drift snippets of the DEAN/LEVIN conversation.

                        LEVIN (O.S.)
            Was Zavitz in trouble?

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            I don't know.

     A pulled back leather flap on the ATTORNEY's briefcase
     reveals the tip of a concealed microphone.

                        LEVIN (O.S.)
            You think there was a connection to--

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE GARAGE - DAY

     DEAN waits for the garage attendant to bring down his car.

                        PRATT (O.S.)
            Mr. Dean?

     DEAN turns. TWO MEN, PRATT and BINGHAM approach him.

                        DEAN
            Yeah?

                        PRATT
               (pulling out a card)
            We'd like to ask you some questions
            about Daniel Zavitz.

                        DEAN
            Who are you people?

                        PRATT
               (handing DEAN the card)
            I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech
            Security.

                        DEAN
            I went through this with an
            investigator this morning. If I
            could--

                        PRATT
            Mr. Zavitz was involved in an
            extortion scheme. We believe he
            passed you sensitive materials,
            possibly with your knowledge, and
            we need to--

                        DEAN
            He didn't.

                        PRATT
            We believe he did.

                        DEAN
            You're wrong.

                        PRATT
            We have good reason to believe that
            he passed you--

                        DEAN
            If he passed me materials, I'd have
            them. I don't.

                        PRATT
            We'd like to recover any materials
            Mr. Zavitz may have given you--

                        DEAN
            He didn't give me--

                        PRATT
            --otherwise we may have to--

                        DEAN
            Otherwise you may have to what?

                        PRATT
            We'd rather not--

                        DEAN
            Fuck you. You may have to what?

                        BINGHAM
               (beat)
            We may have to explore additional
            avenues.

     INT. TECH ROOM - NIGHT

     We HEAR a recording of the conversation between DEAN,
     PRATT and BINGHAM while we're CLOSE on an INK NEEDLE
     measuring Dean's voice stress levels.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            He didn't give me--

                        PRATT (V.O.)
            --otherwise we may have to--

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Otherwise you may have to what?

                        PRATT (V.O.)
            We'd rather not--

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Fuck you. You may have to--

     HICKS turns off the recorder. Standing with him is
     REYNOLDS, the Dean file and voice stress graph laid out
     before him.

                        HICKS
            He's arrogant and threatening.
            Voice stress points suggest he's
            worrying.

                        REYNOLDS
            Hiding something?

                        HICKS
            It was in his bag. Now it's not.

                        REYNOLDS
            Destroy his credibility before he
            goes public. Neutralize him. I
            don't want anyone listening to a
            word he has to say. Tell me about
            Rachel Banks.

     EXT. EXMOOR COUNTRY CLUB - EVENING

     Establishing. A massive clubhouse surrounded by
     expensive cars and tended grounds. We HEAR strains of
     Gershwin's "They Can't Take that Away from Me" from inside.

     INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     GUESTS mill about. DEAN and STACY are standing by the
     reception table where name tags and seating assignments
     are laid out. DEAN picks up a card that reads: MR. AND
     MRS. ROBERT DEAN - TABLE 122.

     JERRY steps over and puts his hand on DEAN's shoulder--

                        JERRY
            Can I talk to you a second?

                        DEAN
            Table 122?

                        JERRY
            That's what I want to talk to you
            about?

                        DEAN
            I wrote a check for a thousand
            dollars. You guys didn't have a
            table that was in the kitchen?

     JERRY gently pulls DEAN to a quiet corner...

                        JERRY
            The Congressman's very happy to
            have your support, but he's heard
            that there's an investigation.

                        DEAN
            An investigation? It was a bus
            accident.

                        JERRY
            He's heard that it's escalated.

                        DEAN
            Into what?

                        JERRY
            Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks
            there might be mob ties.

                        DEAN
            I'm a labor lawyer. There are
            always mob ties.

                        JERRY
            Just be cool.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON and OLD MATRON carefully chewing her food near
     a table card declaring: 122. The gala swings everywhere
     but here. DEAN and STACY are the only other diners at
     the table.

                        STACY
            I don't understand why Jerry
            couldn't clear this up.

                        DEAN
            Well, you know--

                        STACY
            He's got his priorities?

                        DEAN
            There's just, clearly, some
            administrative snafu. I'm sure this
            is the worst of it.

     EXT. DEAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     Establishing. A glass and steel high-rise reaching upward.

                        MARTHA (V.O.)
            Mr. Dean?

     INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN sits behind his desk as his secretary MARTHA enters.

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        MARTHA
            It's Rachel Banks.

     DEAN picks up the phone--

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. RACHEL'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

     RACHEL cradles a portable phone to her ear.

                        RACHEL
               (into phone)
            I got a call from my firm this
            morning saying don't come in.

                        DEAN
               (into phone)
            Why?

                        RACHEL
            There are reporters wanting to know
            about my relationship with you and
            how long I've worked for the mob.
            The mob, Bobby!

                        DEAN
            All right, look--

     Before DEAN can respond, there's a knock at the door.

     PEERS sticks his head in--

                        PEERS
            Blake and Silverberg want you in
            the conference room.

                        DEAN
               (softly)
            Shit.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     DEAN sits in the conference room by himself. He waits.

     After a moment, SILVERBERG and BLAKE stride in.

                        DEAN
            Listen--

                        SILVERBERG
            I got a call this morning from a
            source I trust. The Post is running
            a lead this afternoon about your
            involvement in the Bellmoth
            investigation.

                        DEAN
            I don't under--

                        BLAKE
            We've also been informed that the
            Grand Jury is going to call for an
            investigation into your affairs.

                        DEAN
            Why?

                        BLAKE
            They want to hold you in Contempt
            for ethics violations.

                        SILVERBERG
            They claim you helped create a
            shell company for Sam Vollotti in
            Zurich and that through your
            continuing relationship, the
            Gambino family's been able to exert
            influence and provide false
            witnesses to discredit our case.

                        DEAN
            Oh, well, that's true.

                        BLAKE
            It is?

                        DEAN
            Except for the part about my
            setting up a company in Zurich and
            knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti
            and having any relationship
            whatsoever with the Gambino family.

                        SILVERBERG
            Robert--

                        DEAN
            Gimme a week and four guys from
            litigation and I'll have the Post
            pleading with us not to sue for libel.

                        BLAKE
            Tell us about Rachel Banks.

                        DEAN
               (stunned)
            Rachel Banks?

                        SILVERBERG
            The attorney?

                        BLAKE
            Have you two been having an affair?

     DEAN is speechless...

                        DEAN
            What kind of a question is that?

                        BLAKE
            A direct one.

                        DEAN
            I have a professional relationship
            with Rachel Banks. She's the go-
            between for a private investigator
            I use.

                        SILVERBERG
            What's his name?

                        DEAN
            Brill.

                        BLAKE
            Why don't you just call Brill directly.

                        DEAN
            I don't know who he is.

                        BLAKE
            I'm told you had an affair with
            Rachel Banks four years ago.

                        DEAN
            Told by whom?

                        BLAKE
            Considering the enormous exposure
            to which you've subjected this firm,
            I'd think you'd do best to simply
            answer my questions.

                        DEAN
            Really?

                        BLAKE
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            Well considering what a colossal
            douche bag you are, David, maybe
            I'd do best to simply kick your ass
            all over the capitol.

                        SILVERBERG
            Gentlemen--

                        DEAN
            This is bullshit. Someone's mixing
            up a bunch of half-truths to ruin
            me and to ruin my case.

                        SILVERBERG
            Who would do that?

                        DEAN
            Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I
            don't know.

                        SILVERBERG
            Well until we find, you're gonna
            have to take a leave of absence.

                        DEAN
            You're firing me.

                        SILVERBERG
            A leave of absence. Until we've
            sorted this all out.

                        DEAN
            Put David on it. He seems anxious
            to clear my name.

                        SILVERBERG
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            Fuck off.

     INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/FOYER - EVENING

     DEAN enters.

                        DEAN
               (calling)
            Stacy!

     JENNY, early 30's, heads him off--

                        JENNY
            Robert--

                        DEAN
            Where's Stacy?

                        JENNY
            She doesn't want to talk to you.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            What are you talking--

                        JENNY
            She can't talk to you right now.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Why?

                        JENNY
            Because she's reading the newspaper,
            you asshole.

     DEAN pushes past her and heads to the back patio--

     EXT. BACK PATIO - CONTINUOUS

     STACY stares blankly, eyes red. A copy of The Post is
     beside her. A picture of DEAN and RACHEL, arm in arm,
     accompanies a headline.

     DEAN walks in--

                        DEAN
            Stacy?

                        STACY
            How could you let me find out like
            this?

                        DEAN
            Stacy, I found out like this. This
            is the first I'm hearing of--

                        STACY
            Robert--

                        DEAN
            It's not true.

                        STACY
               (reading)
            "Sources revealed an FBI
            investigation into a possible money
            laundering scheme that may have
            sent millions of dollars--

                        DEAN
            I've seen it.

                        STACY
               (reading)
            "At the center of the investigation
            are well-known Washington-area
            attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel
            Banks."

                        DEAN
            Yeah...look--

     STACY whips the paper at him--

                        STACY
            You swore!

                        DEAN
            I have lunch with Rachel once a
            month. She's my connection to an
            investigator.

                        STACY
            I told you I didn't want you seeing
            her.

                        DEAN
            I know.

                        STACY
            You had an affair with this woman,
            Robert, we went to a fucking
            counselor for a year.

                        DEAN
            I see her for business.

                        STACY
            You told me you weren't seeing her
            at all.

                        DEAN
            I didn't want you to be upset. I
            shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's
            nothing between me and Rachel Banks.

     STACY grabs another paper and shoves it across the
     table. DEAN picks it up.

     DEAN'S POV: A black and white surveillance photo of
     DEAN and RACHEL on a hotel balcony.

                        STACY (O.S.)
            The date stamp on the picture is
            last month. Is that where you and
            Rachel conduct business.

                        DEAN
               (shaking his head)
            It's not real...
               (to STACY)
            That's not me.

                        STACY
            Oh, please--

                        DEAN
            It's not a real picture, Stacy,
            it's been doctored-up.

                        STACY
            I think you should leave now, Robert.

                        DEAN
            Stacy--

                        STACY
            Leave this house.

     EXT. HYATT HOTEL - NIGHT

     Establishing. Downtown Washington, D.C.

     INT. REGISTRATION DESK - CONTINUOUS 

     A busy night. DEAN stands at the registration desk
     facing a DESK CLERK.

                        DESK CLERK
               (returning card)
            I'm sorry, sir, this card's been
            declined.

                        DEAN
            It's a brand new card.

                        DESK CLERK
            Maybe it's not connected yet.

                        DEAN
               (handing him another)
            Here, you can use this.

     The CLERK runs it through. Same result.

                        DESK CLERK
            I'm sorry.

     He returns the card, embarrassed for Dean. DEAN turns
     to leave...

     ...and stops dead. He stares at the empty floor by a
     pillar.

                        DEAN
            My suitcase--

                        DESK CLERK
            Sir?

                        DEAN
            My suitcase is gone.

     DEAN walks quickly around the area, looking at
     everything and everyone.

                        DESK CLERK
            I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.

                        DEAN
            Don't count on it.

     EXT. BANK MACHINE - NIGHT

     DEAN stands at the ATM, waiting for cash. There's a
     short line of PEOPLE behind him. His bank card spits
     out. The monitor reads:

                  Temporarily Unable to Process
                         this Transaction

                        DEAN
               (pounding the machine)
            God Dammit!

     The waiting PEOPLE back away...

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE ON AN OLD COLOR TV. The COMMERCIAL ENDS. A
     NEWSCASTER returns to deliver the late-night news.

                        NEWSCASTER
               (on TV)
            In Richmond today, Senate Majority
            Leader Sam Albert paid a visit to
            promote the ten-billion dollar
            Anti-Terror Bill.

     The newscast cuts to SAM ALBERT, late 60's, standing on
     State Capitol Building steps delivering a speech to
     community leaders.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (on TV)
            America is under assault, and this
            time it's from within. The gangs,
            the terrorists, the drug lords, the
            cults...

     PULLING AWAY from the TV, we explore the room. Dimly
     lit and cluttered with tired furniture.

                        SENATOR ALBERT (CONT'D)
               (on TV)
            It's a war like any other war. A
            war with victims and a war that
            requires courage and strength.

     Outside the window, a BUZZING NEON SIGN flickers red
     and blue. We finally end on DEAN, sitting on a sagging
     bed, rubbing his eyes...the newspaper with the
     doctored-up photo is sitting next to him.

     EXT. BUILDING - DAY

     Establishing. Italian area of Baltimore. A 40's era

     INT. ITALIAN/AMERICAN LEGION - CONTINUOUS

     Thread-bare chairs and a couch. SAL and FRANKIE, both
     meaty guys in shiny shirts, sit facing DEAN, who stands
     before them.

                        SAL
            I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand.
            You wanna fuckin' what?

                        DEAN
            I'd like to speak to someone about
            what's happening to me.

                        FRANKIE
               (to SAL)
            What'd this guy say his name was?

                        SAL
            This is Bobby Dean, the Jew lawyer
            who squeezed DePinto.

                        DEAN
            Actually, that's not true.

                        SAL
            You didn't squeeze DePinto?

                        DEAN
            No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.

                        SAL
            Oh.

                        DEAN
            My wife's Jewish. But that probably
            doesn't matter right now.

                        FRANKIE
            What is it you want?

                        DEAN
            Someone's trying to destroy my life,
            and I'd like to find out who.

                        SAL
            And then what?

                        DEAN
            I'll see if I can, you know, work
            things out.

                        FRANKIE
            Well we'd sure like to help you.

                        DEAN
            You would?

                        FRANKIE
            Yes. But we can't.

                        DEAN
            Why not?

                        FRANKIE
            Because we, and our associates,
            have paid out hundreds of thousands
            of dollars to shyster lawyers like
            you, because of shyster lawyers
            like you, and we'd just as soon sit
            back and sip a beer while you get
            ass-banged by as many people as
            possible.

            I know, but--

                        MEG
            Wildlife footage, for God's sake. I
            don't see how he could've slipped
            you something that the FBI would be
            interested in.

                        DEAN
            That's my point.

                        MEG
            What's your point.

                        DEAN
            Well, I need to find out as much
            about Daniel as possible.

                        MEG
            Why?

                        DEAN
            Because my life is being ruined.

                        MEG
            Daniel's life is already ruined.

     Sunlight slashes blinds revealing a place that is wrong
     during the day. JIMMY, a beefy bartender, takes stock
     of the liquor while RACHEL sits in a dark booth.

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            Rachel?

     RACHEL looks up...

                        RACHEL
            Good. You're just what I need right
            now.

                        DEAN
            You got a minute?

                        RACHEL
               (getting up)
            It's really not a good idea for me
            to be seen with you.

                        DEAN
            Who's doing this?

                        RACHEL
            I gotta go.

                        DEAN
               (blocking the door)
            Will you hang on just a second.

                        JERRY
            Rachel? There a problem?

     She looks at DEAN for a moment...

     CLOSE ON a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA on a pole, sweeping,
     making automatic lens corrections.

                        RACHEL (O.S.)
            There's a lot of people asking
            questions about you and me.

     We drift down to the harbor walkway, a greenbelt with
     quaint hotels and bars on one side, Chesapeake Bay on
     the other. DEAN and RACHEL are strolling the walk.

                        DEAN
            I know.

                        RACHEL
            The IRS contacted me this morning.
            They say my lifestyle and receipts
            exceed my income.

                        DEAN
            You being audited?

                        RACHEL
            For the last four years.

                        DEAN
            My firm'll represent you. Free of
            charge.

                        RACHEL
            You don't work there anymore, Bobby.

                        DEAN
            That's temporary.

                        RACHEL
            Bullshit.

                        DEAN
            Rachel--

                        RACHEL
            We're screwed.

                        DEAN
            I'm gonna fix it.

                        RACHEL
            How?

            I can't.

                        DEAN

            You have to.

     DEAN and RACHEL on their stroll--

                        RACHEL
            Fuck you. When you needed
            information, I got it. You didn't
            care how.

                        DEAN
            I did care how.

                        RACHEL
            This conversation's over.

                        DEAN
            What're you gonna do, Rachel? You
            gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore?
            You want your job back? You want a
            life?

                        RACHEL
            I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in
            love with a married man.

                        DEAN
            I'm sorry about that.

                        RACHEL
            What makes you think it's you?

                        DEAN
            It's not me?

                        RACHEL
            You're a moron, you know that?

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

     DEAN smiles...and after a moment, so does RACHEL.

                        RACHEL
            When I need to reach Brill, I chalk
            the mailbox on 14th and Main.

     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

     RACHEL is walking to the mailbox. She casually slashes
     the box with chalk and drops a letter inside.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            When he sees the mark, he knows
            there's a drop. The location's
            always the same.

     EXT. BALTIMORE PORT - DAY

     Establishing. Wharves, ships, seagulls. A water-bus
     chugs dockside as PASSENGERS board for the trip across
     the inlet. DEAN stands in a ticket line with the other
     PASSENGERS.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            The number twelve ferry to Glen
            Burnie. Tuesdays or Fridays.

     INT. FERRY - DAY

     DEAN takes a seat. Across the deck is Seat 74. RACHEL
     takes the seat and casually slides an envelope behind
     it, her actions obscured by a bag she carries. The
     ferry BLOWS its departure horn.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            The drop's behind Seat 74. I leave
            something, he picks it up later.

     The ferry churns water. RACHEL moves to a wind
     protected seat, leaving Seat 74 empty. DEAN keeps watch
     on the seat as he scans the paper.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Any idea what he looks like?

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            My guess is male, somewhere in his
            40's or 50's.

     A MONTAGE of different people occupying Seat 74.

     A middle-aged DRUNK passed out in the seat. A TEEN-AGED
     boy with glasses chats with friends.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            Race, height, weight, you're on
            your own.

     An OLD LADY reads a book. She sees DEAN eyeing her and
     smiles nervously. DEAN returns to his paper.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            Now I don't know how he's gonna
            feel about someone tracking him
            down. He's reclusive. I'm sure he
            has his reasons.

     DEAN's alone now. The ferry docks for the night. The
     last passengers, TWO NUNS, disembark. DEAN rises to go.
     Brill's a no-show.

     INT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT

     DEAN walks down the ramp. It's dark in the empty
     terminal. Not the best place at this hour. Up ahead,
     TWO MEN stand in the darkness, then kissing. Down
     another hall, SOUNDS OF NEARING FOOTSTEPS. DEAN detours
     into--

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Empty. DEAN stands at a sink, water running. He glances
     at the door. He splashes water on his face. Suddenly--

     --DEAN's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved
     into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.

                        DEAN
            Jesus! What?! You want money?!

                        MAN
            Shut the fuck up.

     Hands frisk DEAN. Up and down the legs, behind the back
     and chest. A wallet is removed, ID's looked at - then
     returned. DEAN turns to see--

     A MAN, early 50's. He sweeps a signal frequency locator
     over DEAN's body. The needle reacts at DEAN's foot.

                        MAN
               (gesturing)
            Your shoe.

                        DEAN
            My shoe?

                        MAN
            Gimme the shoe.

     DEAN complies with the strange request as the MAN flips
     out a knife.

                        DEAN
            Brill?

                        "BRILL"
            Brill's dead. He died of small pox
            when he was two and he was buried
            in a Kansas field.
               (prying away DEAN's heel)
            My name doesn't matter.

     CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a
     miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then
     returns the shoe.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            A tracker. Thousand yard range.
            They're close.

     The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip
     bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down
     the toilet.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            C'mon.

     "BRILL" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window,
     not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.

     EXT. LOADING DECK - MOMENT LATER

     DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock.
     "BRILL" motions him to follow as he moves off into the
     shadows.

     The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed
     by FOOTSTEPS. "BRILL" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and
     removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE.
     "BRILL" looks. They're gone.

     EXT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT

     Establishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal.
     Several cars are parked. One's a cab. "BRILL" opens the
     driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door.

                        "BRILL"
            No. In back like you're a customer.

     INT. CAB - NIGHT

     "BRILL" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to
     all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. "BRILL" flips on
     the meter and guns into traffic.

                        "BRILL"
            What happened?

                        DEAN
            It started with the information you
            gave me on DePinto. After we talked,
            he agreed to resign. Next, a phony
            detective asked me about Daniel
            Zavitz. Then an investigator
            questioned me about an extortion
            scheme they claimed Zavitz was
            behind. The FBI started looking
            into mob connections. A doctored
            picture in the paper. Overnight,
            I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank
            accounts, everything gone.

     "BRILL" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several
     car lengths behind.

                        "BRILL"
            DePinto's dead.

                        DEAN
            Oh Jesus.

                        "BRILL"
            They found him yesterday folded
            neatly in a car trunk. What about
            Zavitz?

     "BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks
     in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars
     behind.

                        DEAN
            I don't know anything about Zavitz.

                        "BRILL"
            You said he was behind an extortion
            scheme.

                        DEAN
            They said he was behind an
            extortion scheme.

     "BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.

                        "BRILL"
            And you were the last one to talk
            to him.

                        DEAN
            Yes.

                        "BRILL"
            What'd he say to you?

                        DEAN
            Nothing.

                        "BRILL"
            What'd he give to you?

                        DEAN
            Nothing.

                        "BRILL"
            Don't bullshit me, I can save your
            life.

                        DEAN
            I'm telling you, I--

     The ride from hell gets worse as "BRILL" screeches
     another turn. The car ahead stops and "BRILL" screeches
     past on two wheels.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            I just gave him my card.

                        "BRILL"
            He didn't give you an address? He
            didn't give you a phone number?

                        DEAN
            Nothing. Two nights later I was
            robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.

     "BRILL" takes an impossible left into another alley.
     The Chevy follows. "BRILL"'s good. The guy in the
     Chevy's better.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            Um...who's that?

                        "BRILL"
            Don't know. Did you check everywhere?
            Maybe it was hidden in something.
            Maybe there was someone else--

                        DEAN
            Someone else?

                        "BRILL"
            Maybe you bumped into someone who
            took it and you didn't even know.

     The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks
     snap back from the force.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            Shit!

     WHAM! They're hit again. "BRILL" pulls out a communicator.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            209 to anyone! I need some help here!

                        DEAN
            Who are you calling?!

     WHACK! "BRILL" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking
     him silly as WHAM!--the cab's rear-ended again.

                        "BRILL"
               (trying again)
            This is 209! Does anyone copy?!

     Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy
     street, then a bakery shop.

     He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no
     use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to
     bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel.
     It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross
     traffic and--

     BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab
     is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-
     hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the
     broken main.

     DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere.
     "BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not
     moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and
     crawls from the wreckage.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     DEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach.

                        WOMAN
            Look out! He's got a gun!

     They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks
     around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like
     a coiled snake.

     DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to
     ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.

     INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT

     STACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of
     the paper, which now has a photograph of DEAN and
     RACHEL walking in the park from the day before.

     The phone rings and STACY reaches for it...

                        STACY
               (into phone)
            Hello?

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN stands at a pay phone--

                        DEAN
               (into phone)
            Stacy, don't hang up.

                        STACY
            Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?

                        DEAN
            Stacy--

                        STACY
            I'm looking at a picture of you and
            Rachel taken yesterday.

                        DEAN
            I know, but listen--

                        STACY
            Was that doctored-up, too?

                        DEAN
            No, I was with her yesterday. I
            want you to take Eric and go to our
            parents house. I want you to do it
            right now.

                        STACY
            I went to the grocery store. My ATM
            and credit cards didn't work. I
            couldn't buy food.

                        DEAN
            I know.

                        STACY
            I went to the bank to see why. They
            said you emptied our accounts--

                        DEAN
            It wasn't me.

                        STACY
            This is science-fiction Robert! The
            manager showed me the transfer
            notice with your signature on it.

                        DEAN
            Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me.
            Now goddamit--

                        STACY
            My father's put me in touch with an
            attorney. He'll be--

     A hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. DEAN turns
     to see a MAN, late 50's, gruff and alert. It's the guy
     driving the Chevy.

                        MAN
            Put the phone down. Do as I say.

     DEAN does nothing, temporarily frozen. A pistol jabs
     him hard.

                        DEAN
            Alright, alright--

     DEAN replaces the phone. The man removes DEAN's gun.
     Nearby, two PEOPLE chat at a restaurant hostess desk,
     unaware.

                        MAN
            Move to the elevators.

     DEAN does but is suddenly redirected through a roof-
     access door.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     A TECHNICIAN sits in a van jammed with high-tech
     surveillance gear. HICKS is next to him, a phone
     pressed to his ear.

                        HICKS
            We just picked up his call.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

     REYNOLDS, dressed in a tux, presses his cellular to his
     ear, while behind him MARSHAL and SHAFFER, also in
     tuxedos, have a heated discussion.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            30 minutes ago you said we had him.
            What in hell's goin' on out there?

                        HICKS
               (into phone)
            He had help.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            Help from whom?
               (he hears the answer)
            Christ.

     EXT. HIGH-RISE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Eight stories up and deserted. The lit dome of the
     Capitol building shines like a beacon in the D.C. skyline.

     DEAN suddenly slams against a wall--

                        DEAN
            Hey!

                        MAN
            Forget me, forget what I did for
            you. Don't ever mention my name or
            try to contact me again. Get it?

                        DEAN
            I don't know you, I don't know your
            name, I don't know what the hell
            you did for me except hang up on my
            wife and slam me into a wall, but
            I'm getting pretty fuckin' sick of
            this! Get it?!

                        MAN
            Seat 74.

                        DEAN
               (pause)
            You're Brill.

                        BRILL
            You knew the deal. No contact.

                        DEAN
            Who was that other guy?

                        BRILL
            One of many people who would live a
            word with you.

                        DEAN
            Who are they?

                        BRILL
            You've heard of the National Security
            Agency?

                        DEAN
            What do they have to do with this?

                        BRILL
            That's who they are.

                        DEAN
            The NSA?

                        BRILL
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            You're crazy.

                        BRILL
               (starting to leave)
            Okay.

                        DEAN
            Wait.

                        BRILL
            You drive a black BMW, license
            plate SRK1339?

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        BRILL
               (reaching in his pocket)
            I clipped this from your wheel well
            just before they towed your car away.

     BRILL pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a
     walk-man.

                        DEAN
            What is that?

                        BRILL
            It's a SAT-tracker.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that means.

                        BRILL
            Like a LowJack, but two generations
            ahead of what the police use. It
            pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that means.

                        BRILL
            230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band
            for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that means.

                        BRILL
            It means the NSA can read the time
            off your wristwatch.

                        DEAN
            Why are they after me?

                        BRILL
            If I knew, they'd be after me.
            Which they probably are right now.
            'Bye.

                        DEAN
            Wait. What do I do?

                        BRILL
            Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What
            you did, who you were...that's done.
            I'd find a quiet job somewhere
            shoveling snow.

     A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL
     eyes it cautiously.

                        DEAN
            Why don't they just identify
            themselves and tell me what they want?

                        BRILL
            They're spooks.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that--

                        BRILL
            Exposure. They can't have it. They
            wanna learn what you know and then
            deal with it.

                        DEAN
            I don't know anything.

                        BRILL
            No shit.

                        DEAN
            What am I gonna do?! I mean, like,
            for the rest of my life?!

                        BRILL
            Hey, if you live another week I'll
            be impressed.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            Look, you gave me some work over
            the last year. We'll call it even.

     BRILL turns to leave--

                        DEAN
               (blocking the exit door)
            What if I find out what they're
            after. You know these people, I don't.

                        BRILL
            And you won't. Now move--

                        DEAN
            I'll pay you.

                        BRILL
               (taking out his pistol)
            They froze your accounts. Get outa
            my way.

     DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even
     as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.

                        DEAN
            I've got a hundred-thousand dollars
            in jewelry in a safe-deposit box
            under a third party name.

     BRILL looks at the ground. Torn.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            How many years have you been hiding
            from them? How many years have you
            been running?
               (beat)
            What'd they do to you?

                        BRILL
               (pause)
            If you find something, chalk the
            Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go
            to Temperanceville. It's South of
            Salisbury.
               (giving DEAN his pistol)
            And take this.

     And with that, he's gone.

     DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at
     the city.

     DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the
     building. MEN storm out an move inside.

     DEAN quickly backs away.

     INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     DEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He
     hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            303 to 301. Floor one secured.
            Moving to two.

     DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN.
     Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run
     when he sees a security camera directly above.

     Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray
     coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.

     DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES
     stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left.
     That door's opening as well.

     Trapped.

     Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to
     an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a
     shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He
     retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.

     DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked
     door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he
     rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.

     No lock.

     He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk
     against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.

                        JONES (O.S.)
               (disturbingly calm)
            Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's
            nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk.

     Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.

     No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song
     "These Boots are Made for Walking".

                        JONES (O.S.)
            It'd be easier for all of us if you
            just come out. Nothing'll happen.

     DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.

                        JONES (O.S.)
            It's quite hopeless what you're
            doing, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            I swear to God I'll shoot.

                        JONES (O.S.)
               (chuckling)
            I think you might be over-reacting
            there, Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.

                        DEAN
            Go ahead. I hear you fine.

     The door pushes in--

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            I said I'll shoot!

     The door keeps pushing.

     DEAN FIRES high.

     The pushing stops.

     Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching.
     DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and
     sets the sweater on fire.

     He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam
     cups in on top of it.

     The pushing starts again, but before DEAN can fire, a
     small cylindrical device drops into the room.

     A STUN GRENADE.

     DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.

     The window is blown open. Smoke billows out. DEAN,
     temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as
     fire engines arrive.

     INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

     Fire trucks, police cars and an ambulance arrive
     beneath DEAN as HICKS watches from his van.

                        HICKS
            I don't fuckin' believe this!
               (into radio-mic)
            301 to all units. Everyone out! Now!
            We'll take him at the hospital.

     INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

     DEAN sits in back with a PARA-MEDIC, covered in soot,
     breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance
     WAILS and weaves through traffic. He looks through the
     rear window to see--

     TWO CARS FOLLOWING, keeping pace. Off to the side, RFK
     Stadium is emptying, a Redskins game is over.

     DEAN rips off the oxygen mask--

                        DEAN
            Tell him to stop the ambulance.

                        PARAMEDIC
            Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.

                        DEAN
            Tell him to stop the ambulance.

                        PARAMEDIC
            Now you're a little shaken up, but
            we're gonna get you on your feet in--

     DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the
     PARAMEDIC's face--

                        PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
               (to the driver)
            --stop the ambulance.

                        DEAN
            Thank you.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open.
     DEAN leaps out into the crowd.

     The OTHER CARS pull over and PRATT and JONES exit. They
     scan the area and see DEAN descending a stairwell
     marked: METRO.

     INT. METRO STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT

     DEAN stands at the end of the crowded platform. PRATT
     and JONES work through the CROWD as the train pulls in.
     DEAN slides on board. The departure HORN sounds. JONES
     and PRATT step on.

     INT. METRO - NIGHT

     DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT
     and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.

     DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.

     He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock
     and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.

     DEAN opens the door.

     And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in
     either direction. He starts running.

     Then he hears it.

     The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.

     Trapped.

     On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.

     He runs down the track with all that's left.

     PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the
     oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as
     the train SWISHES by.

     DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing
     greasy ground as the train screeches over him.

     Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.

     Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.

     He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.

                        DEAN
               (under his breath)
            I hate these guys.

     Then he sees an "EMERGENCY ACCESS" sign beaming in the
     darkness. A God-send. DEAN runs for it.

     EXT. METRO EMERGENCY ACCESS EXIT - NIGHT

     PRATT and JONES fly out the door and into a park.

     It's empty. Quiet.

     No Dean anywhere.

                        REYNOLDS (V.O.)
            I'm confused about something. Maybe
            you can help me out.

     EXT. TERRACE - CONTINUOUS

     The Lincoln Memorial is seen in the distance. REYNOLDS
     has broken off PARTY GUESTS and paces in his tux, an
     encrypted cellular phone pressed to his ear.

                        REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
            I sit on top of the greatest
            intelligence gathering organization
            in human history. Why can't I bring
            in a man whose name is in the
            fucking phonebook?!

                        HICKS
            He's clever. He had help.

                        REYNOLDS
            He's clever? He had help?
               (beat)
            Oh.

                        HICKS
            Sir--

                        REYNOLDS
            No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
            you were hoping to be transferred
            to a weathership outside Greenland.

                        HICKS
            I just meant--

                        REYNOLDS
            I don't care if he's Solomon with
            Saint Joseph sitting in his lap. I
            want the tape and I want him. Now is--

     A WAITER with a tray steps out onto the terrace...

                        REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
               (to the WAITER)
            Yes?

                        WAITER
            Puffed cheese?

                        REYNOLDS
            No thank you.

                        WAITER
            I also have tiny pizzas and
            mushrooms stuffed with--

                        REYNOLDS
            Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?

                        WAITER
            No.

                        REYNOLDS
            Then let's assume I don't.

                        WAITER
            Yes sir.

     The WAITER goes back inside.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            Now is that clear?

                        WAITER
            Yes sir.

     REYNOLDS disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to
     the party.

     EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO BUILDING - NIGHT

     DEAN watches from the shadows. It seems quiet. He's
     about to move for the entrance when he sees--

     A cigarette lighter flame-up inside a parked car. TWO
     MEN sit inside, watching. DEAN retreats into the shadows.

     EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Quiet. DEAN listens through the door and hears nothing.
     He KNOCKS softly.

     No reply.

     He tries the doorknob. It opens.

     INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

     DEAN enters. The place is still.

                        DEAN
            Rachel?

     No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp
     is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into
     the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.

     DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.

                        DEAN
               (approaching)
            Rachel?

     She doesn't respond. He touches her.

     Nothing.

     He turns her over. Her face is frozen, eyes open, neck
     purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.

                        DEAN
            Oh God--

     DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down.

     Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it.

     DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is
     stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN.

     Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for
     anything else of his that may have been planted inside
     the apartment.

     Under the bed - a cufflink.

     In the bathroom - a hairbrush.

     On the desk - documents with his name on them.

     DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a
     towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from
     everything he touched.

     Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--

     A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing,
     kissing...and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.

     INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     JERRY walks alone through the large underground garage
     on the way to his car. He pauses, thinking he's heard
     something.

     Nothing.

     He continues walking. He reaches his car. Suddenly
     someone comes up behind him fast. JERRY spins--

     --it's DEAN.

                        DEAN
               (whispering)
            Jerry--

                        JERRY
            Christ!

                        DEAN
            Ssh!

                        JERRY
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            It's the NSA. They're the ones
            doing this.

                        JERRY
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            The NSA's doing this 'cause they
            think I have something. And they
            killed--

                        JERRY
            Calm down.

                        DEAN
            They killed Rachel.

                        JERRY
               (pause)
            Rachel's dead?

                        DEAN
            Yes.

                        JERRY
            Jesus.

                        DEAN
            My stuff's all over her apartment.

                        JERRY
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            They're framing me.

                        JERRY
            Why would they--

                        DEAN
            I don't know. I mean--

                        JERRY
            Why would the NSA--

                        DEAN
            I don't know!

                        JERRY
            You're tired.

                        DEAN
            Jerry--

                        JERRY
            Listen to me.

                        DEAN
            You gotta--

                        JERRY
            No, listen to me. You gotta let me
            bring you in.

                        DEAN
            No, I--

                        JERRY
            You gotta let me bring you in to
            the police.

                        DEAN
            I won't make it to the police. They
            won't let me get there. You go.

                        JERRY
            To the cops?

                        DEAN
            To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em
            to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what
            they're after. Make a deal.

                        JERRY
            Bobby, you're in way over your head.

                        DEAN
            Go to 'em, Jerry.

                        JERRY
            I have a family.

                        DEAN
            So do I!

     JERRY looks at the ground for a long moment...

                        JERRY
            I'm sorry, man.

                        DEAN
            No. No, it's okay.

     DEAN starts to leave...

                        JERRY
            Bobby? Piece of advice?

                        DEAN
            Yeah?

                        JERRY
            Turn yourself in.

                        DEAN
            Jerry?

                        JERRY
            Yeah?

                        DEAN
            Go fuck yourself.

     EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

     Establishing. A quiet street in Dean's neighborhood.
     Several REPORTERS are camped in Dean's driveway
     entrance, sipping coffees. Farther down the street, a
     JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked. The driver waits and
     watches.

     EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME

     DEAN sneaks between two large houses, ducking by
     windows and scaling a fence. Somewhere a DOG BARKS a
     warning as DEAN plows through a large hedge, entering
     the backyard to his home.

     INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - SAME TIME

     DEAN quietly unlocks the door and enters. He listens.

     The house is quiet. Empty.

     INT. DEAN'S FOYER - DAY

     KEYS JINGLE in the front lock. The door opens and STACY
     enters.

     The TV suddenly REMOTES ON - VOLUME LOUD.

     She turns as DEAN approaches fast--

                        STACY
            Robert--

     DEAN's hand cups her mouth as he pulls her into a
     pantry closet.

     INT. PANTRY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

                        DEAN
               (barely a whisper)
            Listen to me. The house is bugged.
            So we gotta be quiet, okay?

     STACY nods understanding. DEAN slowly removes his hand.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
               (whispering)
            Is Eric in school?

                        STACY
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?

                        STACY
            Just reporters.

                        DEAN
            I wish you'd gone to your parents
            like I asked you.

                        STACY
            This is my house. Nobody's kicking
            me out of my house. I picked those
            drapes.

                        DEAN
            I don't think anybody wants the
            drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes
            are okay.

                        STACY
            What happened to your head?

                        DEAN
            I was in a car chase and a small
            explosion. Now listen to me: The
            NSA is behind this. They think that
            guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz,
            they think Zavitz gave me a tape or
            computer chip of some kind that
            could be damaging to them. So
            they're doing all these things
            electronically. The bank records,
            the surveillance. They're the ones
            who broke into the house. Now I
            know there's no reason to believe
            me. But I love you. And I love our
            son. So just believe me anyway.
               (pause)
            Please.

     STACY gently touches his forehead where he's been cut...

                        STACY
            Does that hurt?

                        DEAN
            Well...yeah.

                        STACY
            Good.

                        DEAN
            Stacy--

     She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good
     long time before STACY smacks him on the arm--

                        STACY
            I told you they could do this. I
            told you they had this kind of
            capability and that with this anti-
            terrorism it would be just another--

                        DEAN
            Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the
            best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.

     She kisses him again.

                        STACY
            I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

                        DEAN
            That's okay.

                        STACY
            I opened the present you got me
            from Harrison's.

                        DEAN
            You opened the thing?

                        STACY
            The lingerie.

                        DEAN
            That was for Christmas.

                        STACY
            I was missing you.

                        DEAN
            You're as bad as Eric. I've got an
            entire family of people who root
            through--

     It dawns on him...everything starts coming together...

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            ...who root through...uh...presents,
            and...

                        STACY
            What is it?

                        DEAN
            Oh Christ.

     INT. JEEP GRAND-CHEROKEE - DAY

     The DRIVER continues to watch the area. Then--

     DRIVER's POV: THE RANGE ROVER flies out of the driveway,
     tires SCREECHING as it speeds through the quiet
     neighborhood.

     The REPORTERS stare at each other a beat--

     --then leap for their cars.

                        DRIVER
               (into sleeve-mic)
            504 to 501. Rover's fleeing west on
            Sutton. Driver appeared male!

                        JONES (O.S.)
               (radio effect)
            What's the wife's '20'?

                        DRIVER
            She's off location with a friend.

                        JONES (O.S.)
            Alright - move! 501 - all units.
            Take him down!

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Unmarked cars of various descriptions rapidly appear
     from nowhere giving chase.

                        ANOTHER AGENT (O.S.)
               (radio effect)
            502 to 501, I've got the eyeball.
            He's approaching Ridgeview, we'll
            take him at the intersection.

     The RANGE ROVER speeds through the neighborhood.
     Suddenly, two cars are out in front, blocking the way.
     The Range Rover swerves and breaks as two more cars rip
     up behind, boxing it in. An un-marked Trans-Am lags
     behind, keeping reporters at bay.

     Doors fling open. JONES and THREE MEN, all in plain
     clothes, pistols and MAC-10 aimed at the Range Rover.

     Nothing happens.

     The MEN move closer--

     JONES grabs the door and rips it open, revealing Dean's
     PISS-FRIGHTENED NANNY behind the wheel in Dean's trench
     coat and hat.

     JONES YANKS her out, puts her hard to the ground, gun
     jammed to her head, as other search the Range Rover for
     Dean.

     EXT. DEAN'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN drives the Nanny's rusted, low-rider Dodge out of
     the driveway. He pauses and looks. The streets are empty.

     He turns onto the street and calmly drives away.

     EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

     Establishing. A playground jammed with kids. A kickball
     game's in progress. ERIC waits his turn to kick. TRACY,
     a college-age teaching assistant comes over.

                        TRACY
            Eric?

     ERIC looks up...

                        TRACY (CONT'D)
            Your father's here.

     EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

     DEAN stands at the edge of the playground in clean,
     casual clothes. ERIC runs over, face glowing.

                        ERIC
            Dad!

                        DEAN
            Do I know you?

                        ERIC
            Where've you been?

                        DEAN
            Having an adventure. I can't tell
            you about it right now, but I'll
            tell you about it soon.

                        ERIC
            Are you and mom getting a divorce?

                        DEAN
            No. We're never getting a divorce.
            We were having a fight. It happens
            sometimes.

                        ERIC
            Who won the fight?

                        DEAN
            Men don't win fights with women,
            son, I'll tell you about that
            sometime, too. In the meantime,
            I've got a question for you, and
            it's incredibly important that you
            tell me the truth. Under no
            circumstances will I be angry with
            you. This is a total Get-Out-Of-
            Jail-Free card. Ready?

                        ERIC
            Yeah.

                        DEAN
            Did you take anything--anything at
            all--out of those Christmas bags I
            brought home last week.

     ERIC hangs his head...busted...then shouts to a GROUP
     OF KIDS on the playground...

                        ERIC
               (shouting)
            DYLAAAAN!!

     DYLAN comes trotting over, carrying his backpack...

                        DYLAN
            Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?

                        DEAN
            Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--

                        DYLAN
            Oh, God, I knew it was stupid, I
            knew we'd get caught. But the
            Gameboy was just sitting there.
            Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes.
            We took the GameBoy out of the bag,
            but with every intention of putting
            it back.

                        DEAN
               (pause)
            You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.

     DYLAN hunts through the backpack as DEAN and ERIC looks
     on. All kinds of junk flies out--candy, comics, game-
     cartridges--

                        DYLAN
            It was broken when we found it, I
            swear. I tried fixing it for you. I
            even put in new batteries.
               (pulling out the GameBoy)
            The screen scrambles whenever you
            boot up. I'd try to get your money
            back.

     DEAN eyes the pieces of the GameBoy, knowing that
     somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key
     to his problems.

     EXT. BALTIMORE SHERATON - EVENING

     PEDESTRIANS walk on the sidewalk. A MAN comes along and
     drops a few letters in the corner mailbox.

     From the other direction comes DEAN. Without stopping,
     he casually slashes the mailbox with chalk.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     DEAN's asleep. There's a SOFT SHUFFLING SOUND. The
     CAMERA EXPLORES for the source, moving by the windows,
     flashing neon, a TV and finally, the door.

     We PUSH CLOSER as a MULE TOOL snakes under the door.

     The tool pops upright against the door's inside. The
     strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens. The
     doorknob turns and opens.

     SOMEONE slips in--

     CLOSE ON DEAN asleep. A HAND covers his mouth. DEAN's
     eyes go wide.

     Then he sees it's BRILL...

                        BRILL
               (whispering)
            Get dressed. We're leaving.

                        DEAN
               (whispering)
            You could knock on the door, you
            know, and I'd open it.

                        BRILL
            Move it.

     EXT. CAPE CHARLES - 4 A.M.

     Establishing. The 10-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge crosses
     the Bay like a serpent worming toward distant Norfolk.
     Traffic is thin at this hour.

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
            Dean, the attorney recently under
            investigation for a money laundering
            scheme, was seen leaving Ms. Banks
            apartment late last night.

     We PUSH IN on a TOYOTA PICK-UP truck heading south.

     INT. PICK-UP - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL drives with DEAN riding shotgun.

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
            Police are seeking--

     BRILL ejects as cassette from the dashboard and hands
     it to DEAN.

                        BRILL
            I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.

                        DEAN
            And you were worried about me.
            That's nice, I appreciate--

                        BRILL
            I was worried about my hundred and
            twenty 'K'.

                        DEAN
            We said a hundred.

                        BRILL
            The price rises with the temperature
            and right now you're smokin'. But
            you're right, you should shop
            around and get the best price. I'll
            just let you out here.

                        DEAN
               (agreeing)
            One-twenty.

     BRILL checks the rear-view mirror.

     BRILL's POV: Car headlights following in the distance.

                        BRILL
            Did you call anyone?

                        DEAN
            What do you mean?

                        BRILL
            I mean did you call anyone.

                        DEAN
            Look, my wife is understandably--

                        BRILL
            Jesus!

                        DEAN
            I called my wife!

                        BRILL
            What'd I tell you?

                        DEAN
            I didn't use my name.

                        BRILL
            What'd I tell you?

                        DEAN
            I called from a payphone!

                        BRILL
            What'd I tell you?

                        DEAN
            You told me no calls.

                        BRILL
            I told you no calls.

     BRILL does a bootleggers U-turn. Several cars pass by
     in the opposite direction.

                        DEAN
            Sorry.

                        BRILL
            You don't get it. They go through
            your phone records. They fuckin'
            monitor everyone you called in the
            last--

                        DEAN
            I didn't use my name.

                        BRILL
            Oh, I'll bet that threw 'em off the
            scent. I sure hope you covered the
            mouthpiece with a handkerchief and
            used a funny voice!

     BRILL turns off the headlights, does another U-turn,
     pulls off on an emergency road and stops.

     He turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks
     up into the night sky and listens.

     BRILL's POV: A cloudy night. Silent except for the
     water and a distant fog-horn. No sounds of aircraft.

                        DEAN
               (looking up as well)
            I don't hear anything.
               (on BRILL's silence)
            Maybe you're wrong.

     BRILL is staring upward...

                        BRILL
            A hundred and fifty.

     INT. NRO KEYHOLE-12 LAB - CONTINUOUS

     Re-establishing. A massive, dark place filled with
     glowing monitors.

     CLOSE ON A MONITOR - displaying a live SAT feed showing
     a thermograph image of Brill's truck. The color heat
     image of BRILL looking upward is fairly clear. He pops
     his head back into the truck and pulls onto the road.
     The satellite continues tracking the truck.

                        BRILL (O.S.)
            It's a consumated marriage.

     INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT

     BRILL drives along a high fence surrounding acres of
     empty warehouses, docks and rust-bitten fences. He's
     still on constant alert - looking for sign of their
     presence.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            The NSA's been in bed with the
            entire tele-communications industry
            since the 40's. They've infected
            everything: Banks, computers,
            phones, mail, name it.
               (stopping the car near
                the gate)
            The more technology we buy into,
            the easier it is keeping tabs on us.
            It's a brave new world.
               (handing DEAN the keys)
            At least it better be.

                        DEAN
            How do you know so much?

                        BRILL
            None of your business.

                        DEAN
            You used to work for 'em, didn't you?

                        BRILL
            I was a traffic analyst.

     DEAN gives him a look that says, "I don't know what
     that means".

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            I intercepted phone calls.

                        DEAN
            How'd you get around the tap orders?

                        BRILL
            They can tap anything as along as
            it's an airwave intercept.
            Cellulars and pagers your kid can
            do.
               (driving through)
            Hard-line calls we'd pick off the
            relays as they were being fed into
            ground cables or fired up to the
            SATs. We'd suck in everything. All
            foreign, most domestic.
               (DEAN re-closes the gate)
            Domestic was my group. Druggies,
            radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we
            wanted.

                        DEAN
               (climbing back in)
            How'd you have the manpower to--

                        BRILL
               (driving again)
            Meade has 18 underground acres of
            computers. They scan every
            phonecall for target words like
            "bomb" or "President". We red-flag
            phone numbers or voice
            prints...whatever we wanted. When
            the computers found something, it
            was bounced to comparative analysis.

                        DEAN
            Jesus.

                        BRILL
            That was twenty years ago. With
            digital? They can suck a salt grain
            off a beach.

                        DEAN
            Why'd you leave?

                        BRILL
            It was '72. I figured we had enough
            problems without monitoring a
            Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I
            sold my story to Ramparts and split.

                        DEAN
            They come after you?

                        BRILL
               (shrugging it off)
            Well...there'd be too much
            disclosure to prosecute me. So they
            ruined my records and made sure I'd
            never hold a real job again.

     The pick-up stops by a long two-story warehouse.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            What do you think?

                        DEAN
            Looks like Detroit.

                        BRILL
            Welcome to Santa's Workshop.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     BRILL and DEAN enter the 2nd story of a large, empty
     structure. DEAN is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag.

     In the center of the cavernous space, a windowless,
     cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.

                        BRILL
            I call it the jar. No phone or
            utility lines going in.

     BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He
     pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.

                        BRILL
            Self-contained. Unplugged from the
            world.
               (opening Jar door)
            Nothing for a wire bug to piggy-
            back in on. That leaves only
            transmitters and signal sweep for
            those.
               (turning on the light)
            Now let's see what we got.

     DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its
     contents (the pieces of the GameBoy) on to the table.

     EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

     DEAN sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching
     Norfolk rise from dawn's fog.

     In the distance we see BRILL coming down from the
     warehouse toward DEAN.

     He stands behind DEAN for a moment before...

                        BRILL
            That is one ugly sunrise.

                        DEAN
               (pause)
            It really is.
               (pause)
            Did you find anything?

                        BRILL
            Yeah.
               (beat)
            Take a walk with me.

     DEAN gets up and joins BRILL. The two of them start in
     the direction of the second warehouse.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            Remember when Senator Hamersley
            died in an accident up near Shenandoah?

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        BRILL
            The NSA killed him.

                        DEAN
            Jesus. Do you have proof?

                        BRILL
            Well, actually, you have proof.
            Could you walk a little faster please.

                        DEAN
            What's going on?

                        BRILL
            They're here.

                        DEAN
            Who?

                        BRILL
            Them.

                        DEAN
            Where?

                        BRILL
            Here?

                        DEAN
            Here?!

                        BRILL
            In the warehouse. They're hiding in
            a duct on the third floor. When we
            go back inside, they're gonna kill
            us. When they notice that we're
            moving toward the car, they'll come
            running out of the building.

                        DEAN
            'Kay, well, could you walk faster,
            please.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     JONES and THREE MEN are huddled in a duct.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
               (through radio)
            They're heading to the car.

                        JONES
            Move it.

     JONES and the three men start down the corridor, guns
     drawn.

     EXT. THE SECOND WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting
     the air out of the tires.

                        BRILL
            Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat.
            And turn your head. There might be
            some debris flying your way.

                        DEAN
            Why?

     And with that, THE FIRST WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, sending a
     fireball of debris in all directions.

                        DEAN
            What the fuck?!

                        BRILL
            They shouldn't have come without
            calling first.

     BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the
     engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas
     and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the
     warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a
     remote. The door rises.

     OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward,
     screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined
     with warehouses.

     DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a
     Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.

                        BRILL
            Where's your gun?

     They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns,
     heading straight at them.

                        DEAN
            Back at the warehouse.

     The Saturn pulls on the road behind them. The MAN in
     the Saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. The
     side window by Dean's head shatters.

     BRILL one-hands the pistol and checks the load.

                        DEAN
               (re: the pistol)
            Gimme that.

                        BRILL
            You sure?

                        DEAN
            You're driving.

                        BRILL
            Those are Feds.

                        DEAN
               (taking the pistol)
            I didn't see a warrant. Did you see
            a warrant?

     The Chevy enters a narrow lane, the Saturn right behind.
     With the Chevy's tires flat and flapping, the Saturn
     hugs their rear. DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN
     FIRES--

     The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three
     quick, well-placed rounds.

     The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.

     DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an
     iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster.
     Beam or no beam, he's going through.

                        BRILL
            Think we let out enough air?

                        DEAN
               (realizing)
            Oh my God...

     BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes
     just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the
     full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass,
     decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side
     minus roof and windows as--

     --the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and
     debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--

     --but the Chevy disappears around a building.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

     A foggy morning. The rural highway's deserted at this
     early hour. The Chevy rumbles by...

     INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN and BRILL, windblown but alive, remove shards of
     glass. BRILL eyes the road behind him.

     Empty.

                        BRILL
            We lost 'em.

                        DEAN
            That wasn't so hard.

                        BRILL
            Fuckin-A.

                        DEAN
            Let's not do the tire thing anymore,
            okay?

                        BRILL
            Yeah, I can see where that'd--

     He stops talking.

     He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears
     over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down.

     BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as
     BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-
     plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims
     with an M-16.

     A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the
     Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.

                        BRILL
            These guys are incredibly persistent.

                        DEAN
            Tell me about it.

     The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel.

     More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts
     hissing. The Chevy starts dying.

     BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick
     of horsepower.

     Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly.

     The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.

     INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

     The SHARP-SHOOTER lines DEAN in his sights.

     The PILOT keeps pace, dropping closer. The SHARP-
     SHOOTER has the shot.

     The Chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking,
     screeching wheel rims.

     The helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.

     But not the power lines. The PILOT sees them too late.
     The helicopter flies into a web of cables. The upper
     rotor slices neatly off. The helicopter's body rockets
     downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a
     rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck
     head-on.

     BLAM!

     EXT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't
     work. The car shimmies like it's on ice. Sparks fly as
     they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.

     INT. DODGE - CONTINUOUS

     A GRUNGE-DUDE blasts his car-stereo as he enters the
     tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him.

     He slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead.

     Closer, he sees DEAN waving him down. He slows more.
     Bad move.

     BRILL opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his
     pistol at the GRUNGE-DUDE's face.

     DEAN leaps in front.

                        BRILL
            Drive.

                        DEAN
            We're not gonna hurt you.

                        BRILL
            Drive.

                        DEAN
            Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.

                        BRILL
            Drive or I'll blow your fuckin'
            head off.

                        DEAN
            No he won't.

                        BRILL
            Goddammit--

                        DEAN
            We're honest people and we need
            your help. I'll give you two-
            hundred dollars if you--

                        GRUNGE-DUDE
               (leaping out)
            Take it!

                        DEAN
            Actually, I don't have two-hundred
            dollars.

                        BRILL
            Drive the damn car!

     DEAN slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear
     and goes.

     The Dodge erupts from the tunnel.

     Up ahead, the Saturn and another car approach fast in
     the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening.
     The car's fly by, unaware of DEAN and BRILL passing in
     the Dodge.

     The Dodge continues on, fading into the fog.

     INT. NSA/CORRIDOR - DAY

     REYNOLDS and HICKS walk down a white hallway three
     football fields in length, filled with bustling
     employees conservatively dressed.

                        HICKS
            We found two sets of latent prints
            in the rubble of Brill's studio.
            One was Dean's. The other, we
            believe, belongs to Brill.

                        REYNOLDS
            We believe?

                        HICKS
            Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.

                        REYNOLDS
            Lyle?!

                        HICKS
            Yes sir.

                        REYNOLDS
            You're kidding me.

                        HICKS
            No sir.

                        REYNOLDS
            Dean's with Lyle.

                        HICKS
            And they have the video. That's
            confirmed.

                        REYNOLDS
            So they know everything.

                        HICKS
            If they've looked at the video.

                        REYNOLDS
            Oh, let's assume that they have.

                        HICKS
            If he's with Lyle it means he's got
            resources.

                        REYNOLDS
            Resources, that's a good point.
            He's got resources. All we've got
            is a six-hundred billion dollar
            organization! Now goddammit, Hicks,
            you find 'em. You find 'em and you
            end it now!

     REYNOLDS walks off leaving HICKS to ponder his fate.

     EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

     Establishing. Plastic flags and PRICES SLASHED signs
     are everywhere. A blue Taurus pulls off the lot...

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            We'll take the tape directly to CBS.
            I'll hand it directly to the News
            Department.

     INT. TAURUS - CONTINUED

                        BRILL
            Listen to you, "directly". You're
            not gonna get near the News
            Department. And if you did, it'd
            never get on the air. Time-Life
            buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.

                        DEAN
            What about newspapers and magazines?

                        BRILL
            Same thing?

                        DEAN
            So what do we do now?

                        BRILL
            I was thinkin' about asking for my
            hundred and fifty grand and calling
            it quits.

                        DEAN
            What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.

                        BRILL
            It'd never get through. All
            packages are screened, x-rayed and
            then hand-searched for explosives.
            You didn't like my "give-me-my-
            money" idea?

     INT. TAURUS - NIGHT

     BRILL drives. DEAN thinks.

                        DEAN
            What if we hand deliver to their
            homes or office?

                        BRILL
            The area's wired for surveillance,
            they'll be looking for those moves.

                        DEAN
            Well how do I know what they're--

                        BRILL
            I know. I know what they're looking
            for and I'm telling you.

     The car radio is playing a newscast...

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
               (from the radio)
            --after which, Senator Albert will
            address a fund-raiser at Boston
            University.

                        DEAN
            What if we put it on the internet?

                        BRILL
            Have you seen how fuckin' slow the
            net is? It'd take ten minutes to
            unload enough video so that people
            know what they're seeing, and it'd
            take the NSA maybe 40 seconds to
            see it coming down and shut down
            the access.

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
               (from the radio)
            --this will be the last stop on the
            Senator's eight-city tour before
            the Senate votes on Tuesday.

                        BRILL
               (reconsidering)
            But maybe if there were no phone
            line--

     DEAN has started listening to the radio...

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            What if we transmitted it over
            cellular?

                        DEAN
            Listen--

                        BRILL
            Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            If they couldn't do that, they'd
            shut down the whole system, all the
            relays.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            They've done it before. Takes maybe
            two minutes.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            What if what?

                        DEAN
            What if we just fucked with 'em?

                        BRILL
               (pause)
            How?

                        DEAN
            Same way they did with you and me.
            We take their biggest guy and turn
            him into one of us.

                        BRILL
            Reynolds.

                        DEAN
            No.

                        BRILL
            Who?

     A MONTAGE OF EVENTS:

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     BRILL educates DEAN on simple ways to alter one's
     appearance.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Senator Sam Albert, senior
            Republican. Very well respected.

     INT. BOSTON UNIVERSITY/AUDITORIUM - DAY

     A large auditorium. Preparations are being made for
     Senator Albert's upcoming speech. BRILL and DEAN
     casually case the area for vulnerabilities.

                        DEAN
            We'll play the NSA's game only
            we'll play it badly.

     EXT. LE MERIDIAN HOTEL, BOSTON - DAY

     Establishing. A five-star hotel overlooking
     Massachusetts Bay.

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            You wanna get caught spying on Albert?

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            No, I want the NSA to get caught
            spying on Albert.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     CHRISTA HAWKINS, late 20's, the Senator's advance-
     person, stands at registration securing rooms for her
     boss and his team.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            We're gonna lead Albert by the nose
            to one conclusion. And then when
            he's pissed as hell, we're gonna
            drop the tape in his lap. How fast
            can you teach me what I need to know?

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            How fast can you learn?

     Next to CHRISTA, looking conservative and altered in
     appearance, is DEAN, eavesdropping on the Senator's
     room numbers and any other pertinent info.

     EXT. RADIO SHACK - DAY

     Establishing. One of those cheesy places in a mini-mall.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Pretty fast.

                        BRILL
            We'll have to re-stock some basics.

     INT. RADIO SHACK - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL and DEAN go shopping.

                        BRILL
            Bugs, frequency scanners, contact
            mics, transmitters, pin-holes,
            fiber optics--

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn. Devices cover the table and bed.

                        BRILL
            What do you know about locking
            cellular phone signals?

                        DEAN
            I know my phone number and I know
            the number for SportsPhone. Beyond
            that--

                        BRILL
            Shit.

     INT. TAURUS - DAY

     DEAN drives while BRILL sits with his open PC lap-top
     connect to his cellular phone.

                        BRILL
            A 'modified' OKI 900 interfaced
            with a lap-top creates an enormously
            powerful tool.
               (referring to the cell-phone)
            I got into the software, did some
            code re-writing and turned it into
            one of the best scan-looking
            systems around.

     CLOSE ON SCREEN - A street map appears with positions
     of the network's relays. Lines appear indicating all
     in-progress cellular calls along with their locations.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            This is every call on the grid. I
            can lock and position any one I
            want and follow the hand-offs in
            real time.

     BRILL punches a number into the cellular and the phone
     locks on the signal. Through the lap-top, we hear
     RINGING and then an ANSWERING VOICE.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Super Shuttle.

                        MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            This is Dr. Jonathan Phillips, 102
            Stern Drive in Brockton. I need an
            airport ride on Friday at 6 PM with
            a return pick-up Monday at 5.
            There'll be two of us and--

                        BRILL
               (disconnecting)
            Need a place to stay for the
            weekend? A new TV?
               (BRILL has repeated the process)

                        ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Triple-A Emergency Road Service.
            May I have your name and membership
            number?

                        DEAN
            Unbelievable.

                        BRILL
            All from a hundred dollar scanner
            at Radio Shack. But it's time for
            business.

     BRILL dials his computer into a new line. TONES and
     COMMANDS fly quick as Brill's computer modems into another.

                        DEAN
            What are you dialing?

                        BRILL
            AmeriTech's data-base.
               (pointing on the screen)
            There's Albert's D.C. office
            address and his phone's identity
            code. Now we just reprogram out
            phone with his ID code and you know
            what we've got?

                        SENATOR ALBERT (O.S.)
               (mid-conversation)
            --Don't think it could've gone any
            better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're
            my grandchildren?

                        BRILL
            A receiver tuned permanently to the
            Senator's phone.

     EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

     A customized RV zips down the highway.

                        SENATOR'S WIFE (O.S.)
            Melissa has a fever. When will you
            be in the room?

     INT. RV - CONTINUOUS

     It's a plush affair befitting the Senator's position.
     ALBERT speaks in the cellular phone while an aide,
     PATRICK, reviews last minute changes for Albert's
     upcoming speech.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Not 'till later tonight. We're
            going to the campus now.
               (beat)
            I'll call you after I've checked in.
               (beat)
            I love you too, dear.

     INT. LE MERIDIAN HOTEL/LOBBY - DAY

     CHRISTA stands at the front desk as the CLERK hands her
     several faxes.

     DEAN, disguised, sits across the lobby reading a paper.

     DEAN's POV: CHRISTA exits the hotel to a waiting car.

                        DEAN
               (into concealed sleeve mic)
            She just left.

     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Numbered doors on each side. BRILL walks down the hall,
     hair slicked, mustache, wearing a suit and carrying a
     briefcase.

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            The important thing about
            installations is numbers.

     INT. CHRISTA'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     SERIES OF SHOTS:

     BRILL entering CHRISTA's room and opening his briefcase
     revealing tools and listening bugs.

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            They may find one, but they're not
            gonna find 'em all.

     --BRILL planting devices behind the headboard--

     --Inside the telephone--

     --Behind the desk--

     --Inside the TV--

     --BRILL rifling through CHRISTA's personal items,
     eyeing paper work, photographing interesting documents.

     --BRILL opening a connecting door, picking a second
     lock, and entering the adjoining suite.

     INT. CHRISTA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     A clock reads 1:28 AM. The lights are on and the bed
     unslept in. Christa's not seen. Then the connecting
     door opens--

     CHRISTA steps from the Senator's adjoining suite in a
     silk robe, nothing underneath. She turns in the doorway,
     revealing ALBERT, naked in a towel.

     CHRISTA closes the door, climbs in bed and grabs the
     remote. She clicks on the TV.

     FEEDBACK SCREECHES from the set.

     She tries changing channels but the SCREECHING
     continues. She tries turning off the set, but it won't
     turn off. She grabs the phone and dials.

                        CHRISTA
               (into phone)
            Can you send someone up right away.
            I'm having a problem with my TV...
            It's screeching and I--
               (beat)
            It's screeching and I--

     CHRISTA is noticing that her voice is causing the TV
     image to distort in sync.

                        CHRISTA (CONT'D)
            It's screeching and I can't turn it
            off.

     INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - MORNING

     SENATOR ALBERT dines with an aide as PATRICK approaches,
     a grave look on his face. PATRICK takes a seat.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            What happened to you last night?

     PATRICK reaches in his case and pulls out one of
     Brill's listening bugs and hands it to ALBERT who puts
     on his eyeglasses.

                        PATRICK
            Christa found it last night
            attached to her TV. It's a
            listening device.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            A bug?

                        PATRICK
            Yeah.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Jesus H.--

                        PATRICK
            We should everything checked.
            There's a company in Cambridge
            called Baudmore. They're discreet.

     Seated next to ALBERT's table is DEAN, unnoticed as he
     sips coffee, skims news, and eavesdrops on their
     MURMURS with a small, concealed parabolic mic and ear-
     phone.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Well get somebody down here today.
            I don't know what the hell this is
            all about.

     EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

     A phone distribution box is open, revealing a mass of
     circuit boards. BRILL stands at the box holding a
     circuit-dialer phone to his ear.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY/NEWS STAND - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN watches PATRICK approach a pay phone.

                        DEAN
               (into sleeve mic)
            He's going into the payphone
            outside the restaurant. It's a
            Cambridge company called Baudmore.

     BRILL connects two alligator clips to a line inside the
     box.

                        BRILL
               (into sleeve mic)
            Got it.

     BRILL's phone line immediately rings. He waits...then
     answers.

                        BRILL
               (into phone)
            Baudmore Consultants.

                        PATRICK
            Is Jerry Delsano in?

                        BRILL
            Who's calling?

                        PATRICK
            It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator
            Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's
            name.

                        BRILL
            Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I
            can give him the message when he
            gets back. That was Patrick and the
            last name--

                        PATRICK
            The thing is...it really can't wait.

                        BRILL
            My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.

     INT. SENATOR ALBERT'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE ON A FREQUENCY COUNTER sweeping a chest of
     drawers. The device starts BUZZING, indicating a
     transmitter.

     BRILL, disguised, is on hands and knees, searching
     under a chest where he 'discovers' a bug he planted
     earlier.

                        BRILL
               (removing the transmitter)
            Oh yeah. Got another one here.

     BRILL shows it to PATRICK, a very embarrassed HOTEL
     MANAGER and a very serious HEAD OF HOTEL SECURITY.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            Nasty fella. A TX-703. Remote on-
            off, three-thousand foot range.
            Shit, you could listen from a
            shopping mall across the street.

     INT. SENATOR ALBERT'S RV - DAY

     BRILL stands in front of SENATOR ALBERT.

                        BRILL
            Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as
            simple as that. Your average
            newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or
            whatever, they can't buy this stuff.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Well then who can?

                        BRILL
            Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me
            to say.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            What do you mean? Who can buy this
            kind of equipment.

                        BRILL
            The thing is, Senator, and I don't
            want to get in the middle of
            nothing, but--

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            What are you saying?

                        BRILL
            Most of this stuff's only available
            to law enforcement.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Law enforcement?

                        BRILL
            FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Are you sure about this?

     BRILL unwraps a towel revealing the grease-covered NSA
     tracker he removed from Dean's BMW.

                        BRILL
            I yanked this off your RV. It's a
            Global Positioning Tracker.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Oh my God.

                        BRILL
            Tracks your location to the inch
            and works directly with--you know...

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            With what?

                        BRILL
            With spy satellites. I don't like
            saying these things Senator...

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (shaking BRILL's hand)
            Neil, thank you for your help.

                        BRILL
            Anytime.

     PATRICK escorts BRILL out of the RV.

     The SENATOR, fuming, opens a book, looks up a phone
     number and punches it into his phone.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (into the phone)
            This is Sam Albert. Put me through
            to Langley. Dick Marshal's office.

     INT. UNIVERSITY COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A place packed with STUDENTS, computers and TEACHERS.
     DEAN sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's
     really watching is--

     A WELL-DRESSED MAN at the counter, his back to DEAN,
     ordering a cup of coffee.

     The MAN glances at DEAN off the mirror behind the counter.

     BRILL walks in and joins DEAN.

                        BRILL
            Albert's primed. We'll let him stew
            for a day and then drop the tape.

     BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN.

                        DEAN
            He came in four minutes ago.

                        BRILL
               (pause)
            C'mon.

     They're about to start for the front door when an
     unmarked police car pulls up in front.

     A rowdy group of FRAT BOYS flood in, loud and busy. By
     the time they pass, BRILL and DEAN are gone.

     The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the
     back door swinging shut.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley
     and over a fence to another street. They slow as they
     approach the parked Taurus. BRILL takes the wheel with
     DEAN beside him.

     They pull into traffic. Things look good, but then the
     UNMARKED CAR and a SQUAD CAR scream up behind, lights
     flashing.

     INT. TAURUS - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes
     alive.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     A COP picks up the radio-mic.

                        COP
            One-Lincoln-Nine. In pursuit of two
            suspects, one matching description
            of Robert Dean, wanted in connection
            with a homicide. Suspects northbound
            on--

     EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS

     Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a
     one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar
     into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at
     his best, putting distance between himself and the cops
     at every turn.

     Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race
     down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.

     BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires
     smoking.

     Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing
     them in.

     BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end
     and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL
     gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and
     hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing
     wall.

                        BRILL
            Feeling lucky?

                        DEAN
            Not particularly, no.

     They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at
     the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the
     car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled
     with coal.

     They aren't going anywhere.

     Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.

     A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his
     gun and nears...

     Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam
     hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.

     DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He
     barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.

     His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,
     which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.

                        DEAN
            Shit.
               (to BRILL)
            I'm stuck. Help me out.

     He looks back to see that BRILL is hanging out the
     driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.

                        COP
               (on waist radio)
            One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA'd
            into a coal car at the Fullbright
            rail-yards. Requesting back-up,
            fire and ambulance.

     An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-
     yard and stops. The ROOKIE turns as JONES and KRUG hop out.

                        JONES
               (flashing ID)
            FBI. What do you got?

                        COP
            Two murder suspects. One's wounded,
            the other's maybe dead.

                        JONES
            Thank you.

     KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly
     shoots the COP dead.

                        JONES
               (to KRUG)
            Check inside.

     DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to
     dig himself out of the coal.

     KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of
     interest. JONES scans the area.

                        KRUG
               (to BRILL as he searches.)
            I hate doin' cops, I really do. You
            I won't mind. Didn't mind that
            Rachel Banks. Didn't mind doin' her
            one bit.
               (seeing DEAN's shoe)
            Your lawyer friend buried over there?

     BRILL can only gurgle blood. JONES pops the Taurus's
     trunk had looks inside.

     KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for
     Dean. Then BRILL sees him--

     BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car,
     lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG
     discovers he's not in the car.

     BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.

     JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the
     unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.

     KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches
     with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.

                        KRUG
            Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes.
            Find Dean.

     JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's
     cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.

     KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.

     Shit.

     BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes,
     consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown
     off his feet from the concussion.

                        JONES
               (scrambling away)
            Fuck--

     JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and
     tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach.

     DEAN watches from the shadows as flames incinerate
     everything.

                        MARSHAL (V.O.)
            I just came from my office at
            Langley. Senator Albert called me
            there.

     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. RESTAURANT TERRACE - DAY

     MARSHAL and SHAFFER dine with REYNOLDS at a restaurant
     overlooking the Potomac.

                        SHAFFER
            I got the same call at the Bureau.
            He's upset.

                        REYNOLDS
            About what?

                        MARSHAL
            About what? Do I look stupid?

                        REYNOLDS
            Ken--

                        MARSHAL
            Does Shaffer look stupid to you?

                        SHAFFER
            We're not stupid, Reynolds.

                        MARSHAL
            The fuck do you have goin' on with
            Sam Albert?

                        SHAFFER
            This guy's carrying the flag for
            the damn terrorism bill. You think
            this is the best time to piss him off?

                        MARSHAL
            You have any idea what kind of
            position this--

                        SHAFFER
            He's carrying the damn flag.

                        REYNOLDS
            We're not doing anything with Sam
            Albert.

                        MARSHAL
            He thinks we're stupid.

                        SHAFFER
            He found an NSA SAT tracker on his
            motor home today.

                        REYNOLDS
            It's not ours.

                        MARSHAL
            It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.

                        SHAFFER
            I don't know what's going on, but
            if you people have tripped over
            your own asshole again, you're not
            gonna get any help from us. It's
            ending at your doorstep.

                        HICKS (V.O.)
            Brill's dead.

     INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

     REYNOLDS rides in the back of the car, a cellular to
     his ear.

                        REYNOLDS
            What about--

                        HICKS (O.S.)
            We don't know.

                        REYNOLDS
            Explain that.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. TECH ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The room is crammed with people as HICKS talks over the
     phone.

                        HICKS
            Jones had to flee the scene before
            we could locate the second body.

                        REYNOLDS
            What about the tape?

                        HICKS
            We think it was on Brill. If it was,
            it's destroyed now.

                        REYNOLDS
            And if it wasn't?

     ORGAN MUSIC can be heard as REYNOLDS snaps his phone shut.

                        PRIEST (O.S.)
            Peace be with you.

     EXT. SAINT PAUL'S CHURCH - DAY

     Establishing. A beautiful church in an expensive
     neighborhood.

                        CHORUS OF PARISHIONERS (O.S.)
            And also with you.

     INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

     A crowded Catholic mass. The PRIEST delivers a sermon
     from an altar decorated with Christmas candles and
     evergreen.

                        PRIEST
            The Lord said: I leave you peace,
            my peace I leave you. Let us now,
            in the spirit of these holidays,
            turn to our neighbors and offer
            them a sign of peace.

     REYNOLDS stands in a pew beside his TWO DAUGHTERS and
     his WIFE. He turns to those immediately around him,
     shaking their hands.

                        REYNOLDS
            Peace be with you...Peace be with you.

     A disguised DEAN takes REYNOLDS hand and shakes it...


                        DEAN
            Merry Christmas. It's me.

                        REYNOLDS
            Do I know you?

                        DEAN
            I'm Robert Dean. Within twelve
            hours, you're gonna be in jail.
            Peace be with you.

     REYNOLDS is dumbstruck...

                        PRIEST
            Let us now offer up thanks to the
            Lord our God in the words our
            Father gave us.

                        CONGREGATION

            Robert, is it safe to be talking on
            the phone like this?

     INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     DEAN sits on a bed while talking into a modified
     cellular computer. The screen shows his current call
     signal re-routing between relay stations.

                        DEAN
               (into phone)
            I've re-routed the call. They can't
            trace it.

            Yeah.

     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE ON A SMALL GRAY CONE-SHAPED MICROWAVE ANTENNA

                        STACY (O.S.)
            They're saying you killed that
            policeman.

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            That's gonna end tonight.

     EXT. EXPRESSWAY - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE ON A MICROWAVE TOWER WITH NINE GRAY CONES
     pointing nine directions. The intercepted phone signals
     being relayed.

                        STACY (O.S.)
            Where are you?

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            I can't tell you that.

     EXT. KENT ISLAND - CONTINUOUS

     Re-establishing. A concrete building rising from the woods.

                        STACY (O.S.)
            Can you tell me anything?

     INT. CEMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREENS showing hundreds of phone
     numbers scrolling by. A massive vacume cleaner of every
     cellular call being made in the state of Maryland. The
     computer scans for trigger numbers or words.

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            I can tell you this: That anti-
            terrorism bill you were so worked
            up about? I don't think it's gonna
            pass.

     A phone number locks on the screen--

                        TECHNICIAN
            Got it!

     INT. REYNOLDS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The phone on the nightstand begins to RING. REYNOLDS
     wakes as his wife rolls to the other side of the bed.
     He grabs his scrambler phone and goes into--

     INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

     REYNOLDS closes the door and waits as scrambled lines
     connect. Finally, a confirming tone.

                        REYNOLDS
            Yeah.

     INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

     HICKS is on the phone.

                        HICKS
            Found him. Kent Island nailed the
            call five minutes ago. He's stationary.

                        REYNOLDS
            Do you have visual?

                        HICKS
            Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th.
            I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene
            now. A residential building. Twelve
            units.

                        REYNOLDS
            What's your ETA?

                        HICKS
            Three minutes. We're going in light.
            Myself and two others. Everyone
            else is held back in reserve.

                        REYNOLDS
            He walked right up to me in church.
            At the holiest time of the wear. He
            approached me in a sanctified place.
               (beat)
            Kill him now.

     EXT. A VICTORIAN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     Establishing. Peaceful street, quaint apartments. THREE
     MEN stroll to the entrance of a well-maintained
     building. One jimmies the lock and a moment later
     they're in.

     INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     HICKS, JONES and DAVIS prepare. All have miniature
     earphones. DAVIS checks his silenced pistol. HICKS
     activates a frequency locator. The needle snaps on. He
     looks at DAVIS and JONES.

     They're ready.

     All hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the
     staircase.

     One flight, two. Then HICKS stops. The needle says
     they're close.

     HICKS motions. Their target's on two. They move down
     the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a TV
     SHOW drifting from an apartment.  Someone's up at this
     hour.

     They move on. HICKS watches the needle as it moves. He
     motions DAVIS and JONES to a door. JONES puts a
     reverse-viewer against the peep-hole.

     JONES's POV: A view of an entryway and living room. A
     light bleeds from an O.S. source. Beyond that there's
     no sign of life.

     HICKS puts a contact-mic against the door and listens
     to FAINT CONVERSATION somewhere inside, possibly the
     phone call. HICKS nods to JONES who quickly picks the
     lock while DAVIS eyes the hall.

     After a nervous moment, the door opens and HICKS, JONES
     and DAVIS enter.

     INT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     They spread out, searching the well-decorated condo for
     the target.

     They near the room with light. Using a mini-mirror,
     HICKS looks around the bend to see--

     A BEDROOM. There's a briefcase on the bed.

     They enter.

     From the bathroom they hear sounds of RUNNING WATER.
     They slowly approach. Wood again CREAKS beneath them.

     DEAN's VOICE is heard through the locked door.

     HICKS signals "on three".

     He counts, and they SMASH the door open to see--

     --a cellular phone taped to a Baby-Monitor. DEAN's
     nowhere in sight.

                        HICKS
            The fuck is this?

     INT. POLICE STATION/DISPATCH AREA - NIGHT

     Spinning banks of reporters manned by POLICE DISPATCHERS.
     We move to one desk where a phone rings.

     An LED immediately displays the caller's name; KRUGER,
     JACK, along with his social-security number and date of
     birth.

                        DISPATCHER
            Nine-one-one emergency.

                        OLD MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            My name's Jack Kreuger, I'm at 1102
            Grambling. I just saw three guys
            break into the condo next door. It
            looked to me like they had guns.

     INT. VICTORIAN BUILDING'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN has the phone circuit box open and is plugged in
     with a phone-line. Over the phone's mouthpiece, he
     holds an electronic Voice-Mask which alters his voice
     into an old man's.

                        DISPATCHER (O.S.)
            We'll send a unit over there now.
            If it's safe, sir, we'd like you to
            stay by your phone.

                        DEAN
            Yeah, I think I'll stay where I am.

            Three suspects now inside. 1102
            Grambling, apartment 302.

            Shit.

            201 to First Team. Pull out. We got
            the cops.

     INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     HICKS spins and heads for the door. DAVIS hits it first.
     He grabs the doorknob and pulls--

     --and the knob rips from the door, trailing small wires.

                        DAVIS
            Fuck me!

                        JONES
            What'd you do?

                        DAVIS
            It came off in my hand!

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

     TWO SQUAD CARS come rolling up and FOUR COPS get out
     and head into the building.

     INT. THE APARTMENT

     JONES is trying to pry the door open with his fingers.
     No use.

                        TECHNICIAN
               (over radio)
            Get outa there, guys!

     While JONES continues on the door, DAVIS runs to the
     window.

     Throughout this, HICKS will stand in the middle of the
     room and, simply, oddly, stare at the mantle over the
     fireplace.

                        DAVIS
            Goddamit!

     HICKS smiles...and now he starts laughing a little...

                        JONES
            What's so fuckin' funny?

     HICKS motions to a framed picture over the fireplace.

                        HICKS
            It's over. We've been fucked with
            our pants on.

     The framed picture is of Senator SAM ALBERT and CHRISTA
     HAWKINS.

                        HICKS (CONT'D)
            We broke into her condo.

     DOOR WOOD EXPLODES inward. The TWO COPS roll in
     crouched positions, weapons drawn.

                        COP #1
            POLICE! FREEZE!

     HICKS doesn't move, DAVIS freezes like a deer in
     headlights, JONES stares with cold, dead eyes.

                        COP #2
            DROP THE WEAPONS! NOW!

     Two more COPS arrive. JONES and DAVIS drop their guns.

                        COP #1
            ON THE GROUND! NOW! FACE THE FLOOR!

     They do so. COPS THREE and FOUR go room to room making
     sure no one else is lurking. In the bedroom, they find
     the briefcase. Inside the briefcase--

     --listening bugs, installation equipment and
     compromising photos of the Senator with Christa.

                        CHRISTA (O.S.)
            Oh my God! What's going on?!

     Back in the living room, CHRISTA has walked through the
     broken-in apartment door to see JONES, HICKS and DAVIS
     lying on the floor at gun point.

                        COP #2
            Ma'am, is this your apartment?

                        CHRISTA
            What happened?!

                        COP #1
            Would you step out in the hallway
            for a moment, ma'am.

                        CHRISTA
            Oh God.

                        COP #2
            Please. We'll be right with you.

     CHRISTA backs slowly out of the apartment and into--

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     CHRISTA holds her hand over her mouth and is shaking. A
     VOICE comes from an alcove...

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Christa?

     She turns. DEAN steps out from the alcove.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            You got a second?

                        CHRISTA
            Who are you?

                        DEAN
            My name's Robert Dean.

     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET IN CHEVY CHASE - NIGHT

     An up-scale neighborhood. Two inexpensive cars that
     don't seem to belong there sit in front of a large home.

     INT. SENATOR ALBERT'S PRIVATE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN sits with a drink in his hand. Across from him are
     CHRISTA and PATRICK.

     They sit in uncomfortable silence for a moment before
     SENATOR ALBERT enters in bathrobe and pajamas.

                        ALBERT
            I understand we have a problem.

                        PATRICK
            Senator--

                        CHRISTA
            Senator, there were some things I
            couldn't tell you over the phone.

                        ALBERT
            What kinds of things?

                        PATRICK
            Mr. Dean has a video tape from the
            hotel room in Boston.

                        ALBERT
               (pause)
            I see.

                        DEAN
            It's actually DH-1 Digitech
            Pinpoint scanning with a frequency
            modulator.

                        ALBERT
            I don't know what that means.

                        DEAN
            Me neither, but the upshot is I've
            got color live-action footage of
            you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't
            look good.

                        ALBERT
            So...how much money do you want in
            exchange for not ruining my life?

                        DEAN
            I don't want any money. And believe
            me, I have no interest in ruining
            your life. I'm not interested in
            this tape.

                        ALBERT
            You're not.

                        PATRICK
            Then what do you want from the Senator?

                        DEAN
            I want him to look at a different
            tape. People have been killed.
            Lives have been ruined.
               (DEAN takes the computer
                chip from his pocket)
            Senator, I want you to look at this.
            And I want you to bring the fury of
            God himself upon this man.

     DEAN tosses the chip to ALBERT.

     INT. REYNOLDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

     REYNOLDS is asleep when the PHONE wakes him up. Once
     again, he reaches for his scrambled phone heads into
     the bathroom.

     After waiting for the signal that the line's clear...

                        REYNOLDS
            Yeah.

                        TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
            Sir, we've just intercepted an FBI
            communication.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            Well...what is it?

                        TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
            Well, sir, it seems there's a
            warrant out on--

     The DOORBELL rings. REYNOLDS is alarmed.

     Now there's BANGING at the door and DOORBELL RINGS again.

                        REYNOLDS WIFE (O.S.)
               (from the bedroom)
            Who is that, dear?

     REYNOLDS snaps the phone shut and goes downstairs to
     the door.

     When he opens the door he sees TWO FBI AGENTS with
     their ID's flapped open and six uniformed POLICEMEN
     backing them up.

                        FBI AGENT
            John Reynolds?

                        REYNOLDS
            What the hell--

                        FBI AGENT
            You're under arrest. You have the
            right to remain silent. Anything
            you say--

                        REYNOLDS WIFE (O.S.)
               (from upstairs)
            Honey...?

     INT. DEAN'S STREET - MORNING

     A PAPERBOY tosses a newspaper at the Dean's door.

                        SENATOR ALBERT (O.S.)
            Privacy and the right to privacy is
            an inalienable right.

     INT. DEAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Stacy has C-SPAN on the TV while she makes breakfast
     for ERIC. SENATOR ALBERT is addressing the SENATE.

                        ERIC
            These guys are always making speeches.

                        STACY
            It's an important speech, Eric.
            There's gonna be a vote today.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (on TV)
            Today we face a threat to that
            creed. Certain individuals in our
            intelligence community believe
            they're entitled to examine lives
            in minute detail, and claim to do
            it in the name of the common good.

                        ERIC
            If they're voting today, hasn't
            everyone pretty much made up their
            minds.

                        STACY
            Actually, this man appears to have
            changed his mind dramatically.

                        ERIC
            Why?

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            He saw the light, my son.

     ERIC and STACY whip around--

                        ERIC
            Dad!

     STACY and ERIC run to DEAN...

                        STACY
            Is it over?

                        DEAN
            It's over.

                        ERIC
            How long can you stay?

                        DEAN
            I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I
            live here.

     ERIC and DEAN hug.

                        STACY
            Get ready for school, you're gonna
            be late.

                        ERIC
            Is it okay to use the phone now?

                        DEAN
            It's okay to use the phone.

                        ERIC
            Alright!

                        DEAN
            No "900" numbers.

     But ERIC has disappeared up the stairs...

                        STACY
            It's really over?

                        DEAN
            Albert's gonna get me my job back.

                        STACY
               (pause)
            I'm sorry about Rachel.

                        DEAN
            Yeah.
               (beat)
            I wish you could've met...

                        STACY
            Who?

                        DEAN
            A friend of mine. I don't know his
            real name. He's dead now.

                        STACY
            You did good.

     STACY points to the TV and DEAN watches for a moment...

                        ALBERT
               (on TV)
            I've lived through the dark ages of
            Hoover's Watch-List and McCarthy's
            Witch Hunts - men who used moral
            crusades, fired by fear, to lay
            waste to our freedoms.

                        STACY
            C'mon upstairs. I've got a
            Christmas present from Harrison's I
            want to show you.

     DEAN arrives as STACY takes him by the arm. They head
     upstairs as ALBERT continues on...

                        ALBERT
               (on TV)
            Our intelligence communities
            presently monitor our phones,
            computers, financial transactions,
            medical histories...all this and
            more. Some of you may say, "Fine.
            I'm not a criminal and I have
            nothing to hide." Well God forbid
            we ever edge to tyranny. God forbid
            George Orwell's version of America
            becomes a reality. We are that close.

     ALBERT's speech continues as we...

     ROLL END CREDITS.








     FADE TO BLACK.
ENEMY OF THE STATE

                       David Marconi
                            and
                        Aaron Sorkin





















                                           February 10, 1997






     FADE IN:

     EXT. SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK, SCENIC VIEW LOT - MORNING

     Shenandoah mountains. A cold dawn. TWO BLACK TOWN CARS
     sit side by side, facing a view of a farming valley below.

     Two MEN in dark suits and long coats stand near the
     cars, casually on the lookout. If we caught a glimpse
     underneath the coat of the taller of the two, we'd see
     that he was carrying a 9mm. Glock.

     INT. BLACK TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

     In the backseat of the car sit HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS,
     each well-kept and in his early 50's.

                        REYNOLDS
            "I know thy works and thy labour
            and how thou canst not bear them
            that are evil. And thou hast tried
            them who say they are apostles and
            hast found them to be liars".
            Revelations II.

                        HAMERSLEY
            What the hell does it mean?

                        REYNOLDS
            It means who's side are you on?

                        HAMERSLEY
            You didn't ask me to meet you 30
            miles from my office for a Bible
            study class.

                        REYNOLDS
            It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone
            needs to swallow hard. No one,
            including you, wants to be fingered
            as the one obstructing efforts to
            crack down on terrorism, and--

                        HAMERSLEY
            Fuck you.

                        REYNOLDS
            What?

                        HAMERSLEY
            I said fuck you.

                        REYNOLDS
            Is that anyway to talk to an old
            school chum?

                        HAMERSLEY
            You're gonna finger me as soft on
            terrorism? Terrorism, you
            unconscionable asshole?

                        REYNOLDS
            There are planes falling out of the
            sky, buildings blowing up. American
            buildings. Americans getting bombs
            in the mail. What are we gonna do!?

                        HAMERSLEY
            We're not gonna hand you and your
            band of lunatics the keys to the
            kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in
            Congress and write a law that
            allows the NSA to point a camera
            and a microphone at anything they
            damn well feel like. And the next
            time you have something to say to
            me, we do it above-board, in my
            office, like everyone else. Now get
            outa my car, I've got a committee
            meeting on the hill.

     REYNOLDS regards HAMERSLEY a moment, then opens the car
     door--

     EXT. PARKWAY - MORNING

     HAMERSLEY's car snakes down the twisting mountain road.

     INT. HAMERSLEY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

     HAMERSLEY MAKES VERBAL NOTES concerning the Reynolds
     meeting into his memo-recorder as he drives. He picks
     up his cellular phone and punches in a number.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Senator Albert's office--

     The line goes dead.

     HAMERSLEY tries again but can't get a dial tone. Then,
     in the rear-view mirror, a BROWN SEDAN gains fast.
     Whoever the guy is, he's flying. Then a man with a
     rifle leans out the sedan's window. Aims.

     HAMERSLEY flies into a blind curve. Tires SCREECH as he
     rounds the bend to see

     A PROPANE TRUCK. Blocking both lanes of the road.

     HAMERSLEY's eyes widen. He stomps the brakes, SKIDS and
     SLAMS into the truck. The EXPLOSION engulfs everything.
     HAMERSLEY and the car are consumed. The pursuing sedan
     slows to a stop. The men watch. The car's an inferno.

     The MEN pull a 'U' and drive away.

     INT. CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA, TALL OFFICE BLDG. - DAY

     A well-appointed big-city law office filled with
     citations of merit and pictures of a wife and child.

     ROBERT DEAN, a likable young lawyer, sits behind his
     desk with his back to an OLDER MAN. He stares at a
     commanding view of Washington, D.C. as he listens to a
     tired, smoke and whiskey voice.

                        OLDER MAN (L.T.)
            I don't know how much longer we can
            hold out, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            I don't know, either, L.T. Maybe
            you guys should get yourself a
            labor lawyer.

                        L.T.
            Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean.
            'Cause you're a labor lawyer.

                        DEAN
            Good point.

                        L.T.
            Last night, Larry Spinks, he works
            the Steel Press, he goes to a bar
            with his wife Rosalie to have a
            glass of chianti 'cause it's his
            birthday, and these two guys, these
            Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him
            when he goes to the bathroom.

                        DEAN
            L.T., in this office I'd prefer you
            say Italian-Americans.

                        L.T.
            I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in
            St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm
            not myself. The Union bosses say
            unless we take Bellmoth's offer,
            it'll only get worse.

                        DEAN
            That's because your Union bosses
            are those Guido mother-fuckers.

                        L.T.
            I don't under--

                        DEAN
            The Union's trying to railroad you
            into accepting terms worse than
            what you have now.

                        L.T.
            Why would the Union--

     DEAN swivels around in his chair and faces L.T.

                        DEAN
            Because they've been paid off by
            Bellmoth.

                        L.T.
            Mr. Dean--

                        DEAN
            My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer.
            Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.

     DEAN gets up and walks a grateful L.T. to the door,
     calling to his secretary as they go--

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
               (calling)
            Martha!

     MARTHA appears in the doorway...

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            Larry Spinks, St. Lukes. Send him a
            case of chianti from the firm. And
            send his wife Rosalie some flowers.

     EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

                        RACHEL
            How's the trout?

                        DEAN
            It tastes like fish.

                        RACHEL
            It is fish.

                        DEAN
            I mean it tastes like every other
            fish I've ever had. Every fish
            tastes the same.

                        RACHEL
            Do you like fish?

                        DEAN
            Not that much.

     DEAN dines in a booth with RACHEL BANKS, 30's. RACHEL
     opens her briefcase, removing an 8x10 envelope.

                        RACHEL
            Here's what you asked for. Brill's
            note said it was everything you'd
            need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--

                        DEAN
            When do I get to meet him?

                        RACHEL
            DePinto?

                        DEAN
            Brill.

                        RACHEL
            Never.

                        DEAN
            That wasn't the answer I was hoping
            for.

                        RACHEL
            What answer were you--

     DEAN is reaching inside his jacket pocket. He removes
     an envelope marked "BRILL".

                        DEAN
            "Soon". Or at least sooner than never.

                        RACHEL
            It's how he works.

                        DEAN
            Brill?

                        RACHEL
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            So you've said.

     DEAN hands her the envelope.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            Ten thousand cash. I don't know if
            it's Brill's prices going up or
            your commission.

                        RACHEL
            I take a straight 15 percent.
            Brill's fee varies with risk.
            Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
            using someone else.

                        DEAN
            Other than Brill.

                        RACHEL
            Other than me.

                        DEAN
            Why would I--

                        RACHEL
            Someone with whom you don't have

            I like our history. And I like you.

            I just want to make sure I'm not
            breaking the law.

                        RACHEL
            You're not.

                        DEAN
            How can I be sure.

                        RACHEL
            I wouldn't let you. Good luck with

            What can I do for you?

                        DEAN
            Well, I was hoping you might stop
            by my office to swear out a
            criminal deposition against some of
            your friends and co-workers.

                        DEPINTO
               (pause)
            Is this a fuckin' joke?

                        DEAN
            I don't believe it is, no.

                        DEPINTO
            Why the hell would I--

                        DEAN
            I've got photographs of you at the

                        DEPINTO
            That ain't me.

            It's not?

            You don't know who the fuck--

                        DEAN
            That's not you having a whiskey
            sour with Carmine Morada.

                        DEPINTO
            This is fucked. You don't know
            who's in that--

                        DEAN
            You're right, Mr. DePinto, and
            maybe I jumped the gun.

                        DEPINTO
            You're goddam right you jumped the gun.

                        DEAN
            That's probably not you in the
            picture. I tell you what, I'll just
            run the thing by the Grand Jury,
            see if they can't--

                        DEPINTO
            I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.

     News helicopters hover over Hamersley's wreck as police
     direct traffic around the media circus.

     INT. OLD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     DAN ZAVITZ, looks older than he is, balding with a
     weight problem, sweats behind SLAPPING wipers of a
     beater car plastered with environmental issue stickers.
     NPR drones on the radio as a police car crawls behind
     him, SIREN YELPING, lights flashing, trying to get by.

                        ZAVITZ
            Alright, alright already, I see you.

     ZAVITZ POV: Wreckage surrounded by squad cars,
     ambulances and media circus. Something's happened.
     Something big.

     EXT. SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK - DAY

     A tall ladder leans against a dead oak. ZAVITZ sweats
     and climbs to a branch where a platform's been built
     supporting a large phony bird's nest. He lifts away the
     nest, revealing--

     --Two microphones and three motion-activated digital
     video cameras and recorders. ZAVITZ checks the cameras'
     viewfinders to see--

     --TIME-CODED VIEWS - WIDE, MEDIUM AND CLOSE of a
     squirrel's nest containing three newborns. The parents
     are nowhere to be seen.

     ZAVITZ eyes the recorders. The video disks are spent.
     He ejects and pockets them, replacing them with fresh ones.

     INT. ZAVITZ APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     ZAVITZ is staring intently at his computer monitor. We
     don't know yet what he's looking at, but he's scared to
     death as we continue to listen to the NEWS REPORT...

            Don Hamersley, senior GOP
            congressional leader, was serving
            as a negotiator on the House/Senate
            sub-committee studying the Anti-
            Terror Bill...

     ZAVITZ leans in a little closer to get a better look at
     his computer screen, not wanting to believe what he's
     seeing...

                        NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) (O.S.)
            ...the controversial legislation
            that would give various law
            enforcement agencies expanded
            authority in the fight against
            terrorism.

     And now we see what ZAVITZ is staring at on his
     computer monitor. The film he shot at SHENANDOAH PARK...

     ...the meeting between HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS.

                        NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) (O.S.)
            Known as the Voice of Caution,
            Hamersley was an outspoken advocate
            of...

     ZAVITZ reaches over, picks up the phone, and punches in
     some numbers with one hand. With the other, he punches
     some keystrokes on the computer. The screen zooms in on
     REYNOLDS, getting out of HAMERSLEY's car.

                        NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) (O.S.)
            Sixty-eight years old, Hamersley
            leaves behind a wife and four children.

               (into phone)
            Tell him it's Zavitz. I need to
            speak to him. Tell him it's important.

                        ALFONSO
            Lemme ask you something. I put a

            Turn on CNN.

                        ALFONSO
            They keep taking the bird seed. I

     ALFONSO clicks his TV to CNN. The HAMERSLEY re-cap is

            Once again, police at this point
            are calling Hamersley's death an
            accident...

                        ZAVITZ
            I was doing motion-activated taping
            up in Shenandoah. That's where
            Hamersley had his accident. He
            wasn't alone. He met someone. They
            argued.

                        ALFONSO
            You've got it on tape?

     ...and inserts it into a Gameboy.

     He steps to the door and eyes the peep-hole.

            All right. Okay. Just give me a minute.

     ZAVITZ POV: TWO DWP INSTALLERS hovering in a bucket
     across the street. Down below, a cargo van with a
     multiple roof antenna is double parked near a Fed-Ex
     van. Then--

     --Through a street window's reflection, ZAVITZ sees his
     building's front entrance. SEVERAL TENANTS are being
     prevented from entering by TWO MEN, plain clothes, one
     with a radio communicator pressed to his ear.

     Shit.

     ZAVITZ backs from the window, seized by panic. He grabs
     his phone...

     ...dead.

     He picks up his fax line. Also dead.

     He grabs the GameBoy, goes to a small side window and
     opens it. A ledge snakes around the corner. An athlete
     he's not but there's no choice. He squeezes out.

     PRATT sprints down the hall, pulling out his pistol, as

     JONES kicks in Zavitz's door and rushes in. The
     window's open. JONES looks out as the last of ZAVITZ
     goes around the corner of the ledge.

               (into headset)
            We'll take delivery from here.

     ZAVITZ inches along, scared breathless. He looks back.

     No one.

     Maybe he was wrong.

     A pigeon suddenly flies by...ZAVITZ loses his balance,
     struggles...and falls.

     He crashes through an awning and into a sidewalk fruit
     stand.

     Dazed, ZAVITZ crawls to his feet as passersby watch
     speechless.

     Things happen fast. The cargo van rips from the curb
     but is suddenly blocked by a delivery truck. HORNS BLAST.

     HICKS, 30's and athletic, leaps from the van.

     Fears confirmed, ZAVITZ starts down the sidewalk,
     shakes off pain, and moves to a run.

     Except now there's someone in front of him. He's
     trapped. Reaching a doorway, ZAVITZ pushes. The door

     A garbage truck screams up the alley. There's no way to
     outrun it. There's a fire escape above a dumpster.
     Breath rasping, he struggles on the dumpster, pulling
     himself up the ladder just as the truck OBLITERATES all
     below.

     ZAVITZ struggles and climbs. Reaching a landing, he
     pauses for breath...

     He flies past the diners and exits into--

     EXT. BUSY STREET - CONTINUOUS

     HICKS and ANOTHER fly out of the diner, just in time to
     see ZAVITZ melting in with Christmas shoppers that are
     entering a department store.

     We see that the large sign over the entrance to the
     store reads: "HARRISON'S".

     INT. HARRISON'S DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

     An upscale store packed with Christmas shoppers.

     At a fashion ramp, a small crowd of mostly WOMEN have
     gathered to watch leggy models feature a particular
     line of lingerie. Mixed in among this group is DEAN, a
     shopping bag in each hand, his briefcase tucked under
     one arm, trying his best to affect an air of the
     studious shopper.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            May I help you?

                        DEAN
               (startled)
            Hm?!

     The WOMAN is sales clerk who's been in this situation
     before.

                        SALES CLERK
            Do you see anything you like?

                        DEAN
            I'm married.

                        SALES CLERK
            That's fine.

                        DEAN
            I'm married to my wife...of several
            years...and I'd like to buy...as a
            Christmas present...

                        SALES CLERK
            You'd like to buy your wife some
            lingerie as a Christmas gift.

                        DEAN
            Yes. I have her permission.

                        SALES CLERK
            It's okay. I think it's a wonderful
            gift.

                        DEAN
            Can you help me?

                        SALES CLERK
            How 'bout Christian Dior?

                        DEAN
            Is that good?

                        SALES CLERK
            Very good.

                        DEAN
            I don't know anything about this.
            Well, I mean, I know a little
            about--from a certain perspective.
            My point is, I don't want to do
            anything foolish.

                        SALES CLERK
            It's a little late for that.

                        DEAN
            I'll say.

                        SALES CLERK
            What size?

                        DEAN
            Pardon?

                        SALES CLERK
            What size?

                        DEAN
            Eight.  Size eight.

                        SALES CLERK
            I'll be right back.

                        DEAN
            Thanks.

                        SALES CLERK
            Remain calm.

                        DEAN
            Okay.

     The SALES CLERK goes around the counter to the rear
     area. DEAN glances at the fashion show when he glimpses--

     ZAVITZ, hurrying through the women's dressing area,
     desperately looking for an exit. No luck. ZAVITZ moves
     toward DEAN, about to break for the front, but HICKS is
     there searching. Trapped, ZAVITZ ducks behind a display.

     DEAN watches, unaware of ZAVITZ's pursuers. Then it
     clicks...

                        DEAN
            Daniel?

     ZAVITZ turns, frightened....

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            It's me, Robert Dean.
               (beat)
            From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--

                        ZAVITZ
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            It's been a few years.

                        ZAVITZ
            Yeah.

                        DEAN
            I'm just doing some Christmas
            shopping. It's for my wife, no
            kidding. Though, this isn't the
            main present, it's just, you know,
            a little--

                        ZAVITZ
            I need help.

                        DEAN
            Tell me about it.

                        ZAVITZ
            How can I reach you?

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Are you okay?

                        ZAVITZ
            Are you still in Crystal City?

                        DEAN
            Yeah, what's going on?

                        SALES CLERK (O.S.)
            I think she'll like this very much.

                        DEAN
            Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.

                        SALES CLERK
            For that matter, I think you will too.

                        DEAN
               (to the SALES CLERK)
            Could you give me just a moment to
            talk to a friend of mine here? Not
            about this, but...Daniel?

     DEAN looks around...

     ...ZAVITZ is gone.

     EXT. HARRISON'S DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

     Out on the street, ZAVITZ shoves into a group of
     shoppers waiting for the light. Then he sees HICKS and
     his PARTNER. They see him.

     Fuck the light.

     ZAVITZ runs into the street as--

     --a BUS speeds through yellow. ZAVITZ is caught in its
     path.

     BAM!

     Only stunned witnesses remain.

     DEAN exits the department store. He sees the commotion
     and makes his way over.

                        DEAN
               (to a bystander)
            What happened?

                        BYSTANDER
            A guy got hit by a bus.

                        DEAN
            Ah, Jesus.

     SIRENS can be heard in the distance. DEAN eyes the
     ground where the body lays. He sees Zavitz's BLOODY
     JACKET...

                        DEAN
               (quietly)
            Ah...Jesus.

     EXT. ANNAPOLIS - NIGHT

     DEAN's BMW drives through a neighborhood of stately

     INT. DEAN'S BMW - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN drives, a little shaken by events. The RADIO plays
     an AT&T COMMERCIAL relaying the joys of home tele-
     conferencing. DEAN enters the driveway of his picture-
     perfect home.

     INT. DEAN'S HOME/FOYER - NIGHT

     DEAN enters with his shopping bags and briefcase.
     Searching for family members, he enters--

     INT. DEAN'S HOME/DEN - NIGHT

     DEAN's 8 year old son, ERIC and Eric's friend DYLAN sit
     by the big-screen TV, glued to a video game. A NANNY is
     nearby, lost in a magazine.

                        DEAN
            Excuse me, have any of you seen an
            eight year old boy, good looking,
            about yea-big.

                        ERIC
            Hi, dad.

                        DYLAN
            Hi, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            Hello. Hello, Maria.

                        NANNY (MARIA)
            Hello, Mr. Dean.

                        ERIC
            We can't get to the fourth level.
            We keep getting vaporized by the
            Black Knight.

                        DEAN
            You're learning a cruel lesson.

                        ERIC
            Are those my Christmas presents?

                        DEAN
            Some of 'em.

                        ERIC
            Can I open 'em up?

                        DEAN
            Sure, go ahead.

                        ERIC
            Really?

                        DEAN
            In your dreams.

                        ERIC
            Dad!

                        DEAN
               (to DYLAN)
            You staying for dinner?

                        DYLAN
            Is it okay?

                        DEAN
            You got any money?

                        ERIC
            He's kidding.

                        DEAN
            Where's mom?

                        ERIC
            She's in the kitchen.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     The kitchen is in the midst of a remodel. A wall-
     mounted TV is showing "CROSSFIRE", where the two HOSTS
     are mediating a battle between TWO SENATORS.

     STACY watches the show with one eye, cooks with the other.

                        SENATOR TASKEN (TV)
            Laws service society and they need
            to be flexible to meet changing
            demands. We've got to be able to
            deal with a terrorist threat before
            it occurs.

     DEAN enters...

                        DEAN
            Hey.

                        STACY
            This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.

                        DEAN
            Uh-oh.

                        STACY
            Listen to him.

                        SENATOR TASKEN (TV)
            This is no longer a theoretical
            problem, it's a reality. Turn on
            the news. Bombings, hostages--

                        DEAN
            He's got a point.

                        STACY
            Bobby!

                        DEAN
            Not a very good one, but--

                        STACY
            So you tap everyone's phone? You
            use computers to probe financial
            records? New Search and Seizure laws?

                        DEAN
            Just for the criminals.

                        STACY
            We won't suspend the civil rights
            of the good people.

                        DEAN
            Right.

                        STACY
            You should take this seriously.

                        DEAN
            I think you're taking it seriously
            enough for both of us.

     He kisses her. A good one.

                        STACY
               (softer)
            You're a lawyer. Don't you care
            what's going on around you?

                        DEAN
            Something bad happened tonight.

                        STACY
            What?

                        DEAN
            I saw a man die.

                        STACY
            What do you mean?

                        DEAN
            In front of Harrison's, he got hit
            by a bus. I knew him. The firm did
            some pro bono work for his
            organization a few years back.

                        STACY
               (beat)
            I'm sorry.

                        DEAN
            The thing is, when I saw him, it
            seemed like he wanted to tell me...
               (beat)
            ...he was upset about something and
            he said...
               (beat)
            Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.

                        STACY
            What'd you buy at Harrison's?

                        DEAN
            A toaster. And no terrorist talk at
            dinner. You're spookin' the kids.

     DEAN heads upstairs...

                  NUMBERS DON'T LIE - PEOPLE DO

     She enters a phone number in her terminal. The computer
     DIALS. She waits, snacking on rice cakes. Finally,
     another computer ANSWERS. On screen appears: PAC-TEL
     TESTING BOARD. The screen fills with choices. She
     highlights -

                  AT&T LINE-VERIFICATION REQUEST
                        LOG-IN ACCESS CODE

     She enters another command. A new prompt reads: ENTER
     LINE REQUEST NUMBER.

     Eyeing DEAN's folder, she enters the phone number and
     commands "ENTER". "RECORD".

     The telephone tap is instant.

     A VOICE GRAPH appears in-sync with CONVERSATION now
     coming over the speakers.

                        DEAN (O.S.)
               (mid-conversation, over speakers)
            Diane's instinct is that it's sabre
            rattling. I think they're gonna
            file suit.

     She enters more commands. An Automated-Voice-Transcriber
     kicks in. DEAN's CONVERSATION is now transcribed
     automatically.

     INT. NRO, KEYHOLE-12 LAB - CONTINUOUS

     A massive, dark place growing with monitors and tech.

     SUPER: NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE ORGANIZATION, CHANTILLY,
            VIRGINIA

     Names of world regions are posted above endless monitor
     screens displaying live, digital-image feeds of Earth
     coming in from the Keyhole-12 Spy Satellites. Every
     populated area of the planet is covered here. ANALYSTS
     attend the many feeds.

     A poster reads:

                     THE KEYHOLE '12' SERIES
                 MAKING THE WORLD AN HONEST PLACE

     On another poster, a man's running shadow in a target
     bulls-eye with a caption reading:

                    YOU ARE A SECURITY TARGET

     Beneath a sign reading U.S. North-East Coastal Region,
     an ANALYST reviews time-coded, digital SAT videos of
     Washington, D.C. As seen from space, the Capitol
     appears to be nothing more than a greyish mass. The
     ANALYST keys commands into his system.

     CLOSE ON MONITOR - The overhead SAT view of Washington
     moves in closer, soon streets are discernible, then
     cars and buses - then an accident in an intersection
     with flashing ambulance lights and a bus. A body lies
     twisted in the street - it's ZAVITZ.

     The ANALYST enters additional commands. The ZAVITZ/bus
     accident freezes, then plays in reverse as if recorded
     by the eye of God.  The scene continues reversing,
     following close on Zavitz as he back-tracks into
     Harrison's Department Store.

     INT. ANOTHER VIDEO LAB - SAME TIME

     CLOSE ON ANOTHER ANALYST facing three monitors showing
     additional views of ZAVITZ's escape as captured by a
     traffic camera, an ATM camera and the security inside
     Harrison's.

                        FIEDLER (O.S.)
            We've checked everything. NRO tapes,
            traffic surveillance monitors -

     INT. IMAGE ENHANCEMENT LAB

     TWO TECHIES huddle by a monitor overseen by FIEDLER, a
     computer expert. The monitor displays the Harrison's
     surveillance tape of the ZAVITZ/DEAN meeting.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            - and two ATM cameras. The one
            showing promise, though, is this
            security camera from the department
            store.
               (to TECHIE)
            Freeze there.

     The TECHIE hits a command. ZAVITZ and DEAN freeze on
     screen.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Times ten.

     The TECHIE boxes the area to be enhanced. He types
     commands. The boxed area increases ten-fold.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Focus on the drop.

     The enlarged view shifts to DEAN's gift bags. The
     picture's fuzzy. Someone passes by, blocking the view
     at a crucial moment.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Enhance, then forward, frame by
            frame...

     More keystrokes. The computer takes over, clarifying
     the image with passes of resolution.

     HICKS leans in closer as the image of the bag inches
     forward.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Just before the view's blocked,
            Zavitz reaches in his jacket for
            something. When the view returns,
            there's a shape change in Dean's
            bag. See the shadow variance? We
            reverse imaged it--

     FIEDLER points to another screen displaying a digitally-
     enhanced image of the shadowed object and its
     approximate shape.

                        FIEDLER (CONT'D)
            Something's definitely been added.
            It's not a video cassette, the
            shadow's wrong.

     REYNOLDS steps forward. His eyes are red. It's been a
     long night.

                        REYNOLDS
            What's your opinion?

                        FIEDLER
            It's hard to say for certain, these
            things are--

                        REYNOLDS
            I'm not asking you to say for certain.
            This is what you're trained to do,
            right?

                        FIEDLER
            Yes sir.

                        REYNOLDS
            Then what's your goddam opinion?

                        FIEDLER
               (beat)
            Zavitz had digital compression
            equipment. He could've downloaded
            into something. A disk, a chip,
            anything small enough to put in his
            pocket and run with. Whatever he
            put it in, he dropped it in that bag.

                        REYNOLDS
               (to HICKS)
            Get it.

     REYNOLDS heads for the door.

                        HICKS
            We'd have to--

                        REYNOLDS
            Get it.

     INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT

     DEAN drives with STACY as ERIC sleeps in the back seat.
     Various hats and souvenirs tell us that they've just
     come from a Redskins game.

     They drive in silence for a moment before...

                        STACY
            Bobby?

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        STACY
            How'd you get the information on
            DePinto?

                        DEAN
            What do you mean?

                        STACY
            Who did you work with to get the--

                        DEAN
            A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.

                        STACY
            Yeah, but you said you've never met
            him. How did you--

                        DEAN
            Honey, I don't like to talk about
            this stuff in front of Eric.

                        STACY
            Have you been working with Rachel?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        STACY
               (beat)
            Sorry.

                        DEAN
            It's okay.

     The RANGE ROVER pulls into the driveway.

     INT. DEAN'S HOME/ENTRY FOYER - NIGHT

     The DEAN's enter the doorway. ERIC and STACY are first.
     They stop, faces shocked. DEAN hasn't noticed yet. His
     hand automatically goes to the alarm key pad.

     CLOSE ON THE PAD - The LED reads: ARMED. DEAN punches
     the code -

                        STACY
            Oh my God -

     DEAN turns.

     The house is ransacked. The ALARM suddenly BLARES,
     adding mayhem.

     CLOSE-UP ON THE CEILING VENT - The CAMERA PUSHES IN
     TIGHT revealing a concealed, fiber-optic video lens the
     size of a pin-head.

     EXT. DEAN'S STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Several cars and a florist van are parked on the quiet
     street.

     INT. FLORIST VAN - CONTINUOUS

     The van is really an electronic surveillance post
     jammed with the latest equipment. A TECHIE with
     headphones eyes a monitor.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR showing the PIN HOLE SURVEILLANCE
     VIEW of STACY walking through a disheveled room in a
     state of shock while DEAN pulls out his cellular phone
     and dials.

                        DEAN
               (through the TECHIE's headphones)
            This is Robert Dean at 3325 Sutton
            Place. I want to report a break-in.

     INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - MORNING

     A black ball slams against a wall. PULL BACK to DEAN,
     who's angry, frustrated and drenched in sweat. He's
     embroiled in a hard, fast game with his friend, JERRY.

                        DEAN
            They took the espresso machine. The
            espresso machine, Jerry! Which
            makes sense, you know, because the
            crooks probably wanted to make
            themselves a latte before fencing
            the stereo.

                        JERRY
            Did they take your clothes?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        JERRY
            You've got a bunch of Armani suits,
            they didn't take 'em?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        JERRY
            Usually they take clothes.

                        DEAN
            Why don't you give 'em a call.

                        JERRY
            What about jewelry?

                        DEAN
            They didn't take the jewelry. They
            took the computers. They took the
            big-screen TV, they took my blender.

                        JERRY
            The blender?

                        DEAN
            I love my blender.

                        JERRY
            They didn't take the silverware?

                        DEAN
            No, but they took my blender.

                        JERRY
            Sounds like they didn't want
            anything that wasn't electric?

                        DEAN
            What?

                        JERRY
            They only took electrical appliances.

                        DEAN
            Serve the ball.

     INT. DEAN'S OFFICE BUILDING/LOBBY - MORNING

     A busy lobby for a major complex. DEAN, freshly
     showered, steps from a door marked: TO PARKING LEVELS.

                        MALE VOICE (O.S.)
            Robert Dean?

     DEAN turns to see MORELOS, 40's, an obsessive man with
     a terminal smile.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Yes?

                        MORELOS
            I didn't want to bother you during
            your racquetball game.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Thanks.
               (beat)
            Who are you?

     MORELOS shows him his badge.

                        MORELOS
            I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.

                        DEAN
            Hey, did you guys find my stuff?

                        MORELOS
            Your stuff?

                        DEAN
            The robbery.

                        MORELOS
            No, sir, I'm not involved with that.
            I'm doing a quick follow-up on a
            bus accident took place a few
            nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.

                        DEAN
            Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.

                        MORELOS
            Witnesses said you were there, but
            I notice you didn't file a report.

                        DEAN
            A report?

                        MORELOS
            A police report.

                        DEAN
            That's 'cause I wasn't there.

                        MORELOS
            You weren't at Harrison's Department
            Store the night before--

                        DEAN
            I was in the store, the accident
            was outside. It was a bus.

                        MORELOS
            Someone said you spoke to Mr.
            Zavitz before he died. I thought
            you might know something.

                        DEAN
            About what?

                        MORELOS
            About the accident.

                        DEAN
            I'm no expert, but I'm assuming
            that the impact of a moving bus
            against his body caused--

                        MORELOS
            Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.

                        DEAN
            What kind of trouble.

                        MORELOS
            You tell me.

                        DEAN
            I can't.

                        MORELOS
            Are you invoking attorney/client
            privilege.

                        DEAN
            I'm not his attorney.

                        MORELOS
            Than why can't you tell me.

                        DEAN
            Because I don't know.

                        MORELOS
            I'm just trying to determine if Mr.
            Zavitz was involved in something
            more than a simple bus accident.

                        DEAN
            Than why don't you talk to the bus
            driver?

                        MORELOS
            Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?

                        DEAN
            Somebody took my blender.

                        MORELOS
            We'd appreciate your cooperation.

                        DEAN
            I'm happy to help you all I can.
            But I didn't see the accident and I
            barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've
            gotta go to work.

     DEAN starts walking--MORELOS follows him.

                        MORELOS
            Did he give you anything?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        MORELOS
            Anything at all?

                        DEAN
            No, sir.

                        MORELOS
            Was he with anyone?

                        DEAN
            Not that I could see.

                        MORELOS
            Nobody gave you anything?

                        DEAN
            No.

                        MORELOS
            Why'd you go to Harrison's?

                        DEAN
            To buy lingerie.

                        MORELOS
            For your wife?

                        DEAN
            Yes, for my wife, what the hell
            kinds of questions are these.

                        MORELOS
            I thought maybe it might be for
            Rachel Banks.

     DEAN stops short and turns to MORELOS. He stares.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what's goin' on with
            Zavitz, but that was way, way outa
            line.
               (beat)
            You understand?

                        MORELOS
            Yes sir.

     DEAN steps into the elevator.

                        MORELOS
               (into concealed sleeve-mic)
            403 to 401. He's coming up.

     INT. LAW FIRM/CORRIDOR - DAY

     DEAN walks down the hall toward his office. He stops by
     PEERS as he enters his office.

                        PEERS
            'Morning, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            Hey. Would you get me what I need
            for Zwernickii and the Bellmoth
            motions.

                        PEERS
            Sure.

                        DEAN
            And do me a favor. Find out what
            you can about Daniel Zavitz. We did
            some work for him a few years back
            and there should be a file.

     DEAN enters his office and turns his computer on. It
     BEEPS, BOOTS and loads.

     INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

     LEVIN approaches the men's room. A MAINTENANCE MAN
     cleans up broken glass and water by the door. A sign
     reads: CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE. Levin turns and leaves.

                        MAINTENANCE MAN
               (into concealed sleeve mic)
            402 to 401. Doorstep's clear.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Two more MAINTENANCE MEN kneel in a stall adjusting a
     portable monitor and oscillator. They aim a directional
     antenna using slow, sweeping motions.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR displaying the intercepted signal.
     It's Dean's computer screen with text being typed in.
     The words are hard to read due to horizontal drift.
     After adjusting the antenna, the signal smooths.

     We PUSH CLOSER. The signal shows the current display of
     Dean's computer screen. We see Dean's O.S. command pull
     up his E-Mail. A prompt asks for a password.

     XXXXXXX appears.

     A switch is flipped. XXXXXXX becomes PUCCINI. Dean's
     "secure" file opens. Entries appear.

                        MAN #1
            402, this is 401. Password's "Puccini."

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Establishing. A large, busy place. LAWYERS and AIDES
     bustle in and out of this structure.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     A busy morning as ATTORNEYS wait their turn to present
     motions before the JUDGE.

     DEAN is seated next to LEVIN, making notes.

                        LEVIN
               (whispering)
            Dick Burns got a phone call this
            morning from someone wanting
            information on you.

                        DEAN
            The police?

                        LEVIN
            No. He said they were doing a
            credit check. Are you refinancing a
            loan?

                        DEAN
            You remember Daniel Zavitz?

                        LEVIN
            Yeah.

                        DEAN
            He got hit by a bus.

                        LEVIN
            What does that have to do with you?

                        DEAN
            I honestly don't know.

     ANOTHER ATTORNEY sits several rows back, watching the
     proceedings, briefcase in his lap.

     CLOSE-UP on the ATTORNEY's EAR with a mini-receiver.
     From it drift snippets of the DEAN/LEVIN conversation.

                        LEVIN (O.S.)
            Was Zavitz in trouble?

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            I don't know.

     A pulled back leather flap on the ATTORNEY's briefcase
     reveals the tip of a concealed microphone.

                        LEVIN (O.S.)
            You think there was a connection to--

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE GARAGE - DAY

     DEAN waits for the garage attendant to bring down his car.

                        PRATT (O.S.)
            Mr. Dean?

     DEAN turns. TWO MEN, PRATT and BINGHAM approach him.

                        DEAN
            Yeah?

                        PRATT
               (pulling out a card)
            We'd like to ask you some questions
            about Daniel Zavitz.

                        DEAN
            Who are you people?

                        PRATT
               (handing DEAN the card)
            I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech
            Security.

                        DEAN
            I went through this with an
            investigator this morning. If I
            could--

                        PRATT
            Mr. Zavitz was involved in an
            extortion scheme. We believe he
            passed you sensitive materials,
            possibly with your knowledge, and
            we need to--

                        DEAN
            He didn't.

                        PRATT
            We believe he did.

                        DEAN
            You're wrong.

                        PRATT
            We have good reason to believe that
            he passed you--

                        DEAN
            If he passed me materials, I'd have
            them. I don't.

                        PRATT
            We'd like to recover any materials
            Mr. Zavitz may have given you--

                        DEAN
            He didn't give me--

                        PRATT
            --otherwise we may have to--

                        DEAN
            Otherwise you may have to what?

                        PRATT
            We'd rather not--

                        DEAN
            Fuck you. You may have to what?

                        BINGHAM
               (beat)
            We may have to explore additional
            avenues.

     INT. TECH ROOM - NIGHT

     We HEAR a recording of the conversation between DEAN,
     PRATT and BINGHAM while we're CLOSE on an INK NEEDLE
     measuring Dean's voice stress levels.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            He didn't give me--

                        PRATT (V.O.)
            --otherwise we may have to--

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Otherwise you may have to what?

                        PRATT (V.O.)
            We'd rather not--

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Fuck you. You may have to--

     HICKS turns off the recorder. Standing with him is
     REYNOLDS, the Dean file and voice stress graph laid out
     before him.

                        HICKS
            He's arrogant and threatening.
            Voice stress points suggest he's
            worrying.

                        REYNOLDS
            Hiding something?

                        HICKS
            It was in his bag. Now it's not.

                        REYNOLDS
            Destroy his credibility before he
            goes public. Neutralize him. I
            don't want anyone listening to a
            word he has to say. Tell me about
            Rachel Banks.

     EXT. EXMOOR COUNTRY CLUB - EVENING

     Establishing. A massive clubhouse surrounded by
     expensive cars and tended grounds. We HEAR strains of
     Gershwin's "They Can't Take that Away from Me" from inside.

     INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     GUESTS mill about. DEAN and STACY are standing by the
     reception table where name tags and seating assignments
     are laid out. DEAN picks up a card that reads: MR. AND
     MRS. ROBERT DEAN - TABLE 122.

     JERRY steps over and puts his hand on DEAN's shoulder--

                        JERRY
            Can I talk to you a second?

                        DEAN
            Table 122?

                        JERRY
            That's what I want to talk to you
            about?

                        DEAN
            I wrote a check for a thousand
            dollars. You guys didn't have a
            table that was in the kitchen?

     JERRY gently pulls DEAN to a quiet corner...

                        JERRY
            The Congressman's very happy to
            have your support, but he's heard
            that there's an investigation.

                        DEAN
            An investigation? It was a bus
            accident.

                        JERRY
            He's heard that it's escalated.

                        DEAN
            Into what?

                        JERRY
            Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks
            there might be mob ties.

                        DEAN
            I'm a labor lawyer. There are
            always mob ties.

                        JERRY
            Just be cool.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON and OLD MATRON carefully chewing her food near
     a table card declaring: 122. The gala swings everywhere
     but here. DEAN and STACY are the only other diners at
     the table.

                        STACY
            I don't understand why Jerry
            couldn't clear this up.

                        DEAN
            Well, you know--

                        STACY
            He's got his priorities?

                        DEAN
            There's just, clearly, some
            administrative snafu. I'm sure this
            is the worst of it.

     EXT. DEAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     Establishing. A glass and steel high-rise reaching upward.

                        MARTHA (V.O.)
            Mr. Dean?

     INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN sits behind his desk as his secretary MARTHA enters.

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        MARTHA
            It's Rachel Banks.

     DEAN picks up the phone--

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. RACHEL'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

     RACHEL cradles a portable phone to her ear.

                        RACHEL
               (into phone)
            I got a call from my firm this
            morning saying don't come in.

                        DEAN
               (into phone)
            Why?

                        RACHEL
            There are reporters wanting to know
            about my relationship with you and
            how long I've worked for the mob.
            The mob, Bobby!

                        DEAN
            All right, look--

     Before DEAN can respond, there's a knock at the door.

     PEERS sticks his head in--

                        PEERS
            Blake and Silverberg want you in
            the conference room.

                        DEAN
               (softly)
            Shit.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     DEAN sits in the conference room by himself. He waits.

     After a moment, SILVERBERG and BLAKE stride in.

                        DEAN
            Listen--

                        SILVERBERG
            I got a call this morning from a
            source I trust. The Post is running
            a lead this afternoon about your
            involvement in the Bellmoth
            investigation.

                        DEAN
            I don't under--

                        BLAKE
            We've also been informed that the
            Grand Jury is going to call for an
            investigation into your affairs.

                        DEAN
            Why?

                        BLAKE
            They want to hold you in Contempt
            for ethics violations.

                        SILVERBERG
            They claim you helped create a
            shell company for Sam Vollotti in
            Zurich and that through your
            continuing relationship, the
            Gambino family's been able to exert
            influence and provide false
            witnesses to discredit our case.

                        DEAN
            Oh, well, that's true.

                        BLAKE
            It is?

                        DEAN
            Except for the part about my
            setting up a company in Zurich and
            knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti
            and having any relationship
            whatsoever with the Gambino family.

                        SILVERBERG
            Robert--

                        DEAN
            Gimme a week and four guys from
            litigation and I'll have the Post
            pleading with us not to sue for libel.

                        BLAKE
            Tell us about Rachel Banks.

                        DEAN
               (stunned)
            Rachel Banks?

                        SILVERBERG
            The attorney?

                        BLAKE
            Have you two been having an affair?

     DEAN is speechless...

                        DEAN
            What kind of a question is that?

                        BLAKE
            A direct one.

                        DEAN
            I have a professional relationship
            with Rachel Banks. She's the go-
            between for a private investigator
            I use.

                        SILVERBERG
            What's his name?

                        DEAN
            Brill.

                        BLAKE
            Why don't you just call Brill directly.

                        DEAN
            I don't know who he is.

                        BLAKE
            I'm told you had an affair with
            Rachel Banks four years ago.

                        DEAN
            Told by whom?

                        BLAKE
            Considering the enormous exposure
            to which you've subjected this firm,
            I'd think you'd do best to simply
            answer my questions.

                        DEAN
            Really?

                        BLAKE
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            Well considering what a colossal
            douche bag you are, David, maybe
            I'd do best to simply kick your ass
            all over the capitol.

                        SILVERBERG
            Gentlemen--

                        DEAN
            This is bullshit. Someone's mixing
            up a bunch of half-truths to ruin
            me and to ruin my case.

                        SILVERBERG
            Who would do that?

                        DEAN
            Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I
            don't know.

                        SILVERBERG
            Well until we find, you're gonna
            have to take a leave of absence.

                        DEAN
            You're firing me.

                        SILVERBERG
            A leave of absence. Until we've
            sorted this all out.

                        DEAN
            Put David on it. He seems anxious
            to clear my name.

                        SILVERBERG
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            Fuck off.

     INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/FOYER - EVENING

     DEAN enters.

                        DEAN
               (calling)
            Stacy!

     JENNY, early 30's, heads him off--

                        JENNY
            Robert--

                        DEAN
            Where's Stacy?

                        JENNY
            She doesn't want to talk to you.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            What are you talking--

                        JENNY
            She can't talk to you right now.

                        DEAN
               (beat)
            Why?

                        JENNY
            Because she's reading the newspaper,
            you asshole.

     DEAN pushes past her and heads to the back patio--

     EXT. BACK PATIO - CONTINUOUS

     STACY stares blankly, eyes red. A copy of The Post is
     beside her. A picture of DEAN and RACHEL, arm in arm,
     accompanies a headline.

     DEAN walks in--

                        DEAN
            Stacy?

                        STACY
            How could you let me find out like
            this?

                        DEAN
            Stacy, I found out like this. This
            is the first I'm hearing of--

                        STACY
            Robert--

                        DEAN
            It's not true.

                        STACY
               (reading)
            "Sources revealed an FBI
            investigation into a possible money
            laundering scheme that may have
            sent millions of dollars--

                        DEAN
            I've seen it.

                        STACY
               (reading)
            "At the center of the investigation
            are well-known Washington-area
            attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel
            Banks."

                        DEAN
            Yeah...look--

     STACY whips the paper at him--

                        STACY
            You swore!

                        DEAN
            I have lunch with Rachel once a
            month. She's my connection to an
            investigator.

                        STACY
            I told you I didn't want you seeing
            her.

                        DEAN
            I know.

                        STACY
            You had an affair with this woman,
            Robert, we went to a fucking
            counselor for a year.

                        DEAN
            I see her for business.

                        STACY
            You told me you weren't seeing her
            at all.

                        DEAN
            I didn't want you to be upset. I
            shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's
            nothing between me and Rachel Banks.

     STACY grabs another paper and shoves it across the
     table. DEAN picks it up.

     DEAN'S POV: A black and white surveillance photo of
     DEAN and RACHEL on a hotel balcony.

                        STACY (O.S.)
            The date stamp on the picture is
            last month. Is that where you and
            Rachel conduct business.

                        DEAN
               (shaking his head)
            It's not real...
               (to STACY)
            That's not me.

                        STACY
            Oh, please--

                        DEAN
            It's not a real picture, Stacy,
            it's been doctored-up.

                        STACY
            I think you should leave now, Robert.

                        DEAN
            Stacy--

                        STACY
            Leave this house.

     EXT. HYATT HOTEL - NIGHT

     Establishing. Downtown Washington, D.C.

     INT. REGISTRATION DESK - CONTINUOUS 

     A busy night. DEAN stands at the registration desk
     facing a DESK CLERK.

                        DESK CLERK
               (returning card)
            I'm sorry, sir, this card's been
            declined.

                        DEAN
            It's a brand new card.

                        DESK CLERK
            Maybe it's not connected yet.

                        DEAN
               (handing him another)
            Here, you can use this.

     The CLERK runs it through. Same result.

                        DESK CLERK
            I'm sorry.

     He returns the card, embarrassed for Dean. DEAN turns
     to leave...

     ...and stops dead. He stares at the empty floor by a
     pillar.

                        DEAN
            My suitcase--

                        DESK CLERK
            Sir?

                        DEAN
            My suitcase is gone.

     DEAN walks quickly around the area, looking at
     everything and everyone.

                        DESK CLERK
            I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.

                        DEAN
            Don't count on it.

     EXT. BANK MACHINE - NIGHT

     DEAN stands at the ATM, waiting for cash. There's a
     short line of PEOPLE behind him. His bank card spits
     out. The monitor reads:

                  Temporarily Unable to Process
                         this Transaction

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE ON AN OLD COLOR TV. The COMMERCIAL ENDS. A
     NEWSCASTER returns to deliver the late-night news.

                        NEWSCASTER
               (on TV)
            In Richmond today, Senate Majority
            Leader Sam Albert paid a visit to
            promote the ten-billion dollar
            Anti-Terror Bill.

     The newscast cuts to SAM ALBERT, late 60's, standing on
     State Capitol Building steps delivering a speech to
     community leaders.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (on TV)
            America is under assault, and this
            time it's from within. The gangs,
            the terrorists, the drug lords, the
            cults...

     PULLING AWAY from the TV, we explore the room. Dimly
     lit and cluttered with tired furniture.

                        SENATOR ALBERT (CONT'D)
               (on TV)
            It's a war like any other war. A
            war with victims and a war that
            requires courage and strength.

     Outside the window, a BUZZING NEON SIGN flickers red
     and blue. We finally end on DEAN, sitting on a sagging
     bed, rubbing his eyes...the newspaper with the
     doctored-up photo is sitting next to him.

     Thread-bare chairs and a couch. SAL and FRANKIE, both
     meaty guys in shiny shirts, sit facing DEAN, who stands
     before them.

                        SAL
            I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand.
            You wanna fuckin' what?

                        DEAN
            I'd like to speak to someone about
            what's happening to me.

                        FRANKIE
               (to SAL)
            What'd this guy say his name was?

                        SAL
            This is Bobby Dean, the Jew lawyer
            who squeezed DePinto.

                        DEAN
            Actually, that's not true.

                        SAL
            You didn't squeeze DePinto?

                        DEAN
            No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.

                        SAL
            Oh.

                        DEAN
            My wife's Jewish. But that probably
            doesn't matter right now.

                        FRANKIE
            What is it you want?

                        DEAN
            Someone's trying to destroy my life,
            and I'd like to find out who.

                        SAL
            And then what?

                        DEAN
            I'll see if I can, you know, work
            things out.

                        FRANKIE
            Well we'd sure like to help you.

                        DEAN
            You would?

                        FRANKIE
            Yes. But we can't.

                        DEAN
            Why not?

                        FRANKIE
            Because we, and our associates,
            have paid out hundreds of thousands
            of dollars to shyster lawyers like
            you, because of shyster lawyers
            like you, and we'd just as soon sit
            back and sip a beer while you get
            ass-banged by as many people as
            possible.

            I know, but--

            Wildlife footage, for God's sake. I
            don't see how he could've slipped
            you something that the FBI would be
            interested in.

                        DEAN
            That's my point.

                        MEG
            What's your point.

                        DEAN
            Well, I need to find out as much
            about Daniel as possible.

                        MEG
            Why?

                        DEAN
            Because my life is being ruined.

            Good. You're just what I need right

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            The drop's behind Seat 74. I leave
            something, he picks it up later.

     The ferry churns water. RACHEL moves to a wind
     protected seat, leaving Seat 74 empty. DEAN keeps watch
     on the seat as he scans the paper.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Any idea what he looks like?

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            My guess is male, somewhere in his
            40's or 50's.

     A MONTAGE of different people occupying Seat 74.

     A middle-aged DRUNK passed out in the seat. A TEEN-AGED
     boy with glasses chats with friends.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            Race, height, weight, you're on
            your own.

     An OLD LADY reads a book. She sees DEAN eyeing her and
     smiles nervously. DEAN returns to his paper.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
            Now I don't know how he's gonna
            feel about someone tracking him
            down. He's reclusive. I'm sure he
            has his reasons.

     DEAN's alone now. The ferry docks for the night. The
     last passengers, TWO NUNS, disembark. DEAN rises to go.
     Brill's a no-show.

     INT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT

     DEAN walks down the ramp. It's dark in the empty
     terminal. Not the best place at this hour. Up ahead,
     TWO MEN stand in the darkness, then kissing. Down
     another hall, SOUNDS OF NEARING FOOTSTEPS. DEAN detours
     into--

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Empty. DEAN stands at a sink, water running. He glances
     at the door. He splashes water on his face. Suddenly--

     --DEAN's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved
     into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.

                        DEAN
            Jesus! What?! You want money?!

                        MAN
            Shut the fuck up.

     Hands frisk DEAN. Up and down the legs, behind the back
     and chest. A wallet is removed, ID's looked at - then
     returned. DEAN turns to see--

     A MAN, early 50's. He sweeps a signal frequency locator
     over DEAN's body. The needle reacts at DEAN's foot.

                        MAN
               (gesturing)
            Your shoe.

                        DEAN
            My shoe?

                        MAN
            Gimme the shoe.

     DEAN complies with the strange request as the MAN flips
     out a knife.

                        DEAN
            Brill?

                        "BRILL"
            Brill's dead. He died of small pox
            when he was two and he was buried
            in a Kansas field.
               (prying away DEAN's heel)
            My name doesn't matter.

     CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a
     miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then
     returns the shoe.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            A tracker. Thousand yard range.
            They're close.

     The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip
     bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down
     the toilet.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            C'mon.

     "BRILL" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window,
     not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.

     EXT. LOADING DECK - MOMENT LATER

     DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock.
     "BRILL" motions him to follow as he moves off into the
     shadows.

     The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed
     by FOOTSTEPS. "BRILL" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and
     removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE.
     "BRILL" looks. They're gone.

     EXT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT

     Establishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal.
     Several cars are parked. One's a cab. "BRILL" opens the
     driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door.

                        "BRILL"
            No. In back like you're a customer.

     INT. CAB - NIGHT

     "BRILL" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to
     all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. "BRILL" flips on
     the meter and guns into traffic.

                        "BRILL"
            What happened?

                        DEAN
            It started with the information you
            gave me on DePinto. After we talked,
            he agreed to resign. Next, a phony
            detective asked me about Daniel
            Zavitz. Then an investigator
            questioned me about an extortion
            scheme they claimed Zavitz was
            behind. The FBI started looking
            into mob connections. A doctored
            picture in the paper. Overnight,
            I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank
            accounts, everything gone.

     "BRILL" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several
     car lengths behind.

                        "BRILL"
            DePinto's dead.

                        DEAN
            Oh Jesus.

                        "BRILL"
            They found him yesterday folded
            neatly in a car trunk. What about
            Zavitz?

     "BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks
     in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars
     behind.

                        DEAN
            I don't know anything about Zavitz.

                        "BRILL"
            You said he was behind an extortion
            scheme.

                        DEAN
            They said he was behind an
            extortion scheme.

     "BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.

                        "BRILL"
            And you were the last one to talk
            to him.

                        DEAN
            Yes.

                        "BRILL"
            What'd he say to you?

                        DEAN
            Nothing.

                        "BRILL"
            What'd he give to you?

                        DEAN
            Nothing.

                        "BRILL"
            Don't bullshit me, I can save your
            life.

                        DEAN
            I'm telling you, I--

     The ride from hell gets worse as "BRILL" screeches
     another turn. The car ahead stops and "BRILL" screeches
     past on two wheels.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            I just gave him my card.

                        "BRILL"
            He didn't give you an address? He
            didn't give you a phone number?

                        DEAN
            Nothing. Two nights later I was
            robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.

     "BRILL" takes an impossible left into another alley.
     The Chevy follows. "BRILL"'s good. The guy in the
     Chevy's better.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            Um...who's that?

                        "BRILL"
            Don't know. Did you check everywhere?
            Maybe it was hidden in something.
            Maybe there was someone else--

                        DEAN
            Someone else?

                        "BRILL"
            Maybe you bumped into someone who
            took it and you didn't even know.

     The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks
     snap back from the force.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            Shit!

     WHAM! They're hit again. "BRILL" pulls out a communicator.

                        "BRILL" (CONT'D)
            209 to anyone! I need some help here!

                        DEAN
            Who are you calling?!

     WHACK! "BRILL" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking
     him silly as WHAM!--the cab's rear-ended again.

                        "BRILL"
               (trying again)
            This is 209! Does anyone copy?!

     Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy
     street, then a bakery shop.

     He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no
     use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to
     bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel.
     It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross
     traffic and--

     BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab
     is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-
     hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the
     broken main.

     DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere.
     "BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not
     moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and
     crawls from the wreckage.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     DEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach.

                        WOMAN
            Look out! He's got a gun!

     They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks
     around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like
     a coiled snake.

     DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to
     ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.

     INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT

     STACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of
     the paper, which now has a photograph of DEAN and
     RACHEL walking in the park from the day before.

     The phone rings and STACY reaches for it...

                        STACY
               (into phone)
            Hello?

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN stands at a pay phone--

                        DEAN
               (into phone)
            Stacy, don't hang up.

                        STACY
            Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?

                        DEAN
            Stacy--

                        STACY
            I'm looking at a picture of you and
            Rachel taken yesterday.

                        DEAN
            I know, but listen--

                        STACY
            Was that doctored-up, too?

                        DEAN
            No, I was with her yesterday. I
            want you to take Eric and go to our
            parents house. I want you to do it
            right now.

                        STACY
            I went to the grocery store. My ATM
            and credit cards didn't work. I
            couldn't buy food.

                        DEAN
            I know.

                        STACY
            I went to the bank to see why. They
            said you emptied our accounts--

                        DEAN
            It wasn't me.

                        STACY
            This is science-fiction Robert! The
            manager showed me the transfer
            notice with your signature on it.

                        DEAN
            Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me.
            Now goddamit--

                        STACY
            My father's put me in touch with an
            attorney. He'll be--

     A hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. DEAN turns
     to see a MAN, late 50's, gruff and alert. It's the guy
     driving the Chevy.

                        MAN
            Put the phone down. Do as I say.

     DEAN does nothing, temporarily frozen. A pistol jabs
     him hard.

                        DEAN
            Alright, alright--

     DEAN replaces the phone. The man removes DEAN's gun.
     Nearby, two PEOPLE chat at a restaurant hostess desk,
     unaware.

                        MAN
            Move to the elevators.

     DEAN does but is suddenly redirected through a roof-
     access door.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     A TECHNICIAN sits in a van jammed with high-tech
     surveillance gear. HICKS is next to him, a phone
     pressed to his ear.

                        HICKS
            We just picked up his call.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

     REYNOLDS, dressed in a tux, presses his cellular to his
     ear, while behind him MARSHAL and SHAFFER, also in
     tuxedos, have a heated discussion.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            30 minutes ago you said we had him.
            What in hell's goin' on out there?

                        HICKS
               (into phone)
            He had help.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            Help from whom?
               (he hears the answer)
            Christ.

     EXT. HIGH-RISE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Eight stories up and deserted. The lit dome of the
     Capitol building shines like a beacon in the D.C. skyline.

     DEAN suddenly slams against a wall--

                        DEAN
            Hey!

                        MAN
            Forget me, forget what I did for
            you. Don't ever mention my name or
            try to contact me again. Get it?

                        DEAN
            I don't know you, I don't know your
            name, I don't know what the hell
            you did for me except hang up on my
            wife and slam me into a wall, but
            I'm getting pretty fuckin' sick of
            this! Get it?!

                        MAN
            Seat 74.

                        DEAN
               (pause)
            You're Brill.

                        BRILL
            You knew the deal. No contact.

                        DEAN
            Who was that other guy?

                        BRILL
            One of many people who would live a
            word with you.

                        DEAN
            Who are they?

                        BRILL
            You've heard of the National Security
            Agency?

                        DEAN
            What do they have to do with this?

                        BRILL
            That's who they are.

                        DEAN
            The NSA?

                        BRILL
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            You're crazy.

                        BRILL
               (starting to leave)
            Okay.

                        DEAN
            Wait.

                        BRILL
            You drive a black BMW, license
            plate SRK1339?

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        BRILL
               (reaching in his pocket)
            I clipped this from your wheel well
            just before they towed your car away.

     BRILL pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a
     walk-man.

                        DEAN
            What is that?

                        BRILL
            It's a SAT-tracker.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that means.

                        BRILL
            Like a LowJack, but two generations
            ahead of what the police use. It
            pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that means.

                        BRILL
            230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band
            for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that means.

                        BRILL
            It means the NSA can read the time
            off your wristwatch.

                        DEAN
            Why are they after me?

                        BRILL
            If I knew, they'd be after me.
            Which they probably are right now.
            'Bye.

                        DEAN
            Wait. What do I do?

                        BRILL
            Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What
            you did, who you were...that's done.
            I'd find a quiet job somewhere
            shoveling snow.

     A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL
     eyes it cautiously.

                        DEAN
            Why don't they just identify
            themselves and tell me what they want?

                        BRILL
            They're spooks.

                        DEAN
            I don't know what that--

                        BRILL
            Exposure. They can't have it. They
            wanna learn what you know and then
            deal with it.

                        DEAN
            I don't know anything.

                        BRILL
            No shit.

                        DEAN
            What am I gonna do?! I mean, like,
            for the rest of my life?!

                        BRILL
            Hey, if you live another week I'll
            be impressed.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            Look, you gave me some work over
            the last year. We'll call it even.

     BRILL turns to leave--

                        DEAN
               (blocking the exit door)
            What if I find out what they're
            after. You know these people, I don't.

                        BRILL
            And you won't. Now move--

                        DEAN
            I'll pay you.

                        BRILL
               (taking out his pistol)
            They froze your accounts. Get outa
            my way.

     DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even
     as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.

                        DEAN
            I've got a hundred-thousand dollars
            in jewelry in a safe-deposit box
            under a third party name.

     BRILL looks at the ground. Torn.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            How many years have you been hiding
            from them? How many years have you
            been running?
               (beat)
            What'd they do to you?

                        BRILL
               (pause)
            If you find something, chalk the
            Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go
            to Temperanceville. It's South of
            Salisbury.
               (giving DEAN his pistol)
            And take this.

     And with that, he's gone.

     DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at
     the city.

     DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the
     building. MEN storm out an move inside.

     DEAN quickly backs away.

     INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     DEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He
     hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            303 to 301. Floor one secured.
            Moving to two.

     DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN.
     Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run
     when he sees a security camera directly above.

     Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray
     coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.

     DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES
     stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left.
     That door's opening as well.

     Trapped.

     Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to
     an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a
     shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He
     retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.

     DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked
     door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he
     rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.

     No lock.

     He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk
     against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.

                        JONES (O.S.)
               (disturbingly calm)
            Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's
            nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk.

     Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.

     No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song
     "These Boots are Made for Walking".

                        JONES (O.S.)
            It'd be easier for all of us if you
            just come out. Nothing'll happen.

     DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.

                        JONES (O.S.)
            It's quite hopeless what you're
            doing, Mr. Dean.

                        DEAN
            I swear to God I'll shoot.

                        JONES (O.S.)
               (chuckling)
            I think you might be over-reacting
            there, Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.

                        DEAN
            Go ahead. I hear you fine.

     The door pushes in--

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            I said I'll shoot!

     The door keeps pushing.

     DEAN FIRES high.

     The pushing stops.

     Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching.
     DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and
     sets the sweater on fire.

     He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam
     cups in on top of it.

     The pushing starts again, but before DEAN can fire, a
     small cylindrical device drops into the room.

     A STUN GRENADE.

     DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.

     The window is blown open. Smoke billows out. DEAN,
     temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as
     fire engines arrive.

     INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

     Fire trucks, police cars and an ambulance arrive
     beneath DEAN as HICKS watches from his van.

                        HICKS
            I don't fuckin' believe this!
               (into radio-mic)
            301 to all units. Everyone out! Now!
            We'll take him at the hospital.

     INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

     DEAN sits in back with a PARA-MEDIC, covered in soot,
     breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance
     WAILS and weaves through traffic. He looks through the
     rear window to see--

     TWO CARS FOLLOWING, keeping pace. Off to the side, RFK
     Stadium is emptying, a Redskins game is over.

     DEAN rips off the oxygen mask--

                        DEAN
            Tell him to stop the ambulance.

                        PARAMEDIC
            Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.

                        DEAN
            Tell him to stop the ambulance.

                        PARAMEDIC
            Now you're a little shaken up, but
            we're gonna get you on your feet in--

     DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the
     PARAMEDIC's face--

                        PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
               (to the driver)
            --stop the ambulance.

                        DEAN
            Thank you.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open.
     DEAN leaps out into the crowd.

     The OTHER CARS pull over and PRATT and JONES exit. They
     scan the area and see DEAN descending a stairwell
     marked: METRO.

     INT. METRO STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT

     DEAN stands at the end of the crowded platform. PRATT
     and JONES work through the CROWD as the train pulls in.
     DEAN slides on board. The departure HORN sounds. JONES
     and PRATT step on.

     INT. METRO - NIGHT

     DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT
     and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.

     DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.

     He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock
     and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.

     DEAN opens the door.

     And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in
     either direction. He starts running.

     Then he hears it.

     The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.

     Trapped.

     On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.

     He runs down the track with all that's left.

     PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the
     oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as
     the train SWISHES by.

     DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing
     greasy ground as the train screeches over him.

     Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.

     Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.

     He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.

                        DEAN
               (under his breath)
            I hate these guys.

     Then he sees an "EMERGENCY ACCESS" sign beaming in the
     darkness. A God-send. DEAN runs for it.

     EXT. METRO EMERGENCY ACCESS EXIT - NIGHT

     PRATT and JONES fly out the door and into a park.

     It's empty. Quiet.

     No Dean anywhere.

                        REYNOLDS (V.O.)
            I'm confused about something. Maybe
            you can help me out.

     EXT. TERRACE - CONTINUOUS

     The Lincoln Memorial is seen in the distance. REYNOLDS
     has broken off PARTY GUESTS and paces in his tux, an
     encrypted cellular phone pressed to his ear.

                        REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
            I sit on top of the greatest
            intelligence gathering organization
            in human history. Why can't I bring
            in a man whose name is in the
            fucking phonebook?!

                        HICKS
            He's clever. He had help.

                        REYNOLDS
            He's clever? He had help?
               (beat)
            Oh.

                        HICKS
            Sir--

                        REYNOLDS
            No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
            you were hoping to be transferred
            to a weathership outside Greenland.

                        HICKS
            I just meant--

                        REYNOLDS
            I don't care if he's Solomon with
            Saint Joseph sitting in his lap. I
            want the tape and I want him. Now is--

     A WAITER with a tray steps out onto the terrace...

                        REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
               (to the WAITER)
            Yes?

                        WAITER
            Puffed cheese?

                        REYNOLDS
            No thank you.

                        WAITER
            I also have tiny pizzas and
            mushrooms stuffed with--

                        REYNOLDS
            Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?

                        WAITER
            No.

                        REYNOLDS
            Then let's assume I don't.

                        WAITER
            Yes sir.

     The WAITER goes back inside.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            Now is that clear?

                        WAITER
            Yes sir.

     REYNOLDS disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to
     the party.

     EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO BUILDING - NIGHT

     DEAN watches from the shadows. It seems quiet. He's
     about to move for the entrance when he sees--

     A cigarette lighter flame-up inside a parked car. TWO
     MEN sit inside, watching. DEAN retreats into the shadows.

     EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Quiet. DEAN listens through the door and hears nothing.
     He KNOCKS softly.

     No reply.

     He tries the doorknob. It opens.

     INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

     DEAN enters. The place is still.

                        DEAN
            Rachel?

     No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp
     is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into
     the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.

     DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.

                        DEAN
               (approaching)
            Rachel?

     She doesn't respond. He touches her.

     Nothing.

     He turns her over. Her face is frozen, eyes open, neck
     purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.

                        DEAN
            Oh God--

     DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down.

     Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it.

     DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is
     stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN.

     Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for
     anything else of his that may have been planted inside
     the apartment.

     Under the bed - a cufflink.

     In the bathroom - a hairbrush.

     On the desk - documents with his name on them.

     DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a
     towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from
     everything he touched.

     Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--

     A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing,
     kissing...and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.

     INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     JERRY walks alone through the large underground garage
     on the way to his car. He pauses, thinking he's heard
     something.

     Nothing.

     He continues walking. He reaches his car. Suddenly
     someone comes up behind him fast. JERRY spins--

     --it's DEAN.

                        DEAN
               (whispering)
            Jerry--

                        JERRY
            Christ!

                        DEAN
            Ssh!

                        JERRY
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            It's the NSA. They're the ones
            doing this.

                        JERRY
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            The NSA's doing this 'cause they
            think I have something. And they
            killed--

                        JERRY
            Calm down.

                        DEAN
            They killed Rachel.

                        JERRY
               (pause)
            Rachel's dead?

                        DEAN
            Yes.

                        JERRY
            Jesus.

                        DEAN
            My stuff's all over her apartment.

                        JERRY
            Bobby--

                        DEAN
            They're framing me.

                        JERRY
            Why would they--

                        DEAN
            I don't know. I mean--

                        JERRY
            Why would the NSA--

                        DEAN
            I don't know!

                        JERRY
            You're tired.

                        DEAN
            Jerry--

                        JERRY
            Listen to me.

                        DEAN
            You gotta--

                        JERRY
            No, listen to me. You gotta let me
            bring you in.

                        DEAN
            No, I--

                        JERRY
            You gotta let me bring you in to
            the police.

                        DEAN
            I won't make it to the police. They
            won't let me get there. You go.

                        JERRY
            To the cops?

                        DEAN
            To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em
            to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what
            they're after. Make a deal.

                        JERRY
            Bobby, you're in way over your head.

                        DEAN
            Go to 'em, Jerry.

                        JERRY
            I have a family.

                        DEAN
            So do I!

     JERRY looks at the ground for a long moment...

                        JERRY
            I'm sorry, man.

                        DEAN
            No. No, it's okay.

     DEAN starts to leave...

                        JERRY
            Bobby? Piece of advice?

                        DEAN
            Yeah?

                        JERRY
            Turn yourself in.

                        DEAN
            Jerry?

                        JERRY
            Yeah?

                        DEAN
            Go fuck yourself.

     EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

     Establishing. A quiet street in Dean's neighborhood.
     Several REPORTERS are camped in Dean's driveway
     entrance, sipping coffees. Farther down the street, a
     JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked. The driver waits and
     watches.

     EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME

     DEAN sneaks between two large houses, ducking by
     windows and scaling a fence. Somewhere a DOG BARKS a
     warning as DEAN plows through a large hedge, entering
     the backyard to his home.

     INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - SAME TIME

     DEAN quietly unlocks the door and enters. He listens.

     The house is quiet. Empty.

     INT. DEAN'S FOYER - DAY

     KEYS JINGLE in the front lock. The door opens and STACY
     enters.

     The TV suddenly REMOTES ON - VOLUME LOUD.

     She turns as DEAN approaches fast--

                        STACY
            Robert--

     DEAN's hand cups her mouth as he pulls her into a
     pantry closet.

     INT. PANTRY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

                        DEAN
               (barely a whisper)
            Listen to me. The house is bugged.
            So we gotta be quiet, okay?

     STACY nods understanding. DEAN slowly removes his hand.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
               (whispering)
            Is Eric in school?

                        STACY
            Yes.

                        DEAN
            Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?

                        STACY
            Just reporters.

                        DEAN
            I wish you'd gone to your parents
            like I asked you.

                        STACY
            This is my house. Nobody's kicking
            me out of my house. I picked those
            drapes.

                        DEAN
            I don't think anybody wants the
            drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes
            are okay.

                        STACY
            What happened to your head?

                        DEAN
            I was in a car chase and a small
            explosion. Now listen to me: The
            NSA is behind this. They think that
            guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz,
            they think Zavitz gave me a tape or
            computer chip of some kind that
            could be damaging to them. So
            they're doing all these things
            electronically. The bank records,
            the surveillance. They're the ones
            who broke into the house. Now I
            know there's no reason to believe
            me. But I love you. And I love our
            son. So just believe me anyway.
               (pause)
            Please.

     STACY gently touches his forehead where he's been cut...

                        STACY
            Does that hurt?

                        DEAN
            Well...yeah.

                        STACY
            Good.

                        DEAN
            Stacy--

     She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good
     long time before STACY smacks him on the arm--

                        STACY
            I told you they could do this. I
            told you they had this kind of
            capability and that with this anti-
            terrorism it would be just another--

                        DEAN
            Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the
            best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.

     She kisses him again.

                        STACY
            I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

                        DEAN
            That's okay.

                        STACY
            I opened the present you got me
            from Harrison's.

                        DEAN
            You opened the thing?

                        STACY
            The lingerie.

                        DEAN
            That was for Christmas.

                        STACY
            I was missing you.

                        DEAN
            You're as bad as Eric. I've got an
            entire family of people who root
            through--

     It dawns on him...everything starts coming together...

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            ...who root through...uh...presents,
            and...

                        STACY
            What is it?

                        DEAN
            Oh Christ.

     INT. JEEP GRAND-CHEROKEE - DAY

     The DRIVER continues to watch the area. Then--

     DRIVER's POV: THE RANGE ROVER flies out of the driveway,
     tires SCREECHING as it speeds through the quiet
     neighborhood.

     The REPORTERS stare at each other a beat--

     --then leap for their cars.

                        DRIVER
               (into sleeve-mic)
            504 to 501. Rover's fleeing west on
            Sutton. Driver appeared male!

                        JONES (O.S.)
               (radio effect)
            What's the wife's '20'?

                        DRIVER
            She's off location with a friend.

                        JONES (O.S.)
            Alright - move! 501 - all units.
            Take him down!

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Unmarked cars of various descriptions rapidly appear
     from nowhere giving chase.

                        ANOTHER AGENT (O.S.)
               (radio effect)
            502 to 501, I've got the eyeball.
            He's approaching Ridgeview, we'll
            take him at the intersection.

     The RANGE ROVER speeds through the neighborhood.
     Suddenly, two cars are out in front, blocking the way.
     The Range Rover swerves and breaks as two more cars rip
     up behind, boxing it in. An un-marked Trans-Am lags
     behind, keeping reporters at bay.

     Doors fling open. JONES and THREE MEN, all in plain
     clothes, pistols and MAC-10 aimed at the Range Rover.

     Nothing happens.

     The MEN move closer--

     JONES grabs the door and rips it open, revealing Dean's
     PISS-FRIGHTENED NANNY behind the wheel in Dean's trench
     coat and hat.

     JONES YANKS her out, puts her hard to the ground, gun
     jammed to her head, as other search the Range Rover for
     Dean.

     EXT. DEAN'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN drives the Nanny's rusted, low-rider Dodge out of
     the driveway. He pauses and looks. The streets are empty.

     He turns onto the street and calmly drives away.

     EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

     Establishing. A playground jammed with kids. A kickball
     game's in progress. ERIC waits his turn to kick. TRACY,
     a college-age teaching assistant comes over.

                        TRACY
            Eric?

     ERIC looks up...

                        TRACY (CONT'D)
            Your father's here.

     EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

     DEAN stands at the edge of the playground in clean,
     casual clothes. ERIC runs over, face glowing.

                        ERIC
            Dad!

                        DEAN
            Do I know you?

                        ERIC
            Where've you been?

                        DEAN
            Having an adventure. I can't tell
            you about it right now, but I'll
            tell you about it soon.

                        ERIC
            Are you and mom getting a divorce?

                        DEAN
            No. We're never getting a divorce.
            We were having a fight. It happens
            sometimes.

                        ERIC
            Who won the fight?

                        DEAN
            Men don't win fights with women,
            son, I'll tell you about that
            sometime, too. In the meantime,
            I've got a question for you, and
            it's incredibly important that you
            tell me the truth. Under no
            circumstances will I be angry with
            you. This is a total Get-Out-Of-
            Jail-Free card. Ready?

                        ERIC
            Yeah.

                        DEAN
            Did you take anything--anything at
            all--out of those Christmas bags I
            brought home last week.

     ERIC hangs his head...busted...then shouts to a GROUP
     OF KIDS on the playground...

                        ERIC
               (shouting)
            DYLAAAAN!!

     DYLAN comes trotting over, carrying his backpack...

                        DYLAN
            Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?

                        DEAN
            Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--

                        DYLAN
            Oh, God, I knew it was stupid, I
            knew we'd get caught. But the
            Gameboy was just sitting there.
            Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes.
            We took the GameBoy out of the bag,
            but with every intention of putting
            it back.

                        DEAN
               (pause)
            You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.

     DYLAN hunts through the backpack as DEAN and ERIC looks
     on. All kinds of junk flies out--candy, comics, game-
     cartridges--

                        DYLAN
            It was broken when we found it, I
            swear. I tried fixing it for you. I
            even put in new batteries.
               (pulling out the GameBoy)
            The screen scrambles whenever you
            boot up. I'd try to get your money
            back.

     DEAN eyes the pieces of the GameBoy, knowing that
     somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key
     to his problems.

     EXT. BALTIMORE SHERATON - EVENING

     PEDESTRIANS walk on the sidewalk. A MAN comes along and
     drops a few letters in the corner mailbox.

     From the other direction comes DEAN. Without stopping,
     he casually slashes the mailbox with chalk.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     DEAN's asleep. There's a SOFT SHUFFLING SOUND. The
     CAMERA EXPLORES for the source, moving by the windows,
     flashing neon, a TV and finally, the door.

     We PUSH CLOSER as a MULE TOOL snakes under the door.

     The tool pops upright against the door's inside. The
     strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens. The
     doorknob turns and opens.

     SOMEONE slips in--

     CLOSE ON DEAN asleep. A HAND covers his mouth. DEAN's
     eyes go wide.

     Then he sees it's BRILL...

                        BRILL
               (whispering)
            Get dressed. We're leaving.

                        DEAN
               (whispering)
            You could knock on the door, you
            know, and I'd open it.

                        BRILL
            Move it.

     EXT. CAPE CHARLES - 4 A.M.

     Establishing. The 10-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge crosses
     the Bay like a serpent worming toward distant Norfolk.
     Traffic is thin at this hour.

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
            Dean, the attorney recently under
            investigation for a money laundering
            scheme, was seen leaving Ms. Banks
            apartment late last night.

     We PUSH IN on a TOYOTA PICK-UP truck heading south.

     INT. PICK-UP - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL drives with DEAN riding shotgun.

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
            Police are seeking--

     BRILL ejects as cassette from the dashboard and hands
     it to DEAN.

                        BRILL
            I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.

                        DEAN
            And you were worried about me.
            That's nice, I appreciate--

                        BRILL
            I was worried about my hundred and
            twenty 'K'.

                        DEAN
            We said a hundred.

                        BRILL
            The price rises with the temperature
            and right now you're smokin'. But
            you're right, you should shop
            around and get the best price. I'll
            just let you out here.

                        DEAN
               (agreeing)
            One-twenty.

     BRILL checks the rear-view mirror.

     BRILL's POV: Car headlights following in the distance.

                        BRILL
            Did you call anyone?

                        DEAN
            What do you mean?

                        BRILL
            I mean did you call anyone.

                        DEAN
            Look, my wife is understandably--

                        BRILL
            Jesus!

                        DEAN
            I called my wife!

                        BRILL
            What'd I tell you?

                        DEAN
            I didn't use my name.

                        BRILL
            What'd I tell you?

                        DEAN
            I called from a payphone!

                        BRILL
            What'd I tell you?

                        DEAN
            You told me no calls.

                        BRILL
            I told you no calls.

     BRILL does a bootleggers U-turn. Several cars pass by
     in the opposite direction.

                        DEAN
            Sorry.

                        BRILL
            You don't get it. They go through
            your phone records. They fuckin'
            monitor everyone you called in the
            last--

                        DEAN
            I didn't use my name.

                        BRILL
            Oh, I'll bet that threw 'em off the
            scent. I sure hope you covered the
            mouthpiece with a handkerchief and
            used a funny voice!

     BRILL turns off the headlights, does another U-turn,
     pulls off on an emergency road and stops.

     He turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks
     up into the night sky and listens.

     BRILL's POV: A cloudy night. Silent except for the
     water and a distant fog-horn. No sounds of aircraft.

                        DEAN
               (looking up as well)
            I don't hear anything.
               (on BRILL's silence)
            Maybe you're wrong.

     BRILL is staring upward...

                        BRILL
            A hundred and fifty.

     INT. NRO KEYHOLE-12 LAB - CONTINUOUS

     Re-establishing. A massive, dark place filled with
     glowing monitors.

     CLOSE ON A MONITOR - displaying a live SAT feed showing
     a thermograph image of Brill's truck. The color heat
     image of BRILL looking upward is fairly clear. He pops
     his head back into the truck and pulls onto the road.
     The satellite continues tracking the truck.

                        BRILL (O.S.)
            It's a consumated marriage.

     INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT

     BRILL drives along a high fence surrounding acres of
     empty warehouses, docks and rust-bitten fences. He's
     still on constant alert - looking for sign of their
     presence.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            The NSA's been in bed with the
            entire tele-communications industry
            since the 40's. They've infected
            everything: Banks, computers,
            phones, mail, name it.
               (stopping the car near
                the gate)
            The more technology we buy into,
            the easier it is keeping tabs on us.
            It's a brave new world.
               (handing DEAN the keys)
            At least it better be.

                        DEAN
            How do you know so much?

                        BRILL
            None of your business.

                        DEAN
            You used to work for 'em, didn't you?

                        BRILL
            I was a traffic analyst.

     DEAN gives him a look that says, "I don't know what
     that means".

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            I intercepted phone calls.

                        DEAN
            How'd you get around the tap orders?

                        BRILL
            They can tap anything as along as
            it's an airwave intercept.
            Cellulars and pagers your kid can
            do.
               (driving through)
            Hard-line calls we'd pick off the
            relays as they were being fed into
            ground cables or fired up to the
            SATs. We'd suck in everything. All
            foreign, most domestic.
               (DEAN re-closes the gate)
            Domestic was my group. Druggies,
            radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we
            wanted.

                        DEAN
               (climbing back in)
            How'd you have the manpower to--

                        BRILL
               (driving again)
            Meade has 18 underground acres of
            computers. They scan every
            phonecall for target words like
            "bomb" or "President". We red-flag
            phone numbers or voice
            prints...whatever we wanted. When
            the computers found something, it
            was bounced to comparative analysis.

                        DEAN
            Jesus.

                        BRILL
            That was twenty years ago. With
            digital? They can suck a salt grain
            off a beach.

                        DEAN
            Why'd you leave?

                        BRILL
            It was '72. I figured we had enough
            problems without monitoring a
            Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I
            sold my story to Ramparts and split.

                        DEAN
            They come after you?

                        BRILL
               (shrugging it off)
            Well...there'd be too much
            disclosure to prosecute me. So they
            ruined my records and made sure I'd
            never hold a real job again.

     The pick-up stops by a long two-story warehouse.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            What do you think?

                        DEAN
            Looks like Detroit.

                        BRILL
            Welcome to Santa's Workshop.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     BRILL and DEAN enter the 2nd story of a large, empty
     structure. DEAN is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag.

     In the center of the cavernous space, a windowless,
     cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.

                        BRILL
            I call it the jar. No phone or
            utility lines going in.

     BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He
     pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.

                        BRILL
            Self-contained. Unplugged from the
            world.
               (opening Jar door)
            Nothing for a wire bug to piggy-
            back in on. That leaves only
            transmitters and signal sweep for
            those.
               (turning on the light)
            Now let's see what we got.

     DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its
     contents (the pieces of the GameBoy) on to the table.

     EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

     DEAN sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching
     Norfolk rise from dawn's fog.

     In the distance we see BRILL coming down from the
     warehouse toward DEAN.

     He stands behind DEAN for a moment before...

                        BRILL
            That is one ugly sunrise.

                        DEAN
               (pause)
            It really is.
               (pause)
            Did you find anything?

                        BRILL
            Yeah.
               (beat)
            Take a walk with me.

     DEAN gets up and joins BRILL. The two of them start in
     the direction of the second warehouse.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            Remember when Senator Hamersley
            died in an accident up near Shenandoah?

                        DEAN
            Yeah.

                        BRILL
            The NSA killed him.

                        DEAN
            Jesus. Do you have proof?

                        BRILL
            Well, actually, you have proof.
            Could you walk a little faster please.

                        DEAN
            What's going on?

                        BRILL
            They're here.

                        DEAN
            Who?

                        BRILL
            Them.

                        DEAN
            Where?

                        BRILL
            Here?

                        DEAN
            Here?!

                        BRILL
            In the warehouse. They're hiding in
            a duct on the third floor. When we
            go back inside, they're gonna kill
            us. When they notice that we're
            moving toward the car, they'll come
            running out of the building.

                        DEAN
            'Kay, well, could you walk faster,
            please.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     JONES and THREE MEN are huddled in a duct.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
               (through radio)
            They're heading to the car.

                        JONES
            Move it.

     JONES and the three men start down the corridor, guns
     drawn.

     EXT. THE SECOND WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting
     the air out of the tires.

                        BRILL
            Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat.
            And turn your head. There might be
            some debris flying your way.

                        DEAN
            Why?

     And with that, THE FIRST WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, sending a
     fireball of debris in all directions.

                        DEAN
            What the fuck?!

                        BRILL
            They shouldn't have come without
            calling first.

     BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the
     engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas
     and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the
     warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a
     remote. The door rises.

     OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward,
     screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined
     with warehouses.

     DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a
     Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.

                        BRILL
            Where's your gun?

     They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns,
     heading straight at them.

                        DEAN
            Back at the warehouse.

     The Saturn pulls on the road behind them. The MAN in
     the Saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. The
     side window by Dean's head shatters.

     BRILL one-hands the pistol and checks the load.

                        DEAN
               (re: the pistol)
            Gimme that.

                        BRILL
            You sure?

                        DEAN
            You're driving.

                        BRILL
            Those are Feds.

                        DEAN
               (taking the pistol)
            I didn't see a warrant. Did you see
            a warrant?

     The Chevy enters a narrow lane, the Saturn right behind.
     With the Chevy's tires flat and flapping, the Saturn
     hugs their rear. DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN
     FIRES--

     The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three
     quick, well-placed rounds.

     The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.

     DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an
     iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster.
     Beam or no beam, he's going through.

                        BRILL
            Think we let out enough air?

                        DEAN
               (realizing)
            Oh my God...

     BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes
     just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the
     full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass,
     decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side
     minus roof and windows as--

     --the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and
     debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--

     --but the Chevy disappears around a building.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

     A foggy morning. The rural highway's deserted at this
     early hour. The Chevy rumbles by...

     INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN and BRILL, windblown but alive, remove shards of
     glass. BRILL eyes the road behind him.

     Empty.

                        BRILL
            We lost 'em.

                        DEAN
            That wasn't so hard.

                        BRILL
            Fuckin-A.

                        DEAN
            Let's not do the tire thing anymore,
            okay?

                        BRILL
            Yeah, I can see where that'd--

     He stops talking.

     He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears
     over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down.

     BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as
     BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-
     plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims
     with an M-16.

     A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the
     Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.

                        BRILL
            These guys are incredibly persistent.

                        DEAN
            Tell me about it.

     The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel.

     More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts
     hissing. The Chevy starts dying.

     BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick
     of horsepower.

     Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly.

     The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.

     INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

     The SHARP-SHOOTER lines DEAN in his sights.

     The PILOT keeps pace, dropping closer. The SHARP-
     SHOOTER has the shot.

     The Chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking,
     screeching wheel rims.

     The helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.

     But not the power lines. The PILOT sees them too late.
     The helicopter flies into a web of cables. The upper
     rotor slices neatly off. The helicopter's body rockets
     downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a
     rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck
     head-on.

     BLAM!

     EXT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't
     work. The car shimmies like it's on ice. Sparks fly as
     they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.

     INT. DODGE - CONTINUOUS

     A GRUNGE-DUDE blasts his car-stereo as he enters the
     tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him.

     He slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead.

     Closer, he sees DEAN waving him down. He slows more.
     Bad move.

     BRILL opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his
     pistol at the GRUNGE-DUDE's face.

     DEAN leaps in front.

                        BRILL
            Drive.

                        DEAN
            We're not gonna hurt you.

                        BRILL
            Drive.

                        DEAN
            Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.

                        BRILL
            Drive or I'll blow your fuckin'
            head off.

                        DEAN
            No he won't.

                        BRILL
            Goddammit--

                        DEAN
            We're honest people and we need
            your help. I'll give you two-
            hundred dollars if you--

                        GRUNGE-DUDE
               (leaping out)
            Take it!

                        DEAN
            Actually, I don't have two-hundred
            dollars.

                        BRILL
            Drive the damn car!

     DEAN slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear
     and goes.

     The Dodge erupts from the tunnel.

     Up ahead, the Saturn and another car approach fast in
     the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening.
     The car's fly by, unaware of DEAN and BRILL passing in
     the Dodge.

     The Dodge continues on, fading into the fog.

     INT. NSA/CORRIDOR - DAY

     REYNOLDS and HICKS walk down a white hallway three
     football fields in length, filled with bustling
     employees conservatively dressed.

                        HICKS
            We found two sets of latent prints
            in the rubble of Brill's studio.
            One was Dean's. The other, we
            believe, belongs to Brill.

                        REYNOLDS
            We believe?

                        HICKS
            Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.

                        REYNOLDS
            Lyle?!

                        HICKS
            Yes sir.

                        REYNOLDS
            You're kidding me.

                        HICKS
            No sir.

                        REYNOLDS
            Dean's with Lyle.

                        HICKS
            And they have the video. That's
            confirmed.

                        REYNOLDS
            So they know everything.

                        HICKS
            If they've looked at the video.

                        REYNOLDS
            Oh, let's assume that they have.

                        HICKS
            If he's with Lyle it means he's got
            resources.

                        REYNOLDS
            Resources, that's a good point.
            He's got resources. All we've got
            is a six-hundred billion dollar
            organization! Now goddammit, Hicks,
            you find 'em. You find 'em and you
            end it now!

     REYNOLDS walks off leaving HICKS to ponder his fate.

     EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

     Establishing. Plastic flags and PRICES SLASHED signs
     are everywhere. A blue Taurus pulls off the lot...

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            We'll take the tape directly to CBS.
            I'll hand it directly to the News
            Department.

     INT. TAURUS - CONTINUED

                        BRILL
            Listen to you, "directly". You're
            not gonna get near the News
            Department. And if you did, it'd
            never get on the air. Time-Life
            buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.

                        DEAN
            What about newspapers and magazines?

                        BRILL
            Same thing?

                        DEAN
            So what do we do now?

                        BRILL
            I was thinkin' about asking for my
            hundred and fifty grand and calling
            it quits.

                        DEAN
            What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.

                        BRILL
            It'd never get through. All
            packages are screened, x-rayed and
            then hand-searched for explosives.
            You didn't like my "give-me-my-
            money" idea?

     INT. TAURUS - NIGHT

     BRILL drives. DEAN thinks.

                        DEAN
            What if we hand deliver to their
            homes or office?

                        BRILL
            The area's wired for surveillance,
            they'll be looking for those moves.

                        DEAN
            Well how do I know what they're--

                        BRILL
            I know. I know what they're looking
            for and I'm telling you.

     The car radio is playing a newscast...

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
               (from the radio)
            --after which, Senator Albert will
            address a fund-raiser at Boston
            University.

                        DEAN
            What if we put it on the internet?

                        BRILL
            Have you seen how fuckin' slow the
            net is? It'd take ten minutes to
            unload enough video so that people
            know what they're seeing, and it'd
            take the NSA maybe 40 seconds to
            see it coming down and shut down
            the access.

                        NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
               (from the radio)
            --this will be the last stop on the
            Senator's eight-city tour before
            the Senate votes on Tuesday.

                        BRILL
               (reconsidering)
            But maybe if there were no phone
            line--

     DEAN has started listening to the radio...

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            What if we transmitted it over
            cellular?

                        DEAN
            Listen--

                        BRILL
            Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            If they couldn't do that, they'd
            shut down the whole system, all the
            relays.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            They've done it before. Takes maybe
            two minutes.

                        DEAN
            What if--

                        BRILL
            What if what?

                        DEAN
            What if we just fucked with 'em?

                        BRILL
               (pause)
            How?

                        DEAN
            Same way they did with you and me.
            We take their biggest guy and turn
            him into one of us.

                        BRILL
            Reynolds.

                        DEAN
            No.

                        BRILL
            Who?

     A MONTAGE OF EVENTS:

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     BRILL educates DEAN on simple ways to alter one's
     appearance.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Senator Sam Albert, senior
            Republican. Very well respected.

     INT. BOSTON UNIVERSITY/AUDITORIUM - DAY

     A large auditorium. Preparations are being made for
     Senator Albert's upcoming speech. BRILL and DEAN
     casually case the area for vulnerabilities.

                        DEAN
            We'll play the NSA's game only
            we'll play it badly.

     EXT. LE MERIDIAN HOTEL, BOSTON - DAY

     Establishing. A five-star hotel overlooking
     Massachusetts Bay.

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            You wanna get caught spying on Albert?

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            No, I want the NSA to get caught
            spying on Albert.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     CHRISTA HAWKINS, late 20's, the Senator's advance-
     person, stands at registration securing rooms for her
     boss and his team.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            We're gonna lead Albert by the nose
            to one conclusion. And then when
            he's pissed as hell, we're gonna
            drop the tape in his lap. How fast
            can you teach me what I need to know?

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            How fast can you learn?

     Next to CHRISTA, looking conservative and altered in
     appearance, is DEAN, eavesdropping on the Senator's
     room numbers and any other pertinent info.

     EXT. RADIO SHACK - DAY

     Establishing. One of those cheesy places in a mini-mall.

                        DEAN (V.O.)
            Pretty fast.

                        BRILL
            We'll have to re-stock some basics.

     INT. RADIO SHACK - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL and DEAN go shopping.

                        BRILL
            Bugs, frequency scanners, contact
            mics, transmitters, pin-holes,
            fiber optics--

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn. Devices cover the table and bed.

                        BRILL
            What do you know about locking
            cellular phone signals?

                        DEAN
            I know my phone number and I know
            the number for SportsPhone. Beyond
            that--

                        BRILL
            Shit.

     INT. TAURUS - DAY

     DEAN drives while BRILL sits with his open PC lap-top
     connect to his cellular phone.

                        BRILL
            A 'modified' OKI 900 interfaced
            with a lap-top creates an enormously
            powerful tool.
               (referring to the cell-phone)
            I got into the software, did some
            code re-writing and turned it into
            one of the best scan-looking
            systems around.

     CLOSE ON SCREEN - A street map appears with positions
     of the network's relays. Lines appear indicating all
     in-progress cellular calls along with their locations.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            This is every call on the grid. I
            can lock and position any one I
            want and follow the hand-offs in
            real time.

     BRILL punches a number into the cellular and the phone
     locks on the signal. Through the lap-top, we hear
     RINGING and then an ANSWERING VOICE.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Super Shuttle.

                        MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            This is Dr. Jonathan Phillips, 102
            Stern Drive in Brockton. I need an
            airport ride on Friday at 6 PM with
            a return pick-up Monday at 5.
            There'll be two of us and--

                        BRILL
               (disconnecting)
            Need a place to stay for the
            weekend? A new TV?
               (BRILL has repeated the process)

                        ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Triple-A Emergency Road Service.
            May I have your name and membership
            number?

                        YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Colleen Crane. Card number 020-113--

                        DEAN
            Unbelievable.

                        BRILL
            All from a hundred dollar scanner
            at Radio Shack. But it's time for
            business.

     BRILL dials his computer into a new line. TONES and
     COMMANDS fly quick as Brill's computer modems into another.

                        DEAN
            What are you dialing?

                        BRILL
            AmeriTech's data-base.
               (pointing on the screen)
            There's Albert's D.C. office
            address and his phone's identity
            code. Now we just reprogram out
            phone with his ID code and you know
            what we've got?

                        SENATOR ALBERT (O.S.)
               (mid-conversation)
            --Don't think it could've gone any
            better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're
            my grandchildren?

                        BRILL
            A receiver tuned permanently to the
            Senator's phone.

     EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

     A customized RV zips down the highway.

                        SENATOR'S WIFE (O.S.)
            Melissa has a fever. When will you
            be in the room?

     INT. RV - CONTINUOUS

     It's a plush affair befitting the Senator's position.
     ALBERT speaks in the cellular phone while an aide,
     PATRICK, reviews last minute changes for Albert's
     upcoming speech.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Not 'till later tonight. We're
            going to the campus now.
               (beat)
            I'll call you after I've checked in.
               (beat)
            I love you too, dear.

     INT. LE MERIDIAN HOTEL/LOBBY - DAY

     CHRISTA stands at the front desk as the CLERK hands her
     several faxes.

     DEAN, disguised, sits across the lobby reading a paper.

     DEAN's POV: CHRISTA exits the hotel to a waiting car.

                        DEAN
               (into concealed sleeve mic)
            She just left.

     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Numbered doors on each side. BRILL walks down the hall,
     hair slicked, mustache, wearing a suit and carrying a
     briefcase.

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            The important thing about
            installations is numbers.

     INT. CHRISTA'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     SERIES OF SHOTS:

     BRILL entering CHRISTA's room and opening his briefcase
     revealing tools and listening bugs.

                        BRILL (V.O.)
            They may find one, but they're not
            gonna find 'em all.

     --BRILL planting devices behind the headboard--

     --Inside the telephone--

     --Behind the desk--

     --Inside the TV--

     --BRILL rifling through CHRISTA's personal items,
     eyeing paper work, photographing interesting documents.

     --BRILL opening a connecting door, picking a second
     lock, and entering the adjoining suite.

     INT. CHRISTA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     A clock reads 1:28 AM. The lights are on and the bed
     unslept in. Christa's not seen. Then the connecting
     door opens--

     CHRISTA steps from the Senator's adjoining suite in a
     silk robe, nothing underneath. She turns in the doorway,
     revealing ALBERT, naked in a towel.

     CHRISTA closes the door, climbs in bed and grabs the
     remote. She clicks on the TV.

     FEEDBACK SCREECHES from the set.

     She tries changing channels but the SCREECHING
     continues. She tries turning off the set, but it won't
     turn off. She grabs the phone and dials.

                        CHRISTA
               (into phone)
            Can you send someone up right away.
            I'm having a problem with my TV...
            It's screeching and I--
               (beat)
            It's screeching and I--

     CHRISTA is noticing that her voice is causing the TV
     image to distort in sync.

                        CHRISTA (CONT'D)
            It's screeching and I can't turn it
            off.

     INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - MORNING

     SENATOR ALBERT dines with an aide as PATRICK approaches,
     a grave look on his face. PATRICK takes a seat.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            What happened to you last night?

     PATRICK reaches in his case and pulls out one of
     Brill's listening bugs and hands it to ALBERT who puts
     on his eyeglasses.

                        PATRICK
            Christa found it last night
            attached to her TV. It's a
            listening device.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            A bug?

                        PATRICK
            Yeah.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Jesus H.--

                        PATRICK
            We should everything checked.
            There's a company in Cambridge
            called Baudmore. They're discreet.

     Seated next to ALBERT's table is DEAN, unnoticed as he
     sips coffee, skims news, and eavesdrops on their
     MURMURS with a small, concealed parabolic mic and ear-
     phone.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Well get somebody down here today.
            I don't know what the hell this is
            all about.

     EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

     A phone distribution box is open, revealing a mass of
     circuit boards. BRILL stands at the box holding a
     circuit-dialer phone to his ear.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY/NEWS STAND - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN watches PATRICK approach a pay phone.

                        DEAN
               (into sleeve mic)
            He's going into the payphone
            outside the restaurant. It's a
            Cambridge company called Baudmore.

     BRILL connects two alligator clips to a line inside the
     box.

                        BRILL
               (into sleeve mic)
            Got it.

     BRILL's phone line immediately rings. He waits...then
     answers.

                        BRILL
               (into phone)
            Baudmore Consultants.

                        PATRICK
            Is Jerry Delsano in?

                        BRILL
            Who's calling?

                        PATRICK
            It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator
            Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's
            name.

                        BRILL
            Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I
            can give him the message when he
            gets back. That was Patrick and the
            last name--

                        PATRICK
            The thing is...it really can't wait.

                        BRILL
            My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.

     INT. SENATOR ALBERT'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE ON A FREQUENCY COUNTER sweeping a chest of
     drawers. The device starts BUZZING, indicating a
     transmitter.

     BRILL, disguised, is on hands and knees, searching
     under a chest where he 'discovers' a bug he planted
     earlier.

                        BRILL
               (removing the transmitter)
            Oh yeah. Got another one here.

     BRILL shows it to PATRICK, a very embarrassed HOTEL
     MANAGER and a very serious HEAD OF HOTEL SECURITY.

                        BRILL (CONT'D)
            Nasty fella. A TX-703. Remote on-
            off, three-thousand foot range.
            Shit, you could listen from a
            shopping mall across the street.

     INT. SENATOR ALBERT'S RV - DAY

     BRILL stands in front of SENATOR ALBERT.

                        BRILL
            Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as
            simple as that. Your average
            newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or
            whatever, they can't buy this stuff.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Well then who can?

                        BRILL
            Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me
            to say.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            What do you mean? Who can buy this
            kind of equipment.

                        BRILL
            The thing is, Senator, and I don't
            want to get in the middle of
            nothing, but--

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            What are you saying?

                        BRILL
            Most of this stuff's only available
            to law enforcement.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Law enforcement?

                        BRILL
            FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Are you sure about this?

     BRILL unwraps a towel revealing the grease-covered NSA
     tracker he removed from Dean's BMW.

                        BRILL
            I yanked this off your RV. It's a
            Global Positioning Tracker.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            Oh my God.

                        BRILL
            Tracks your location to the inch
            and works directly with--you know...

                        SENATOR ALBERT
            With what?

                        BRILL
            With spy satellites. I don't like
            saying these things Senator...

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (shaking BRILL's hand)
            Neil, thank you for your help.

                        BRILL
            Anytime.

     PATRICK escorts BRILL out of the RV.

     The SENATOR, fuming, opens a book, looks up a phone
     number and punches it into his phone.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (into the phone)
            This is Sam Albert. Put me through
            to Langley. Dick Marshal's office.

     INT. UNIVERSITY COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A place packed with STUDENTS, computers and TEACHERS.
     DEAN sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's
     really watching is--

     A WELL-DRESSED MAN at the counter, his back to DEAN,
     ordering a cup of coffee.

     The MAN glances at DEAN off the mirror behind the counter.

     BRILL walks in and joins DEAN.

                        BRILL
            Albert's primed. We'll let him stew
            for a day and then drop the tape.

     BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN.

                        DEAN
            He came in four minutes ago.

                        BRILL
               (pause)
            C'mon.

     They're about to start for the front door when an
     unmarked police car pulls up in front.

     A rowdy group of FRAT BOYS flood in, loud and busy. By
     the time they pass, BRILL and DEAN are gone.

     The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the
     back door swinging shut.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley
     and over a fence to another street. They slow as they
     approach the parked Taurus. BRILL takes the wheel with
     DEAN beside him.

     They pull into traffic. Things look good, but then the
     UNMARKED CAR and a SQUAD CAR scream up behind, lights
     flashing.

     INT. TAURUS - CONTINUOUS

     BRILL dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes
     alive.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

     A COP picks up the radio-mic.

                        COP
            One-Lincoln-Nine. In pursuit of two
            suspects, one matching description
            of Robert Dean, wanted in connection
            with a homicide. Suspects northbound
            on--

     EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS

     Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a
     one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar
     into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at
     his best, putting distance between himself and the cops
     at every turn.

     Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race
     down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.

     BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires
     smoking.

     Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing
     them in.

     BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end
     and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL
     gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and
     hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing
     wall.

                        BRILL
            Feeling lucky?

                        DEAN
            Not particularly, no.

     They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at
     the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the
     car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled
     with coal.

     They aren't going anywhere.

     Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.

     A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his
     gun and nears...

     Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam
     hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.

     DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He
     barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.

     His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,
     which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.

                        DEAN
            Shit.
               (to BRILL)
            I'm stuck. Help me out.

     He looks back to see that BRILL is hanging out the
     driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.

                        COP
               (on waist radio)
            One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA'd
            into a coal car at the Fullbright
            rail-yards. Requesting back-up,
            fire and ambulance.

     An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-
     yard and stops. The ROOKIE turns as JONES and KRUG hop out.

                        JONES
               (flashing ID)
            FBI. What do you got?

                        COP
            Two murder suspects. One's wounded,
            the other's maybe dead.

                        JONES
            Thank you.

     KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly
     shoots the COP dead.

                        JONES
               (to KRUG)
            Check inside.

     DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to
     dig himself out of the coal.

     KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of
     interest. JONES scans the area.

                        KRUG
               (to BRILL as he searches.)
            I hate doin' cops, I really do. You
            I won't mind. Didn't mind that
            Rachel Banks. Didn't mind doin' her
            one bit.
               (seeing DEAN's shoe)
            Your lawyer friend buried over there?

     BRILL can only gurgle blood. JONES pops the Taurus's
     trunk had looks inside.

     KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for
     Dean. Then BRILL sees him--

     BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car,
     lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG
     discovers he's not in the car.

     BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.

     JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the
     unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.

     KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches
     with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.

                        KRUG
            Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes.
            Find Dean.

     JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's
     cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.

     KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.

     Shit.

     BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes,
     consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown
     off his feet from the concussion.

                        JONES
               (scrambling away)
            Fuck--

     JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and
     tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach.

     DEAN watches from the shadows as flames incinerate
     everything.

                        MARSHAL (V.O.)
            I just came from my office at
            Langley. Senator Albert called me
            there.

     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. RESTAURANT TERRACE - DAY

     MARSHAL and SHAFFER dine with REYNOLDS at a restaurant
     overlooking the Potomac.

                        SHAFFER
            I got the same call at the Bureau.
            He's upset.

                        REYNOLDS
            About what?

                        MARSHAL
            About what? Do I look stupid?

                        REYNOLDS
            Ken--

                        MARSHAL
            Does Shaffer look stupid to you?

                        SHAFFER
            We're not stupid, Reynolds.

                        MARSHAL
            The fuck do you have goin' on with
            Sam Albert?

                        SHAFFER
            This guy's carrying the flag for
            the damn terrorism bill. You think
            this is the best time to piss him off?

                        MARSHAL
            You have any idea what kind of
            position this--

                        SHAFFER
            He's carrying the damn flag.

                        REYNOLDS
            We're not doing anything with Sam
            Albert.

                        MARSHAL
            He thinks we're stupid.

                        SHAFFER
            He found an NSA SAT tracker on his
            motor home today.

                        REYNOLDS
            It's not ours.

                        MARSHAL
            It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.

                        SHAFFER
            I don't know what's going on, but
            if you people have tripped over
            your own asshole again, you're not
            gonna get any help from us. It's
            ending at your doorstep.

                        HICKS (V.O.)
            Brill's dead.

     INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

     REYNOLDS rides in the back of the car, a cellular to
     his ear.

                        REYNOLDS
            What about--

                        HICKS (O.S.)
            We don't know.

                        REYNOLDS
            Explain that.

     INTERCUT WITH:

     INT. TECH ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The room is crammed with people as HICKS talks over the
     phone.

                        HICKS
            Jones had to flee the scene before
            we could locate the second body.

                        REYNOLDS
            What about the tape?

                        HICKS
            We think it was on Brill. If it was,
            it's destroyed now.

                        REYNOLDS
            And if it wasn't?

     ORGAN MUSIC can be heard as REYNOLDS snaps his phone shut.

                        PRIEST (O.S.)
            Peace be with you.

     EXT. SAINT PAUL'S CHURCH - DAY

     Establishing. A beautiful church in an expensive
     neighborhood.

            And also with you.

     INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

     A crowded Catholic mass. The PRIEST delivers a sermon
     from an altar decorated with Christmas candles and
     evergreen.

                        PRIEST
            The Lord said: I leave you peace,
            my peace I leave you. Let us now,
            in the spirit of these holidays,
            turn to our neighbors and offer
            them a sign of peace.

     REYNOLDS stands in a pew beside his TWO DAUGHTERS and
     his WIFE. He turns to those immediately around him,
     shaking their hands.

                        REYNOLDS
            Peace be with you...Peace be with you.

     A disguised DEAN takes REYNOLDS hand and shakes it...


                        DEAN
            Merry Christmas. It's me.

                        REYNOLDS
            Do I know you?

                        DEAN
            I'm Robert Dean. Within twelve
            hours, you're gonna be in jail.
            Peace be with you.

     REYNOLDS is dumbstruck...

                        PRIEST
            Let us now offer up thanks to the
            Lord our God in the words our
            Father gave us.

            Robert, is it safe to be talking on
            the phone like this?

     INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     DEAN sits on a bed while talking into a modified
     cellular computer. The screen shows his current call
     signal re-routing between relay stations.

                        DEAN
               (into phone)
            I've re-routed the call. They can't
            trace it.

            They're saying you killed that
            policeman.

            I can't tell you that.

     EXT. KENT ISLAND - CONTINUOUS

     Re-establishing. A concrete building rising from the woods.

            Can you tell me anything?

     INT. CEMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREENS showing hundreds of phone
     numbers scrolling by. A massive vacume cleaner of every
     cellular call being made in the state of Maryland. The
     computer scans for trigger numbers or words.

                        DEAN (O.S.)
            I can tell you this: That anti-

            up about? I don't think it's gonna

     HICKS is on the phone.

                        HICKS
            Found him. Kent Island nailed the
            call five minutes ago. He's stationary.

                        REYNOLDS
            Do you have visual?

                        HICKS
            Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th.
            I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene
            now. A residential building. Twelve
            units.

            What's your ETA?

            Three minutes. We're going in light.
            Myself and two others. Everyone
            else is held back in reserve.

     EXT. A VICTORIAN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     Establishing. Peaceful street, quaint apartments. THREE
     MEN stroll to the entrance of a well-maintained
     building. One jimmies the lock and a moment later
     they're in.

     INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     HICKS, JONES and DAVIS prepare. All have miniature
     earphones. DAVIS checks his silenced pistol. HICKS
     activates a frequency locator. The needle snaps on. He
     looks at DAVIS and JONES.

     They're ready.

     All hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the
     staircase.

     One flight, two. Then HICKS stops. The needle says
     they're close.

     HICKS motions. Their target's on two. They move down
     the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a TV
     SHOW drifting from an apartment.  Someone's up at this
     hour.

     They move on. HICKS watches the needle as it moves. He
     motions DAVIS and JONES to a door. JONES puts a
     reverse-viewer against the peep-hole.

     JONES's POV: A view of an entryway and living room. A
     light bleeds from an O.S. source. Beyond that there's
     no sign of life.

     HICKS puts a contact-mic against the door and listens
     to FAINT CONVERSATION somewhere inside, possibly the
     phone call. HICKS nods to JONES who quickly picks the
     lock while DAVIS eyes the hall.

     After a nervous moment, the door opens and HICKS, JONES
     and DAVIS enter.

     INT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     They spread out, searching the well-decorated condo for
     the target.

     They near the room with light. Using a mini-mirror,
     HICKS looks around the bend to see--

     A BEDROOM. There's a briefcase on the bed.

     They enter.

     From the bathroom they hear sounds of RUNNING WATER.
     They slowly approach. Wood again CREAKS beneath them.

     DEAN's VOICE is heard through the locked door.

     HICKS signals "on three".

     He counts, and they SMASH the door open to see--

     --a cellular phone taped to a Baby-Monitor. DEAN's
     nowhere in sight.

                        HICKS
            The fuck is this?

     INT. POLICE STATION/DISPATCH AREA - NIGHT

     Spinning banks of reporters manned by POLICE DISPATCHERS.
     We move to one desk where a phone rings.

     An LED immediately displays the caller's name; KRUGER,

     birth.

                        DISPATCHER

            My name's Jack Kreuger, I'm at 1102
            Grambling. I just saw three guys
            break into the condo next door. It
            looked to me like they had guns.

     INT. VICTORIAN BUILDING'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN has the phone circuit box open and is plugged in
     with a phone-line. Over the phone's mouthpiece, he
     holds an electronic Voice-Mask which alters his voice
     into an old man's.

                        DISPATCHER (O.S.)
            We'll send a unit over there now.
            If it's safe, sir, we'd like you to
            stay by your phone.

                        DEAN
            Yeah, I think I'll stay where I am.

            Any available unit. Armed 549 in
            progress.

     INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

     Three TECHNICIANS overhear the police radio call.

                        DISPATCHER (O.S.)
            Three suspects now inside. 1102
            Grambling, apartment 302.

                        TECHNICIAN
            Shit.
               (into radio)
            201 to First Team. Pull out. We got
            the cops.

     INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     HICKS spins and heads for the door. DAVIS hits it first.
     He grabs the doorknob and pulls--

     --and the knob rips from the door, trailing small wires.

                        DAVIS
            Fuck me!

                        JONES
            What'd you do?

                        DAVIS
            It came off in my hand!

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

     TWO SQUAD CARS come rolling up and FOUR COPS get out
     and head into the building.

     INT. THE APARTMENT

     JONES is trying to pry the door open with his fingers.
     No use.

                        TECHNICIAN
               (over radio)
            Get outa there, guys!

     While JONES continues on the door, DAVIS runs to the
     window.

     Throughout this, HICKS will stand in the middle of the
     room and, simply, oddly, stare at the mantle over the
     fireplace.

                        DAVIS
            Goddamit!

     HICKS smiles...and now he starts laughing a little...

                        JONES
            What's so fuckin' funny?

     HICKS motions to a framed picture over the fireplace.

                        HICKS
            It's over. We've been fucked with
            our pants on.

     The framed picture is of Senator SAM ALBERT and CHRISTA
     HAWKINS.

                        HICKS (CONT'D)
            We broke into her condo.

     DOOR WOOD EXPLODES inward. The TWO COPS roll in
     crouched positions, weapons drawn.

                        COP #1
            POLICE! FREEZE!

     HICKS doesn't move, DAVIS freezes like a deer in
     headlights, JONES stares with cold, dead eyes.

                        COP #2
            DROP THE WEAPONS! NOW!

     Two more COPS arrive. JONES and DAVIS drop their guns.

                        COP #1
            ON THE GROUND! NOW! FACE THE FLOOR!

     They do so. COPS THREE and FOUR go room to room making
     sure no one else is lurking. In the bedroom, they find
     the briefcase. Inside the briefcase--

     --listening bugs, installation equipment and
     compromising photos of the Senator with Christa.

                        CHRISTA (O.S.)
            Oh my God! What's going on?!

     Back in the living room, CHRISTA has walked through the
     broken-in apartment door to see JONES, HICKS and DAVIS
     lying on the floor at gun point.

                        COP #2
            Ma'am, is this your apartment?

                        CHRISTA
            What happened?!

                        COP #1
            Would you step out in the hallway
            for a moment, ma'am.

                        CHRISTA
            Oh God.

                        COP #2
            Please. We'll be right with you.

     CHRISTA backs slowly out of the apartment and into--

     INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     CHRISTA holds her hand over her mouth and is shaking. A
     VOICE comes from an alcove...

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            Christa?

     She turns. DEAN steps out from the alcove.

                        DEAN (CONT'D)
            You got a second?

                        CHRISTA
            Who are you?

                        DEAN
            My name's Robert Dean.

     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET IN CHEVY CHASE - NIGHT

     An up-scale neighborhood. Two inexpensive cars that
     don't seem to belong there sit in front of a large home.

     INT. SENATOR ALBERT'S PRIVATE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

     DEAN sits with a drink in his hand. Across from him are
     CHRISTA and PATRICK.

     They sit in uncomfortable silence for a moment before
     SENATOR ALBERT enters in bathrobe and pajamas.

                        ALBERT
            I understand we have a problem.

                        PATRICK
            Senator--

                        CHRISTA
            Senator, there were some things I
            couldn't tell you over the phone.

                        ALBERT
            What kinds of things?

                        PATRICK
            Mr. Dean has a video tape from the
            hotel room in Boston.

                        ALBERT
               (pause)
            I see.

                        DEAN
            It's actually DH-1 Digitech
            Pinpoint scanning with a frequency
            modulator.

                        ALBERT
            I don't know what that means.

                        DEAN
            Me neither, but the upshot is I've
            got color live-action footage of
            you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't
            look good.

                        ALBERT
            So...how much money do you want in
            exchange for not ruining my life?

                        DEAN
            I don't want any money. And believe
            me, I have no interest in ruining
            your life. I'm not interested in
            this tape.

                        ALBERT
            You're not.

                        PATRICK
            Then what do you want from the Senator?

                        DEAN
            I want him to look at a different
            tape. People have been killed.
            Lives have been ruined.
               (DEAN takes the computer
                chip from his pocket)
            Senator, I want you to look at this.
            And I want you to bring the fury of
            God himself upon this man.

     DEAN tosses the chip to ALBERT.

     INT. REYNOLDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

     REYNOLDS is asleep when the PHONE wakes him up. Once
     again, he reaches for his scrambled phone heads into
     the bathroom.

     After waiting for the signal that the line's clear...

                        REYNOLDS
            Yeah.

                        TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
            Sir, we've just intercepted an FBI
            communication.

                        REYNOLDS
               (into phone)
            Well...what is it?

                        TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
            Well, sir, it seems there's a
            warrant out on--

     The DOORBELL rings. REYNOLDS is alarmed.

     Now there's BANGING at the door and DOORBELL RINGS again.

                        REYNOLDS WIFE (O.S.)
               (from the bedroom)
            Who is that, dear?

     REYNOLDS snaps the phone shut and goes downstairs to
     the door.

     When he opens the door he sees TWO FBI AGENTS with
     their ID's flapped open and six uniformed POLICEMEN
     backing them up.

                        FBI AGENT
            John Reynolds?

                        REYNOLDS
            What the hell--

                        FBI AGENT
            You're under arrest. You have the
            right to remain silent. Anything
            you say--

                        REYNOLDS WIFE (O.S.)
               (from upstairs)
            Honey...?

     INT. DEAN'S STREET - MORNING

     A PAPERBOY tosses a newspaper at the Dean's door.

                        SENATOR ALBERT (O.S.)
            Privacy and the right to privacy is
            an inalienable right.

     INT. DEAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Stacy has C-SPAN on the TV while she makes breakfast
     for ERIC. SENATOR ALBERT is addressing the SENATE.

                        ERIC
            These guys are always making speeches.

                        STACY
            It's an important speech, Eric.
            There's gonna be a vote today.

                        SENATOR ALBERT
               (on TV)
            Today we face a threat to that
            creed. Certain individuals in our
            intelligence community believe
            they're entitled to examine lives
            in minute detail, and claim to do
            it in the name of the common good.

                        ERIC
            If they're voting today, hasn't
            everyone pretty much made up their
            minds.

                        STACY
            Actually, this man appears to have
            changed his mind dramatically.

                        ERIC
            Why?

                        VOICE (O.S.)
            He saw the light, my son.

     ERIC and STACY whip around--

                        ERIC
            Dad!

     STACY and ERIC run to DEAN...

                        STACY
            Is it over?

                        DEAN
            It's over.

                        ERIC
            How long can you stay?

                        DEAN
            I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I
            live here.

     ERIC and DEAN hug.

                        STACY
            Get ready for school, you're gonna
            be late.

                        ERIC
            Is it okay to use the phone now?

                        DEAN
            It's okay to use the phone.

                        ERIC
            Alright!

                        DEAN
            No "900" numbers.

     But ERIC has disappeared up the stairs...

                        STACY
            It's really over?

                        DEAN
            Albert's gonna get me my job back.

                        STACY
               (pause)
            I'm sorry about Rachel.

                        DEAN
            Yeah.
               (beat)
            I wish you could've met...

                        STACY
            Who?

                        DEAN
            A friend of mine. I don't know his
            real name. He's dead now.

                        STACY
            You did good.

     STACY points to the TV and DEAN watches for a moment...

                        ALBERT
               (on TV)
            I've lived through the dark ages of
            Hoover's Watch-List and McCarthy's
            Witch Hunts - men who used moral
            crusades, fired by fear, to lay
            waste to our freedoms.

                        STACY
            C'mon upstairs. I've got a
            Christmas present from Harrison's I
            want to show you.

     DEAN arrives as STACY takes him by the arm. They head
     upstairs as ALBERT continues on...

                        ALBERT
               (on TV)
            Our intelligence communities
            presently monitor our phones,
            computers, financial transactions,
            medical histories...all this and
            more. Some of you may say, "Fine.
            I'm not a criminal and I have
            nothing to hide." Well God forbid
            we ever edge to tyranny. God forbid
            George Orwell's version of America
            becomes a reality. We are that close.

     ALBERT's speech continues as we...

     ROLL END CREDITS.

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT

     Lake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic,
     minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of...

     ...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark
     up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can
     just make out...

     ...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel
     surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see...

     The THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored
     helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb-
     ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt.
     Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible?
     CLOSER still to see...

     ...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel
     to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the
     bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is
     remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision,
     until...

     ...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the
     100th floor.  Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures,
     in a cavernous coldly-decorated space.

     Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the
     steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner
     clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is
     placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the
     glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the
     rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and
     the window...

     ...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly
     sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind,
     and the Thief slips...

     ...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its
     60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief
     attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of
     possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until...

     ...the right one STOPS.  Illuminated in red.  The beeping, the
     green light, go OFF.  The device is removed.

     Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction-
     mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig
     in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling
     window pane.  A small remote control clicker...

     ...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now
     supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled
     INTO the apartment in a single tug.  The WHINE of a motor, and the
     pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place.

     No trace of entry.

     Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle,
     the Thief SCANS...

     ...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix,
     Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft
     lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity
     perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to
     end at the horizon.

     The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin-
     drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly
     through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German
     expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis
     Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE,
     we enter...

     ...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper-
     plated commode, and across from these...

     ...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master.
     A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient
     bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously...

     ...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes.
     Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube,
     pulling out...

     ...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this,
     fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame.
     Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor.
     Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube.
     Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement
     canvas...

     A cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown.

     WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is
     a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL.
     The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps...

     ...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating,
     and...

     Disappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating
     seamlessly into place.

     INT. VENT

     Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the
     narrow space, arriving at...

     ...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100
     floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly,
     the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from
     the backpack, and simply...

     LEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an
     instant...

     ...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place,
     suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the
     Thief...

     ...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL,
     until a cord is tugged and...

     ...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting
     lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for...

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER - LATE NIGHT

     Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE
     ANGLE now to see in far distance...

     ...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown
     Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering
     miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on...

     ...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit
     window to see...

     ...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP
     to...

     VIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the
     Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the
     Tower, to...

     The street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta.
     Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off...

     We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door
     OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it...

     Closes.  Softly.

     INT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - DAY

     A basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the
     bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell
     unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the
     hurried side of brisk.

     HECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat
     Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches.
     Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering...

     NO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle
     below the words.  He holds his hand up to it...

     Nothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased
     slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters...

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     An unexpectedly VAST semi-circular room, the entire inner circum-
     ference made up of a single continuous WALL SCREEN, separated into
     a seamless array of IMAGES...

     Three-dimensional rotating GRAPHICS of every room in the Hancock
     Tower Penthouse, SCHEMATICS of electrical, plumbing, and ventila-
     tion systems.  See-through rotating multicolored models of every
     piece of security EQUIPMENT imaginable, components FLASHING as
     performance simulations are run.  Rapid-fire sequences of indiv-
     idual human PROFILES, complete with photos and bio blurbs.  Screens
     flickering with blizzards of DATA, hurtling past at warp speed.

     The Pentagon and CNN would kill for this room.

     The largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a LIVE FEED
     from the crime scene.  The living room of the Penthouse, crawling
     with slow-moving cops and technicians, doing their slow-moving
     thing.  Surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing
     this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles.  All live.
     We see the library, the mail chute.  The powder room.  Bozo.

     Cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate CONTROL
     STATIONS, each outfitted with super-tech panels to process the
     avalanche of information.  But today, all stations are empty.

     Except one.

                               CRUZ
                     Baker.  You got it solved?

     And now we see her.  From the rear.  Slouched at her station.
     Looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled
     oversized workshirt, vintage jeans.

                               GIN (O.S., from the rear)
                     Actually.  Yeh.

     Not a kid's voice.  Throaty.  Music and whiskey and sex and
     effortless confidence.  Even the voice turns us on.

                               CRUZ (glances at his watch)
                     What took you so long, Gin?  I
                     called 4:30 this morn...

     And stops.  Because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone
     to stone.

                               GIN
                     I was with someone, all right?

     Now we really see her.  Delicate bones and features, slender body,
     radiating the power of a natural heart-stopping beauty.  GINGER
     BAKER is 32, ethereal and feral at once.  Electric green eyes
     crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked
     with.

                               CRUZ
                     So?  This is work.

     He is not kidding.  Stainless steel beneath the dapper.  They are a
     matched team.

                               GIN
                     Hector, I hardly know the guy.
                     Why be impolite to strangers?

     And he smiles.  Maybe she's lying.  He likes her.

                               CRUZ
                     Look at those assholes...

     He means the cops on live feed.

                               CRUZ
                     If the Vermeer were lying on that
                     table, they'd toss their doughnuts
                     on it.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, well, they didn't insure it,
                     so they don't have to solve this.
                     To them it's a crime.  To us it's 24
                     mil, less re-insurance, which is...

                               CRUZ (grim)
                     Only thirty percent, Gin.

     Ouch.  Really?

                               CRUZ
                     Which is why you're on this.

     Soft and straight.  You're the best.  I need you.

                               GIN
                     He came in through the window.

                               CRUZ
                     That's not possib...

                               GIN
                     What's not possible is entry through
                     the doors or the vents.  That would
                     have triggered instant alarm.

                               CRUZ
                     The windows are wired, too.

                               GIN
                     Only for trauma.  They used smart
                     glass, where the sensors respond to
                     violation of the panel's integrity.

     He's listening.  He always does with her.

                               GIN
                     I think he scaled the wall, popped
                     the frame.  In one piece.

     She sounds awfully positive.  Then again, she always does.

                               GIN
                     Then, he only had to deal with
                     heat and motion sensors.  They
                     were on 60-second delay, so the
                     owner wouldn't trigger the alarm
                     just be walking arou...

                               CRUZ
                     The pane weighs 200 pounds, the
                     building's 1100 feet high.

                               GIN
                     This particular guy is the best.
                     The best there ever was.

     Almost as if she knows who.  Cruz shakes his head...

                               CRUZ
                     Popping the frame would trigger
                     the alarm.

     She smiles.  First time.  Even at one-tenth power, it is dazzling
     light.  She touches the panel before her...

                               GIN (gently)
                     I wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo.

     The live feed is replaced by a red-outlined rotating three-
     dimensional DIAGRAM of the living room.  The alarm box glows green.
     One window pane glows lavender.  She touches the panel, and the
     window SHATTERS, the alarm instantly emits a PIERCING SCREECH.

     Reset.  As he watches.  This time the window SLIDES AWAY into
     thin air.  No sound.  A stick figure appears, crawls through the
     opening, and the alarm begins the slow BEEP we heard last night.
     Cruz just stares.

                               GIN
                     Here's how I figured it out...

     Live feed replaces the diagram.  Our camera ZOOMS toward a VASE of
     lilies by the window.  All the flowers are tilted in one direction.
     Over the lip of the vase, away from the window.

                               GIN
                     No one arranges flowers like that.
                     It was the draft from the window.

     He turns to her.

                               CRUZ
                     You said.  This particular guy.

     Now she is beaming.  Excited.  And just above a whisper...

                               GIN
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Delighted at his stupefied reaction.

                               CRUZ
                     Why not Houdini?  Or Pretty Boy
                     Floyd?  Maybe Jesus Christ.

                               GIN
                     Because they couldn't do it.

     His slow smile.  This fucking kid.

                               CRUZ
                     He's been out of the business.
                     For ten years.

                               GIN
                     Maybe not.  No one ever proved,
                     hell, even arrested him, for
                     stealing anything.  But we all
                     know he was numero ichiban for
                     thirty years.  Why not forty?

     She's serious.

                               CRUZ
                     Why?  Because of the Bozo switch?
                     Guys have been copying his pack-
                     rat signature for decades.  Maybe
                     the thief wanted it to look like
                     MacDougal.

     She doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of the
     data screens BLOWS UP to huge size.  It is...

                               GIN
                     A list of his private collection.
                     Complete to three acquisitions
                     last Thursday.

     Names SCROLLING up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions,
     estimated retail and black market values.  Turner, Corot, Thomas
     Coles, DeKooning, Klimt, Cezannes, Odilon Redon, Braques, Mary
     Cassatt...

                               CRUZ
                     No Vermeer.  Nothing close.

                               GIN
                     Don't be a putz.  This is his
                     legitimate collection, which he
                     buys.  Presentable for any search
                     warrant surprise party.

     Names keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee.  Amazing.

                               GIN
                     What he rips off, he fences.  And
                     the money feeds his portfolio of
                     investments, which are daring, savvy,
                     and obscenely succesf...

                               CRUZ
                     Oh, I get it.  He has no interest
                     in Vermeers, so that proves he stole
                     one.  By that logic, he oughta be a
                     suspect most of the time.

     She shakes her head, sadly.

                               GIN
                     You love to embarrass yourself.

     Touches her panel.  The big screen now shows a grainy VIDEOTAPE
     of...

                               GIN
                     The auction.  Where our client
                     bought the painting...

     We see the Great Room of an English Country estate.  Perhaps a
     hundred attend.  Genteel to the max.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire,
                     four weeks ago.

     The tape PANS five PAINTINGS on the block.  We recognize our
     VERMEER, the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge.  The view PULLS
     BACK to include the crowd, and...

     FREEZES.  One tiny section is circled.  And BLOWS UP twenty feet.
     high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable.  Then, SNAPS to amazing
     resolution.  The image of...

                               GIN (O.S., murmur)
                     Anyone we know?

     ...ANDREW MacDOUGAL, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly
     virile a face as one can recall.  Etched with character and worldly
     experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze.  Tall,
     wide shoulders, massive hands.  This guy would be more fun to fuck
     than fight.  By a lot.

                               CRUZ
                     So he was there.

                               GIN
                     Staking it out.  Why bid, when
                     you can mark the buyer, and jack
                     it within the month?

     She leans WAY back in the molded chair.  Lifts her long legs
     up onto the console.  They end in slender bare feet.  The toes
     wriggle.

                               GIN
                     At this moment, he is winging on
                     JAL flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly
                     to attend a prestigious auction at
                     the Hotel Akura, which will include
                     a mixed media collage/oil by Georges
                     Braques, on which he supposedly has
                     his eye.

                               CRUZ
                     But you know better.

                               GIN
                     Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds.

     Touches the panel.  The big screen now holds three faces, three
     names.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Research reveals three known fences,
                     still at large, who are believed
                     to have brokered Vermeers to black
                     market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is
                     hospitalized in Malta with ovarian
                     cancer.

     One face and name disappears.  Two remain.  KOICHI NARUHITO.
     HIROYUKI YAMAJI.

                               GIN
                     The other two.  Live in Tokyo.

     A tiny, dry, adorable, shrug.  Which says, bingo.

                               CRUZ
                     And you did all this since 4:30
                     this morning.

     Grinning small at each other.  She can't help that hers is hot.
     She never can.

                               CRUZ (murmur)
                     Plus.  You were polite to a
                     stranger.

     One of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to
     ignore.  Best to defuse by pretending it's a joke...

                               GIN (soft and playful)
                     Sounds like you're sorry you're
                     already a friend.

     Said as banter between pals.  Which doesn't make her wrong.

     INT. HOTEL OKURA, TOKYO - NIGHT

     Auction in progress in the huge traditional LOBBY, where bonsai
     trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint
     the sleek, international, big-money crowd.  Everyone milling,
     drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up
     on the raised platform...

     ...the AUCTIONEER has a new piece on the block, a 6th Century
     temple scroll, from the Asuka period.  It is exquisite, and bidding
     seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the
     overhead DIGITAL DISPLAY, which reveals bidding status in thirty
     currencies simultaneously. As we PAN the hall, we see...

     ...all non-Asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by
     personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid-fire
     auctioneer.

     Except one.

     ANDREW MacDOUGAL stands alone in black tie.  Tall and rugged and
     polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous.  He is bidding on
     the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and
     the repeated finger-stabs of the auctioneer in our direction.

                               WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S., subtitled Japanese)
                     Don't do it.

     PULL BACK slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder.
     She is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale
     golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly.  Breathtaking would
     be an insult.

     MacDougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her.  Just raises
     his program to up the bid.

                               GIN (softly, subtitled Japanese)
                     You're already over value.  By
                     15 percent.

     And now he turns.  Straight to her eyes.  This is NOT an admiring
     glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the Northern Hemisphere.
     It is a look that says, in the most understated terms, shut up or
     I'll kill you.  She shuts up.

     His glance goes to his obvious bidding RIVAL, a rather butch
     middle-aged Chinese woman in an embroidered version of a Mao suit.
     She indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny Yorkshire Terrier,
     whom she holds in her stubby hands.  MacDougal raises back.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Will you stop being stubborn
                     for one sec...

     And stops.  Because he has turned.  With the eyes of a lion.  Being
     pulled from an antelope carcass.

                               MAC (quietly, subtitled Japanese)
                     I have a question.

     Rich Scottish voice.  Impeccable Japanese intonation.

                               GIN (brightly, subtitled Japanese)
                     Who the fuck am I?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     That is of no interest.

     Oh.  In spite of herself, she looks a little hurt.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     What, then?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Why.  Are we speaking.  Japanese?

     Her eyes move across his formidable face.

                              GIN
                     Uh.  I'm showing off.

     His eyes scan the length of her gown.  Her body.

                               MAC
                     Something of a habit?

     She is minus a comeback.

                               MAC
                     You know the alleged value of this
                     piece from some fucking computer,
                     which has no clue of the price I
                     can turn the scroll around for in
                     30 minutes.

     A beat.

                               GIN
                     No, you can't.

     He blinks.  No?

                               GIN (really sorry)
                     It's sold.

     His great head WHIPS around to see Madame Mao KISSING her pooch,
     flushed with victory.  He stares for a long moment, a veneer of
     philosophical almost masking his rage.  When he turns back...

                               MAC
                     Are you a confederate of my
                     adversaries?  Or are you just
                     stupid.

     And walks.  Away.

     HOLD on her.  Feeling like both.

     EXT. HOTEL OKURA - NIGHT

     Mac among the guests awaiting their cars, standing slightly apart.
     From behind him...

     ...a feminine throat clears.  Nervously.  He closes his eyes for a
     beat.  Then, turns.

                               GIN (softly)
                     How about.  If I try humility.

     And presents a business card to him with both hands, Japanese-
     style.  Mac looks in her eyes.  Takes the card with both hands.
     Reads...

                               MAC
                     Virginia Romay...

                               GIN
                     Gin, actually, Gin Romay.  I
                     was named after a card game.

                               MAC
                     Or a cheap cocktail.

     She blinks.  His brows raise...

                               MAC (softly)
                     As in.  I'll have a Gin Romay,
                     please.  With a twist.

     That laser, unsmiling stare.  Beyond sexy.  She gets lost in it for
     a beat.

                               GIN
                     You're supposed to be charming.

                               MAC
                     I'm supposed to be selective.

     Glances back to her card.  Reads...

                               MAC
                     Art and Antiquities Acquisition
                     Advisor, how alliterative...

     Looks up.  Still no smile.

                               MAC
                     And am I the antiquity?

                               GIN
                     In mint condition.

     She sighs.  Achingly lovely.

                               GIN
                     Look, I've studied you, I know...
                     pretty much...everything.

     Do you.

                               GIN
                     Made your first millions selling
                     scrap metal.  Then, gold mining
                     concessions, gems, art, and lately
                     strategic metals for new technologies
                     - platinum, zirconium, titanium...

                               MAC
                     You said.  Everything.

     Huh?  Oh.

                               GIN
                     The cat burglar stories?  Why
                     would anyone...with so much to
                     lose...take those kinds of risks?

     Guileless smile.

                               GIN
                     You'd have to be.  Stupid.

     A held beat.  His glance lifts beyond her shoulder.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me.

     And walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up.
     She goes after him.

                               GIN
                     I didn't know Porsche made
                     things like this.

                               MAC
                     Well, they don't...

     Tipping the valet.  Sliding in...

                               MAC
                     ...as a rule.

     Shutting the door.  Through the open window, she hands something
     from her bag.  A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer.
     She presses the light ON.  He looks at the slide.

                               GIN
                     Recognize that?

     No reaction.

                               GIN
                     My seller is in Shinjuku, we can
                     go there tonight.

     She leans closer.

                               GIN
                     He wants 4.6 million.  I can
                     get it for three.

     He hands it back.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     No, you can't.

     And TAKES OFF.  Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion...

     She's hailed a cab.

     INT. IMPERIAL HOTEL BAR - LATER

     Graceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the
     '20s.  Burnished.  Elegant.  Way cool.  A place to drink, to deal,
     to dream.  PAN down the polished surface of the bartop, til we
     come to...

     ...a tropical DRINK.  Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the
     room.  ROTATE ANGLE to see...

     ...INSIDE the umbrella, something small, something mechanical.  A
     woman's HAND ADJUSTS the point of the umbrella ever so slightly,
     and we PAN UP her arm to see...

     ...Gin.  Still in her gown.  She is reading, with half-glasses, and
     one of the bows curls around her ear, which we CLOSE on to hear...

     ...static.  Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional
     mike, and hears...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...only it's not bloody football!

     SNAP to Mac's table, well across the room.  Drinking giant beers
     with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled,
     suit.  The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if
     he actually gave a shit.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...it's just that crap Americans
                     call 'football', like you could
                     call your ass a butterscotch scone
                     and have it be one!

     The guy nods seriously.  Maybe he's a Sumo dude.

                               MAC
                     Why you'd want to bring that
                     foolishness to Japan, you're
                     just pissing your investment
                     down a bungee hole.

                               SUMO GUY (major accent)
                     You got Cubano this trip?

     That he does.  Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it
     over.  Flat against one side is an ENVELOPE, which Sumo Guy PALMS
     skillfully, slipping it seamlessly INTO his pocket as he withdraws
     a small MATCH BOX.  Takes out one long cigar, lights up...

                               MAC
                     Seriously, put the money into
                     pharmaceuticals or prostitution,
                     something stable.

     The big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac.
     Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small MICROCHIP fastened
     to the cardboard.  Lights up.  Slides the match box in his pocket.

                               MAC
                     Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial
                     plastics.

     ANGLE...Gin still engrossed in her reading.  A figure leans down
     next to her.  She startles, slightly.  So surprised to see...

                               MAC
                     My favorite thing in life.
                     Coincidence.

     She gives him the great smile.

                               GIN
                     I'm staying here, what's your
                     excuse?

     And now he smiles.  First time ever.  A little chilling, the way he
     does it.

                               MAC
                     Staying here, as well.  You
                     are in room...?

                               GIN (half a beat)
                     One thirty-eight.

     In one motion, he flags the bartender...

                               MAC
                     Will you send a half-bottle of
                     Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138,
                     please?  And some berries and
                     chocolates for the lady to enjoy
                     it with.

     He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back...

                               MAC
                     Actually, I was just across the
                     room, dickering with a gentleman
                     over the purchase of an interesting
                     Spitzweg.  Until I determined the
                     painting was apparently stolen...

     Oh.   She's shocked.  He agrees...

                               MAC
                     Goes against my grain.  The
                     DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6
                     million you can get for 3.  Can
                     you get it for 2 and a half?

     She looks in his eyes.

                               GIN
                     Sure.

     And as if he believed her...

                               MAC
                     My checkbook is in my safe.  You
                     wait here.

     His smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say...

                               GIN
                     Okay.  I'll wait here.

     INT. CAR, SHINJUKU DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Mac driving in silence.  Gin stealing glances at him.  Suddenly and
     smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up...

                               GIN
                     That's my purse.

     He opens it.  One eye on the road, he begins to rummage...

                               MAC
                     Just want to see if I'm with the
                     person you say you are.  Can't be
                     too caref...

     She SNATCHES the bag away from him, he GRABS it back, the car
     SWERVES LEFT, and...

     ...CRASHES VIOLENTLY into a parked pure white Bentley.  Metal
     BUCKLES and TEARS, both ALARMS go OFF, a cacophony of horrific
     NOISE.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Oh, dear.

     People come RUNNING, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly
     COUPLE who were just returning to their precious Bentley.  Their
     WAILS and ANGUISH would be suitable if all their grandchildren had
     been crushed beneath Mac's wheels.

     Mac and Gin are OUT of the car.  As he exits, Mac has palmed a
     small BLADE, and in a quick unseen motion, RIPPED a jagged tear
     in his left trouser leg.  The old couple RUSH to Mac, SHRIEKING
     their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as
     bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     We'll go in there, and call
                     the police.

     And HOBBLES off toward the nearest building, a block-square
     30-story skyscraper bearing the name FUJITSU.  The couple, the
     crowd, all race after the limping Mac...

                               GIN
                     Are you all right?

     No answer, he looks dark enough to rain.  INTO the public lobby of
     the huge industrial complex.  Two night GUARDS come hurrying from
     their desk, as the small mob POURS in.  Mac in the lead, a
     commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     I have damaged the car of these
                     kind people.  Please help them
                     call the police...

     One guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone.  Mac pulls up
     his trouser leg, and Gin GASPS to see a bloody GASH.  Mac drops the
     trouser back over the wound.  Asks the remaining guard...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I use a washroom, please.

     The guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos.  Mac hands his
     billfold to Gin...

                               MAC
                     These are my papers, passport, car
                     registration.  If the police arri...

                               GIN
                     You're going to need stitches,
                     let me get you to a hospital.

     Soft words, genuine concern.  And his eyes flicker.  As if somehow
     seeing her for the first time.  A small spark, but she feels it.
     Softer still...

                               GIN
                     Really, this can all wait.
                     I'll handle it.

     The look holds.

                               MAC
                     That's actually.  Very sweet.

     His first real smile.  It was worth waiting for.

                               MAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese)
                     Might you have a First Aid kit,
                     of some kind?

     INT. TOILET STALL

     We are inside an empty, closed, Japanese-style toilet stall.
     Porcelain foot rests.  A hole.  The door BURSTS OPEN, and...

     ...Mac enters FAST with the First Aid kit, locking the door,
     hitting the STOPWATCH on his wrist, which begins counting at
     ZERO.  He pulls UP his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash,
     and simply...

     ...RIPS the entire wound OFF, the rubbery prosthetic wound DANGLES,
     dripping its phony blood.  Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit,
     SOAKS them in bogus gore, expertly WRAPS his leg, then FLUSHES the
     prosthetic DOWN the hole.

     He pulls off the FUJITSU VISITOR badge clipped to his lapel, and
     from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he PRESSES
     to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge
     into...

     ...an EMPLOYEE I.D., the name KAWAKUBO, M., the PHOTO of a surly
     Japanese male.  Quickly, Mac takes out the MATCH BOX from the hotel
     bar, and with a fine tweezers gently removes the MICROCHIP, placing
     it INSIDE the badge, activating it with a soft BEEP-BEEP.  He
     reaches now...

     ...behind his back, up UNDER his tux jacket, and RIPS FREE a
     tightly-compressed PACK of what seems white paper or cloth.  He
     SNAPS it loose, revealing it to be...

     ...a baggy CLEAN SUIT, not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to
     the floor...

     ...a white HOOD.  With opaque tinted VISOR.

     INT. SECURITY CORRIDOR

     Mac in his clean suit and opaque-visored hood at an elevator marked
     CLEARED PERSONNEL ONLY in English and Kanji (Japanese characters).
     He holds his badge to the SCANNER, the door PINGS and slides OPEN..

     INT. PREP ROOM ENTRANCE, 29TH FLOOR

     Mac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an AIR-LOCK with
     sign CLEAN ROOM - CLASS 10.  Holds his badge to the SCANNER, the
     air-lock door lights FLASH froin red to yellow to green.  He
     enters...

     ...the PREP ROOM.  Recorded VOICES purr safety instructions in
     Japanese, while Mac stands, being bombarded by air shower, chemical
     sprayer, blinding UV light.  The next air-lock OPENS.  He enters...

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     ...a long ASSEMBLY LINE, where ROBOT ARMS work on a stream of black
     SILICON WAFERS, which pass along a clear Lexan CONVEYOR BELT.  The
     wafers move through various airtight CHAMBERS, exposing them to
     multi-colored gasses, cyan, sodium yellow, magenta, etc., as part
     of the microchip manufacturing process.

     More than a dozen TECHNICIANS in their hooded clean suits watch
     over every phase of the work, attached to the walls by grounding
     wires and air hoses, which create a deafening NOISE.  Mac simply
     hooks himself up, and saunters straight THROUGH the area, toward
     the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed
     MICROCHIPS...

     ...DISAPPEARS through the wall.  Nearby, a HATCH is built into the
     same wall, and Mac calmly CLANKS it OPEN, squeezing through into...

     ...a dimly-lit MAINTENANCE BAY.  Panels of switches, wires, fuses,
     fans, air cleaners.  Maximum claustrophobia, as Mac CLANGS the
     hatch SHUT behind him, looking instantly to...

     ...an OVERHEAD HATCH with letters in Kanji and English, DANGER
     ARGON GAS.  Mac THROWS back his hood, YANKS out his mini oxygen
     pouch, fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils,
     and slips on thick round infrared GOGGLES that make him look like a
     refugee from 12 MONKEYS.  No time to lose...

     ...up THROUGH the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he
     enters...

     ...the conveyer TUBE, a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in
     diameter, filled with billowing red gas.  Mac stretches out on his
     belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its
     precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in
     eerie red light.  He begins to...

     ...shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube.  Gas too
     thick to see the end.  He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when
     suddenly...

     ...the floor beneath his tube FALLS AWAY, and he is crawling in
     space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance
     between manufacturing and shipping structures.  He goes faster,
     HARDER...

     INT. MICROCHIP VAULT

     A black chamber.  We can scarcely make out the endless rows of
     shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering
     through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip
     in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves.  Through the gasket...

     ...Mac TUMBLES into view, swinging himself neatly DOWN to the
     floor, and in a single motion, he is already FLASHING a neon-green
     pen light along the shelves of microchips.  We see now the wrappers
     are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is
     definitely looking for something special, until...

     ...he's found it.  A single row, 35 chips, nothing special from
     here, but Mac...

     ...WHIPS out something coiled, SNAPS it to full length, revealing a
     strip of shiny black SATIN CLOTH.  Three feet long, little more
     than an inch wide.  Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly
     OVER the row of microchips.  And when he lifts it UP again...

     ...the chips have ADHERED to the underside of the cloth.  In one
     deft SNAP of his wrist, he COILS the cloth again, like a yo-yo.
     Turns to leave, and...

     Oh, yeh.

     Tosses a small SACK of something where the chips used to be.  TIM'S
     CASCADE BRAND POTATO CHIPS.  SEA SALT AND VINEGAR FLAVOR.

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     Mac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the Clean Room.
     No one sees, no one cares.  Hooking up once again, he ambles toward
     a door clearly marked EXIT ONLY TO EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - RETURN ONLY
     THROUGH SECURITY AREA.

     By the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall.  He pretends
     to scan it.  A stack of flyers.  He takes one.  Exiting into...

     INT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

     Past a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting.  Mac
     just strolling along, reading his flyer, as...

     A hand.  Touches his shoulder

                               VOICE (subtitled Japanese)
                     Excuse me.

     Mac turns, stares through his opaque VISOR at a well-built SECURITY
     OFFICER.  Dead straight eyes.

                               OFFICER (subtitled Japanese)
                     The company picnic.  Saturday or
                     Sunday?

     His eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'.  Mac hands it to him,
     and without a trace of Scottish accent...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Better eat first.

     INT. GUEST LOBBY

     Gin is up to her ears in grief.  There are no less than five COPS
     grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second
     wind and are SHRIEKING in top form.  The bystander gallery has
     grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in.
     As Gin struggles to cope...

     ...she keeps looking at the clock.  Darting glances toward the
     corridor.  She is freaking out.

     Finally.  She can't stand it.  Hands Mac's billfold to one of the
     cops, pushes her way through the mob, and...

     ...TAKES OFF down the corridor, a security guard in belated
     pursuit, we go...

     ...WITH her DOWN the hallway, WHEEL around a corner, flat-out
     SPRINTING, SKIDS to a stop at the right doorway and BURSTS INTO...

     INT. MEN'S ROOM

     An empty washroom.  She listens.  Nothing.

                               GIN
                     Mr. MacDougal?  Sir?

     No sound.  Uh-oh.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Mr. Ma...

                               MAC (O.S., from the stall)
                     Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became
                     of a gentleman's privacy?

     The security guard BARGES IN.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     My God, more females?

     The guard starts railing at Gin a mile a minute.  She calmly takes
     a WAD of bills from her purse.  Hands them to the guy...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Stand outside.  That door.  Two
                     minutes...

     He does.  Alone again.

                               GIN
                     I was worried, it's been twenty...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Eighteen, actually.  The leg is
                     fine, but I got sort of...woozy.

                               GIN
                     Woozy.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Lost my stomach once or twice.

     CUT INSIDE the stall.  He is just re-taping the folded clean suit
     and hood to the small of his back.

                               MAC
                     I'm an old man.  You probably
                     noticed.

     Awkward silence.  He smiles at that, much amused.  Slips on his
     jacket.

                               MAC
                     You should see me without
                     my teeth.

     UNLOCKS the door.  Remembers...

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up.

     That's not what he forgot.  He pulls OUT the coiled black satin
     cloth strip, SNAPS it free, microchips snug to the underside.  And
     fits it neatly...

     ...DOWN his trouser leg.  The perfect tuxedo stripe.

     OUT the door.  To meet her gaze.

                               MAC
                     Odd place, this.

     He goes to her.  Offers his arm.

                               MAC
                     What do you suppose they make
                     here?  Video recorders?

     She takes it, wrapping both hers through.

                               GIN
                     Microchips, I think, for computers.

     He opens the door.  Ushers her through...

                               MAC
                     Bad investment.  The best ones
                     are here today...

     Follows her out...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Gone tomor...

     Closed door.  Quiet.

     INT. CAB, NIHONBASHI DISTRICT - NIGHT

     They sit together in the rear of the taxi, as it makes its way
     through late night traffic.  She is looking around.

                               GIN
                     This isn't the way to my sel...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I've changed my mind.

     Looking straight ahead.  Contemplative.  She stares at his
     profile...

                               GIN
                     Mind telling me why?

                               MAC
                     You can't get it for me at 2.5,
                     can you?

                               GIN
                     Well, we can tr...

                               MAC
                     You were setting me up.  The correct
                     price is 2.8.  You conspire with the
                     seller to start at 4.6, so I'll be
                     grateful when you 'bargain' him down
                     to three.  Close enough to fool some
                     people.  unfortunately...

     He sighs.  Never looks at her.

                               MAC
                     I'm old.  I know what everything
                     is worth.

     She keeps staring.

                               GIN
                     So where are we g...

                               MAC
                     I am going to the airport.  You
                     are going on to the rest of your
                     life.  Which...

     He thinks.  Admits...

                               MAC
                     ...should be interesting.

     Her turn to think.

                               GIN
                     You forgot your lugg...

                               MAC
                     The hotels deal with that.  The
                     things I need are always waiting
                     at the next one.
                               (afterthought)
                     I don't carry.  Baggage.

     Little twist on that.

                               GIN
                     Sensible.  And you're off to...?

                               MAC
                     Oh, that's highly personal.

     He still stares straight ahead.  The taxi pulls onto a freeway.
     Toward Narita Airport.  Time running out.  And in her dearest, most
     vulnerable, voice...

                               GIN
                     I did so hope to impress you.

     She puts the fingertips of her left hand.  On his chest.  A
     silence.  No reaction.

                               GIN (hopeful)
                     I'm still hoping...

     And he smiles.  Turns to her eyes.

                               MAC
                     Young lady.  I am old enough to
                     be your grandfather.

     She shakes her head.  Uh-uh.

                               GIN (soft)
                     My father.

     Leans her mouth in for the kill.

                               GIN (whisper)
                     That's part of the rush.

     And softly.  Fits her mouth to his.  The green eyes close, as
     she tastes him.  Nothing predatory in this kiss.  It is tender,
     exquisite.  A kiss of deep longing.  Of true love.

     His arms slip around her.  And in less than five seconds...

                               TAXI DRIVER (O.S., racist accent)
                     Still on fo' airport?

     Nobody.  Says.  Nothin'.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - LATE NIGHT

     A small bottle.  An ornate label.  Chateau d'Yquem '67.  Gin lifts
     it from the table, studies the label.  She wears only a man's
     oversized t-shirt.  Our rotating ANGLE reveals the empty bed,
     tangled sheets.  Gin looks pretty rumpled herself.

     She lifts the bottle, two glasses, a plateful of chocolates and
     strawberries, and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking...

     ...the TERRACE.  Mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing,
     overlooking downtown Tokyo.  He wears a thin Japanese robe called
     a yukata, and is wrapped in half of a huge down COVERLET from the
     bed.  The other half obviously waiting for...

                               GIN
                     Here.  A reward.

     She curls down into the billowing coverlet, just against his body.
     Sets her things beside him.

                               MAC
                     A reward for what?

                               GIN
                     For not being old.  After all.

     It is a lovely smile.  He studies it for a beat.

                               MAC
                     You mean.  Not as old as I look.

     She traces her finger along his cheek.

                               GIN (a whisper)
                     Yeh.

     And kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With
     him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back...

     ...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the
     larger piece.

                               GIN
                     Do I deserve a reward?

     No answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great
     tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows.

                               GIN
                     It's so hard to find good casual
                     sex, anymore.  I'm probably out
                     of practice.

     But he just looks at her.

                               MAC
                     What's hard to find.  Is someone
                     you truly want to be with.

     And leans closer.  Just above a whisper...

                               MAC
                     Even for awhile.

     He kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And
     when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for
     something to say.

                               GIN
                     It's lucky we stopped by my room,
                     for the wine.

     She swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not
     forgetting that she's changed the subject.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise, we'd never have found
                     my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow.

                               MAC
                     Would that make it more stolen?

     She smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe
     she's wondering if she actually likes him.

                               GIN
                     They even got my prescriptions.

                               MAC
                     Something you need? There are
                     all-night chemists...

     He does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose.

                               GIN
                     I take Prilosec.  For stomach
                     acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma.

     She gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease.

                               GIN
                     But since I didn't have to work
                     all that hard tonight...

     He stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her
     eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Ouch.  I had that coming.

     She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He
     wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close.

                               GIN
                     Why would someone steal my luggage?
                     Every guest in this place must
                     have more than a wannabe art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you
                     had something valuable in there.

     Something in the tone.

                               GIN
                     Such as...

                               MAC
                     Well.  Wannabe dealers make
                     excellent fences.

     A flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the
     humor.

                               GIN
                     He thought I had a stolen
                     painting.  In my bag.

                               MAC
                     I'm joking, of course.

     Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC
                     The Vermeer wouldn't fit.

     Her eyes widen.  Just a little.

                               GIN
                     Excuse me?

                               MAC
                     Why, did you do something wrong?

     She turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each
     reading the other's eyes.

                               GIN
                     You said.  Vermeer.

                               MAC
                     The most famous painting stolen
                     this week.

     His turn.  To kiss her nose.

                               MAC
                     If you don't keep up on your
                     craft.  You'll miss all the jokes.

     And lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he
     winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but...

     ...he fills it with his own.

     This conversation.  Is over.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING

     VIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe
     they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a
     distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see...

     Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly
     going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every
     goddam thing in the room.  She comes to...

     ...Mac's tux.  The jacket, rifles the pockets, pats the lining.
     The pants now...

     ...something peculiar. The right leg has no stripe. Touches the
     cloth.  Slightly sticky where the stripe should be.  Odd.

     ANGLE...the bathroom.  Shower running full BLAST.  But there's no
     one in it.

     ANGLE...a storage closet.  Mac crouching in the smallspace.  We
     see the travel bag.  The luggage tag, VIRGINIA ROMAY, a Darien,
     Connecticut address.  The embossed initials VR.  But there is
     something else in Mac's hand...

     ...a prescription bottle.  Prilosec.  And a name, GINGER BAKER.
     Chicago address.  Mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe...

     ...exits the closet.  Locks the door.

     ANGLE...Mac ambling into the bedroom, toweling his hair with one
     hand.  Holding his billfold in the other.  Gin is starting a room
     service breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, Belgian waffles.  The girl can
     eat.

                               MAC
                     I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo.

     She looks up.  Trademark dry grin...

                               GIN
                     I love a guy who knows how to
                     sweet talk.

     He stands over her.  Smiling.  What he meant was...

                               MAC
                     There was a call.  While you
                     were sleeping.

     A call.

                               MAC
                     An art dealer I know.  He has a
                     Monet.  Minor, but it is Giverny.
                     He'll let me have it for 5.3 million.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN (cautiously)
                     We can maybe beat that.

                               MAC (pulling plastic from his billfold)
                     I agree.  This is a bank debit card.
                     It gives the bearer access to an
                     account containing 4.6 and change.
                     I dislike round numbers.

     And hand. the card to her.  As her eyes move over it...

                               MAC
                     I'd like you to go down there,
                     and pick up the painting.  If
                     that's all right.

     Without looking up...

                               GIN
                     Me.

                               MAC
                     If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You
                     just hand him the debit card, with
                     that...luminous smile.  And say,
                     take it or leave it.

     Now her eyes come up.  She says nothing.  Hesitant.

                               MAC
                     Oh, dear.  I thought you so
                     wanted to make a good impression.

                               GIN
                     Thought I already did th...

                               MAC
                     And along with making an excellent
                     impression.  You will also make 2
                     percent of the purchase price.

     She blinks.

                               MAC
                     That's $92,000.  And change..
                     For two hours work.

     The look holds.  He goes to the desk.  Lifts a cellular phone.
     TOSSES it to her.

                               MAC
                     Any problems.  Just give me
                     a ring.

                               GIN
                     Stolen painting is it?

                               MAC
                     Of course not.

     And on his way out the door...

                               MAC
                     If it was.  I wouldn't pay more
                     than three.

     EXT. WHARF, YOKOHAMA - DAY

     Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund.
     Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle
     counters, all built along a tall rickety PIER nearly thirty feet
     above the pounding surf.  The harbor is gigantic.  Every type and
     size of vessel imaginable.

     Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and
     a lightweight bright orange foam cover.  She looks at her slip of
     paper.  Then across at the place...KENDO SOUVENIRS, a schlock
     kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front.

     This can't be right.  Pulls out the cellular phone.  Dials.

                               MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.)
                     You have reached the voice-mail
                     of AMD Investments.  And, yes,
                     you are at the right place.

     Fucking great.

                               GIN (into phone, pissed)
                     I like men with a sense of humor.
                     This does not qualify.

     SNAPS the phone shut.  Checks the slip again.  Walks firmly across
     the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into...

     INT. KENDO SOUVENIRS - DAY

     The place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist
     crap imaginable.  The only paintings on display are renderings of
     big cats on black velvet.  She winds her way through, to a counter
     at the back.  One guy there...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I please speak with Mr. Okati.

                               OKATI
                     You doin' it.

     The best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the Hawaiian
     shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to
     be the guy who is selling you a Monet.  Even a minor one.

                               GIN
                     I think there's some mista...

                              OKATI
                     You from Mac?

     She stops.  Jesus.  The guy COUGHS horribly.

                               GIN
                     I'm from Mac.

                               OKATI
                     Lemme see card.

     She hesitates.

                               OKATI
                     Four million, six hundred
                     thirteen thousand, five hundred?

     Wow.  He slaps his hand on the table.  Lay it down, toots.

                               GIN
                     You first.

     He shrugs.  Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter...

     ...a brown paper-wrapped rectangle.  Not much larger than two feet
     square.  She can't even believe she's here, doing this.  Gestures
     to him.  Open it up!

     He obliges, COUGHING grossly all the while.  Unwrapped, the
     painting does look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it.

                               GIN
                     Now bring me the real one.

     He doesn't blink.

                               OKATI
                     This as real as it gets, lady.

     And from within her pocket.  The cellular RINGS.  She takes it
     out.  Puts it to her ear.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You got it?

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Is this an audition, a joke, or
                     a rip-off?  I'm staring at an
                     obvious forgery, here.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Turn it over.

     This gives her pause.  Then, cradling the phone against her
     shoulder, she does as she's told.  To see...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Is there an envelope?  Taped to
                     the back?  In a Ziploc bag?

     Sure is.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Uh-huh.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Detach the bag.  Read what's
                     in it.  Aloud.

     She does.  Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps...

                               GIN (reading into phone)
                     Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it
                     says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates,
                     statistics...specs on some kind of
                     machine, diag...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Papers back in the envelope,
                     envelope back in the Ziploc, very
                     quickly, without seeming to hurry...

     Her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told,
     cradling the phone with her shoulder.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Now take the debit card from your
                     purse, slipping the Ziploc into the
                     purse as you do it, shielding the move
                     from everyone in the room but Okati.

     And she does.  More deftly than we could ever have imagined.  Like
     a pro.

                               MAC (O.S., quietly)
                     Give him the card.

     A beat.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Mac, the painting's a forg...

                               MAC (O.S., even quieter)
                     This is a test.  Of whether you'll
                     still be alive four minutes from
                     now.  Do you hear me?

     Her face freezes.  In a pleasant smile.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Yes, Mac, I do.

                               MAC (0.5.)
                     Now.  Hand him the card, and tell
                     him in Japanese to pretend he is
                     checking it by phone.  Tell him to
                     take awhile, as if he's on hold.

     She turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati.  Hands him the card...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Mac says, pretend you're checking
                     this by phone, and take your ti...

                               OKATI (subtitled Japanese)
                     ...like I'm on hold, sure.

     And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some
     schmuck in baggy pants.  He takes the card, stares at it comically,
     picks up the phone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     While he's checking, look around
                     the room casually, as if searching
                     for the cheesy handbags...

     She begins to.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     All the while laughing, as if you
                     are chatting with someone you
                     actually like.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     I'm not that good.

     But she is.  And she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy
     handbags.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     As you're looking around, do you
                     notice any m...

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Three guys, two together, one
                     alone.  Cheap suits, not looking
                     at me in a cop-casual way.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Call out cheerily to Okati, in
                     English, 'Where's the toilet?'

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Can I say, 'little girl's room'?

     A beat.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Wing it.

                               GIN (calls out, cheerily)
                     WHERE'S THE CRAPPER?

     Okati, absorbed by his make-believe phone call, points around the
     back.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Get going.  Now.

                               GIN (into phone, as she saunters)
                     Mac, the painting isn't...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You've got what we bought, are
                     you out of their sight?

     She turns the corner.  Filthy corridor.  Restrooms at opposite
     ends.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Run into the men's toilet.
                     I know you know how.

     A beat of uncertainty.  She looks both ways.

                               MAC (O.S., ominous)
                     Are you running?

     And she DOES.  SPRINTING down the garbage-strewn hallway, throws
     OPEN the men's room door, BURSTING IN on...

     ...a wispy OLD GUY taking a leak through a HOLE in the floor.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

     The panicked little man STARTLES.  Bolts OUT the door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Jump.

     Jump?  HEAR now, from the corridor, footfalls POUNDING.  She looks
     down through the piss hole.  The surf ROILS thirty feet below.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     It's too small.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     The window, twit!

     Oh.  She hops OVER the disgusting hole, boosts herself UP to the
     small window, footfalls racing CLOSER, HOISTS herself HALFWAY
     through, DROPPING the phone a scary 30 feet to the surf below, as
     behind her, the door...

     ...SLAMS OPEN and she FLIES OUT the window...

                               GIN
                     SHIIIIIIIIIIT...

     WITH her in SLO-MO, kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder
     bag, and she...

     HITS the ocean like a ton of bricks.  Disappears.  Comes up,
     sputtering in the swirling water, as from out of the shadows of
     the pilings...

     ...an engine ROARS to life, the BLUR of a custom JETSKI, Mac
     reaching to scoop the startled girl OUT of the water, and they...

     ...BLAST OFF, as bullets RAIN helplessly after them.  The AGENTS
     shouting into their cellulars, racing in frustration down the pier,
     which rapidly vanishes behind us, as...

     ...Gin hangs onto Mac for dear life.  This baby is REALLY hauling.
     He wears an orange waterproof slicker with matching trousers.
     Shouts back, against the noise...

                               MAC
                     ARE YOU PISSED OFF?

     She thinks.  Admits, shouting in his ear...

                               GIN
                     ACTUALLY.  IT'S INCREDIBLY COOL!

     He is heading into deep water, a major shipping channel, points to
     one side, and she sees...

     ...a huge HARBOR PATROL vessel FIRE UP in near distance.  The chase
     is ON.  They speed toward the WAKE of a luxury liner, and as she
     realizes...

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOO...

     They SLAM INTO the wake HEAD ON, and are AIRBORNE for an amazing
     distance, JOLTING back to the surface, RACING toward...

     ...two gigantic FREIGHTERS which approach each other from opposite
     directions.  The Harbor Patrol in hot pursuit, BLASTING its HORN...

                               GIN
                     WE'RE GONNA DIE, AREN'T WE?

                               MAC
                     JUST AS SOON AS I'M READY!

     As we near the outbound freighter, Mac CUTS his speed.  Now the
     Harbor Patrol is really gaining.

                               GIN
                     FASTER, NOT SLOWER, YOU TWIT!!

                               MAC
                     HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SPORTING
                     CHANCE...

     Cruising STRAIGHT TOWARD the part side of the outbound freighter,
     as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side...

                               MAC
                     ...SOMETHING WE SCOTS LEARNED
                     FROM THE BRITS!

     As the Harbor Patrol is nearly ON them, Mac VEERS suddenly AROUND
     the stern of the outbound freighter, the Harbor patrol WHEELING
     madly to pursue, only to find we are both CAREENING straight AT...

     ...the starboard side of the inbound freighter, Mac CUTS his wheel
     in an adroit nearly right-angle SWERVE, and hears the SCREAMS as
     the Harbor patrol...

     PLOWS INTO the freighter!  Wasting no time, he ACCELERATES into
     maximum BURN, STREAKING toward the immensely crowded harbor and its
     thousand vessels.  Gin can't help but look back at the impressive
     crash site, mouthing a silent WOW.

     Nearing the harbor, Mac CUTS speed completely, drifting between two
     huge ships and...

     ...vanishing from sight.

     EXT. SMALL CHANNEL - DAY

     The tiny Jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of
     all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all
     larger than we are.  Gin clings close to Mac, although it is no
     necessary.  More like romantic.  She is still flushed with
     the rush.

                               GIN
                     I guess you're gonna explain
                     all this, huh?

     But he says nothing.  Pulls out a water-tight duffle.  Hands it
     back to her, without looking.

                               MAC
                     Dry clothes, you'll need them.
                     In five minutes.

     She takes the bag, confused.

                               GIN
                     I'm supposed to change?  Here??

                               MAC
                     I won't look.  Gentleman's word
                     of hon...

                               GIN
                     There are a million sailors!

                               MAC
                     I've seen you naked.  Give the
                     boys a thrill.

     He means it.

                               MAC
                     You probably won't be dating
                     any of them, so what the hell.

     Gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft.  No
     one seems to be paying much attention.  What the hell.  She unzips
     the bag, pulling out...

                               GIN (astonished)
                     These...these are mine!

     He never looks around.

                               MAC
                     Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps
                     the thief wasn't your size.

     She stares at the back of his head.  wondering.  He is stripping
     off his slickers.  A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath.

                               MAC
                     We have a business appointment.
                     In four minutes.

     Okay.  She pulls her dress off OVER her head.

                               GIN
                     Business, huh?

     She ignores some nearby WHISTLES and SHOUTS.  Begins drying herself
     with a fluffy towel from the bag.

                               MAC (never turns)
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     Uh-oh.  Paydirt.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Am I gonna like th...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I'm a thief.

     She can scarcely believe he's admitting this.

                               MAC
                     And now that I've told you.
                     I'll have to kill you.

     He chuckles a Scottish chuckle.  Cold and warm, at once.

                               MAC
                     Or...

     She slips the dry dress OVER her head.

                               MAC
                     ...you can spend the most
                     interesting three weeks of
                     your life.  Training.

                               GIN
                     Training for wha...

                               MAC
                     ...followed by the most exciting
                     night of your life.  After which,
                     you can walk away with 20 million
                     untraceable dollars...

     She blinks.  He means this.

                               MAC
                     ...which will come in handy.
                     Things being what they are.

     He shrugs.

                               MAC
                     From now on.  You can valet park.

     She begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress.  We
     suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty.

                               GIN
                     And if I refuse?

                               MAC (very quietly)
                     Don't.  Please.

                               GIN
                     I mean, you won't really kill
                     me, I'm far too adorable.

     He looks around at her.  As if deciding on that.

                               MAC
                     Last night, at Fujitsu, I did
                     some business.  While you thought
                     I was in the toilet.

     Jesus.

                               GIN
                     What could you possibly steal
                     in 18 min...

                               MAC
                     Thirty-five super-microchips.
                     Each worth one million dollars.
                     And change.

     Staring dead at her eyes.

                               GIN
                     You hate round num...

                               MAC
                     I stole your suitcase when I
                     left you at the bar.  I have
                     since sent it on to the States,
                     with three chips, well hidden.

     Are you following?

                               MAC
                     Since you aren't there to claim
                     it, the bag will sit at Customs.
                     Safe.  Unless...

     No smile.  No smile at all.

                               MAC
                     They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip.

     Holy.  Fucking.  Christ.

                               GIN
                     That's entrapment.

                               MAC
                     No, entrapment is what cops do
                     to robbers.

     We can feel her heart pounding from here.

                               MAC
                     Blackmail.  Is what robbers
                     do to schmucks.

     And leans.  To kiss her mouth.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Even adorable ones.

     They have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic FREIGHTER.  It
     is at water level, the steps they use for their tender.  He points
     up to the name...

                               MAC
                     Pop quiz.

     SHIKOKU MARU.  She nods, slowly.  Pulls the Ziploc bag from her
     purse.  Hands it over.  He removes the sheets of paper.  Begins to
     peruse them...

                               MAC
                     Admit it's a rush.  The best day
                     of your heretofore drab life.

                               GIN
                     Fuck you.

     He glances up.

                               GIN
                     ...accompanied by related foreplay.

     And gives him the smile. What a gal.

     He offers his hand.  She rises, hops lightly to the steps of the
     gangway in her bare feet.  He pulls dry shoes from the duffle.  And
     as she slips them on...

     ...he FLIPS a switch, and the Jetski begins to FILL with water, Mac
     stepping to the gangway beside her.  They watch...

     ...the Jetski rapidly SINK out of sight.

     No evidence.  A thorough guy.

     INT. FREIGHTER HOLD - DAY

     Mac and Gin stand inside a gigantic CARGO BAY, watching massive
     CONTAINERS being loaded by crane from a dock, through the gaping
     HATCH.  The chamber is a vaulted cathedral of steel, painted
     hospital green, and Mac's eye moves over all of it, seeming to
     inspect every plate, every pan head rivet.

                               VOICE (O.S., British cheer)
                     Hullo, there!

     They turn to see a round little man with watering eyes and a very
     wide necktie, skipping-down the iron steps.  Bursting with a
     salesman's bonhomie, he extends a plump hand...

                               MAN
                     Nickerson Carlsby, Mr...
                     MacDuff, yes?

                               MAC
                     Banquo MacDuff.  This is my
                     associate-fiancee, Ms. Duncan.

     The little man pauses.  A tic in the well-oiled smile...

                               CARLSBY
                     That is...fiancee and assoc...

                               GIN (cheery herself)
                     I'm a hyphenate.

     Ah.  Like that makes complete sense.  Fingers the gardenia in his
     lapel...

                               CARLSBY
                     Well, it's a pleasure, in this
                     alien place, to do business with
                     a countryman.

                               MAC
                     I'm a Scot.  It's a different
                     country.  Culturally and historically.

     I see.

                               CARLSBY (looking around)
                     Well.  They've brought you to
                     quite the wrong place, I see.

                               MAC (looking around)
                     Thank God.

     ANGLE...Carlsby leads the way along a narrow catwalk, which ends at
     a steel door.  He presses his thumb to the I.D. panel, and speaks
     into the voice box...

                               CARLSBY (confidential code-voice)
                     In Penny Lane, the barber shaves
                     another customer...

     The door CLANGS open.  They go through it, as a gangway leads
     toward an open five-foot-thick VAULT DOOR, where two ARMED GUARDS
     rise from their seats.  Carlsby ignores them as if they were
     furniture.  THUMPS the door...

                               CARLSBY
                     Five feet thick with hidden rein-
                     forcements, no way to drill through!

                               GIN (authoritative)
                     Impressive.

                               CARLSBY
                     Only the tip of our security
                     iceberg.  See these two Brinks
                     locks...?

     They do.

                               CARLSBY
                     The Captain keeps one key.  The
                     other is continually forwarded:
                     to the Chief of Security at next
                     port.  There is no way to enter
                     during voyage.

                               GIN
                     I like this.

     Carisby glances to Mac.  He is stone.

                               CARLSBY
                     The best armed guard, rotated every
                     six hours.  A redundancy, of course,
                     but we would rather be safe three
                     times over than merely two.

                               GIN
                     Sound mathematics.

                               MAC (very quiet)
                     What if there's a fire?  In the
                     chamber.

     Ah.  Carlsby leads them through the open door, into...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  Primo.  The steel coated with sleek,
     matte, black all-grip paint.  Tubby points up...

                               CARLSBY
                     Sprinklers.  New design.  Incredible
                     power.  The entire chamber is water-
                     proof, fireproof, airtight.  If the
                     ship sinks, God forfend, your cargo
                     is secure for salvage.

     No reaction.  Mac does not look convinced.

                               CARLSBY
                     And your cargo is...?

                               MAC
                     Wine.

     Wine.

                               MAC
                     The bloody Japs bought up half
                     the premium clarets in the universe.
                     You may have heard.

     Actually.  He has.

                               MAC
                     I'm in charge of shipping some
                     14,000 bottles, most quite rare,
                     to a number of premium hotels in
                     Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore,
                     Phuket, and Penang.

     Carlsby gets the romance of it all.

                               MAC
                     All of which are destinations on
                     your October voyage.  Five months
                     from now.  However...

     And turns to the man.  With laser, disapproving eyes.

                               MAC
                     Wine.  Doesn't prefer.  To be
                     jostled.

     The man beams.  Gestures to a series of PLATFORMS, each SWAYING at
     different heights, in different directions.

                               CARLSBY
                     Our 'delicate treasure' platforms,
                     suspended on gimbals.  Your cargo
                     remains unruffled by roiling seas.
                     Then, on arrival, is plucked...

     Pointing once more...

                               CARLSBY
                     By that forklift, and gently
                     deposited on dock through the
                     cargo hatch...

     ...a huge circular hatch cut into the hull.  Mac's eyes stare
     blankly at it.  A long beat.  He pronounces it all...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

     And then turns once more.

                               MAC
                     Did we see...a bathing pool.
                     On deck?

                               CARLSBY
                     Oh, yes, sir.  The Shikoku Maru
                     carries sixteen luxury suite pas-
                     senger cabins.  The finest cuisine.
                     For valued clients who prefer to
                     cruise in privacy.

     Mac.  Thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     Mildly.  Interesting.

     INT. PASSENGER DECK - DAY

     Carlsby ushering the couple along a plushly-appointed hallway.  A
     secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter.
     He opens a burnished door, into...

     ...an elegant SUITE.  Cherrywood panels, spacious windows with
     views of the harbor.  The finest furnishings.  It is breathtaking.
     Even...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

                               GIN
                     But dearest, in five months,
                     we'll be in Cape Town.

     Mac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been
     taped to the back of Okati's Monet.  Peruses them casually.

                               MAC
                     Anything sooner?  That goes
                     perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka?
                     To Jakarta.

     And looks up.  To a man dumbstruck.  By coincidence.

                               CARLSBY
                     Why, yes.  In three weeks.

     INT. CESSNA - DAY

     Looking DOWN on California's San Joaquin Valley from 12,000 feet,
     as air RUSHES past our open door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You seem depressed.

     PULL BACK to see them both in jumping suits.  He's checking her
     gear.  She's eyeing the expansive grid of fields below.

                               GIN
                     At your insistence, I'm leaping
                     to my death, and I don't know why!

     He clips a tether from his harness to hers.

                               MAC
                     Because.  You're a greedy girl.

                               GIN
                     I'm not jumping until you talk
                     about this, it's been two days!

     She folds her arms across her chest.  Rebellious.  He smiles at her
     tenderly.  Nods, okay.

                               GIN
                     Why are we going in three weeks,
                     if the wine is on a different
                     route months lat...

                               MAC
                     There is no wine.  That just bought
                     us a look at their security.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     I knew that.

                               MAC
                     What we want is on the boat in
                     three weeks.  Now can we jump?

                               GIN
                     The machine in those diagrams.  on
                     the back of the painting.

     Maybe.  He's still smiling.

                               GIN
                     What does it do, make gold?

                               MAC
                     We're nearing the targ...

                               GIN
                     Why won't you trust me?

                               MAC
                     How do I know who you are, hmmn?

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     For all I know, your name isn't
                     Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're
                     a cop.

     She stares back.  Dead straight.

                               GIN
                     Why would a cop do all th...

                               MAC (softly)
                     Entrapment, remember? What cops
                     do to robbers.

                               GIN (just as softly)
                     Oh.  That.

     His smile is light, affectionate.  Gently, he backs her to the edge
     of the doorway...

                               MAC
                     One...two...

     She THROWS her arms around his neck.  Holds him close.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm afraid.

     Vulnerable and touchingly real.  His arms slide around her.

                               GIN
                     Of you.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Smart girl.

     And JUMPS, Gin SHRIEKING in his arms, as we...

     FOLLOW them, TUMBLING in FREE FALL, until he releases her, and bot
     EXTEND their arms and legs, as if flying, as if gliding face down,
     her shriek CONTINUING.  He floats at the end of their tether, a few
     feet above her.  And at last...

     ...her SCREAMING STOPS.  We see the pure adrenaline rush.  Shouts
     back...

                               GIN
                     NEXT TIME, I'M ON TOP!

     EXT. HILLTOP, MARIN COUNTY - DAY

     Woods, rolling hills, a dirt path.  Mac stands by a sign at a
     crossroads, names, arrows, STINSON BEACH, BOLINAS, MT. TAMALPAIS,
     MILL VALLEY.  There is a phone booth nearby.  He holds a stopwatch,
     looking down the path, as...

     ...Gin runs into view, steady stride, breathing hard, sheened with
     sweat.  Approaching him, she slows to a stop.  Hands on her knees,
     catching her wind. He CLICKS the watch.

                               MAC
                     Consistent.  And rather impressive.

     She sends a nasty smile, thanks a bunch.  But maybe she likes the
     compliment, after all.

     EXT. MAC'S CABIN, BOLINAS - NIGHT

     Rustic cabin in moonlight.  Ringed by woods.  Middle of nowhere,
     which is where Mac likes it.  As we approach the lit window, we
     hear two oddly-matched sounds.  splashing water.  And the HISS of a
     violent POWER TOOL.  We MOVE THROUGH the window, into...

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Two figures stand in the shower, spray SOAKING their shorts and
     tank tops.  Gin is operating a sleek WELDER, trying to perform
     micro-surgery on a DARTBOARD which Mac waves in all directions at
     the end of a short pole.

                               MAC
                     All right, six and seven...

     She blinks the spray from her eyes, and deftly SEARS the wire
     dividing those two numbers on the board.  As Mac keeps waving it,
     she goes off line.  Concentrates.  Gets it right.  The wire PEELS
     away...

                               MAC
                     Three and four...

     EXT. CABIN - DAY

     CLOSE on Gin operating a small steamshovel with a loading
     attachment on the front.  It is mounted with two 2 x 4's, set
     close together, protruding from the loader.  She maneuvers the
     wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks.  But as she positions
     to scoop one up, her vehicle SWAYS WILDLY, and we PULL BACK to
     see it is...

     ...dangling from a CRANE, operated by Mac.  Gin stays with it,
     concentrates, and on the next pass she glides her boards UNDER a
     huge rock, LIFTING it awkwardly.  Ignoring the bumpy ride, she
     pivots, and deposits her prize in place atop what has become...

     ...a WALL of stones.

                               GIN
                     What the hell are we building?

     He gives this some reflection.

                               MAC
                     A chalet, I think.  Or an outhouse.

     EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

     Mac and Gin paddle KAYAKS, side by side.  A full moon slams off
     the rolling surface of the sea.  Light chop, enough to bob pretty
     strong once they stop paddling.  His stopwatch GLOWS.  He says
     only...

                               MAC
                     Forty seconds.

     And she FLIPS OVER, submerging her head and torso, and we go...
     ...WITH her underwater, upside-down in the kayak, she STRUGGLES to
     FREE a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit.  Fumbling
     to BREAK the seal on a slender TUBE, which BURSTS, sending a GLOW
     of yellow-green LIGHT in all directions.  She fits the flexible
     tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out...

     ...a small ELECTRIC FAN with side HANDGRIPS of black metal.
     Buffeted by the current, Gin manages to flip a small switch on the
     housing of the fan, and...

     ...nothing happens.  Again.  Nothing.  And again.  SHIT!  With a
     supreme effort, she tries to ROLL herself upright, but...

     ...can't quite make it.  Blind PANIC now, blowing bubbles, FLAILING
     at the kayak, which suddenly...

     ROLLS upright, manipulated by Mac.  She sputters and tries to
     THROW the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and SLAMS her
     across the shoulder.  She is furious.

                               GIN
                     Get your fucking equipment
                     together, man, this is a
                     professional operation!!

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Gin in a clearing, arms at her sides, a determined look.  Mac is
     somewhere just behind us.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     This time, when you raise your
                     arm.  Don't breathe.

     She nods, got it.  Focused.  suddenly, in the clearing before her,
     a HOSTAGE SILHOUETTE TARGET pops up, the outline of a terrorist
     shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a BLUR
     and...

     ...BLAMM, BLAMM, BLAMM!!!  The paper terrorist is NAILED in the
     head.  Two out of three.  She lets out a thin stream of air.  Proud
     of herself, but too cool to gloat.

                               MAC
                     Very, very nice.  Had a tour
                     with the Mosad, did you?

     She turns slowly.

                               GIN
                     Where does this fit in the
                     game plan?

     His enigmatic, yet fond, smile.

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  But one
                     never knows...

     A quiet wink.

                               MAC
                     You might need it with me.

     INT. CABIN - NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin leaning back at a 45 degree angle.  She is sweating.
     This is hard.  HEAR a SLAM-THWOCK!  And ANOTHER.  PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     She is climbing UP the inside of the angled A-frame CEILING, using
     hand rods with powerful SUCTION cups, and similar suction devices
     on the balls of her feet.  A human spider, inching up the wall with
     everything she's got.  She SLAMS the next hand rod down, and it...

     ...slips.

                               GIN
                     Shit.

     ...as she TUMBLES eighteen feet to...

     DISAPPEAR in an ocean of STYROFOAM packing bubbles, which EXPLODE
     in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator.

     She has totally VANISHED.  Buried alive.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     DID I SAY SHIT?

     Mac is wading into the sea of plastic bits, DIGGING her body out
     with his bare hands.  Once more, she comes up sputtering.

                               GIN
                     This one, I will not get!

     He's holding her in his arms.  Leans close.

                               MAC
                     But you will, you'll get it all.
                     You are actually...

     He kisses her.

                               MAC
                     Quite remarkable.

     Something in the way he looks at her.  Her return gaze is naked.
     It looks like love.

                               MAC
                     Take the rest of the evening off.

     And kisses her again.  Her eyes close.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH - MORNING

     Mac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's.   A
     short-wave radio is playing BBC World Service.  Leaning against an
     open laptop, is...

     ...Mac's stopwatch.  He glances up at it.  What he sees makes him
     reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw...

     ...a rectangular gun-metal gray DEVICE.  Looks like a cross between
     a remote control clicker and a large cell phone.  Turns it ON.  The
     power display GLOWS green.

     EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING

     Gin running alone.  Up the dirt path we've seen before.  Ahead, the
     crossroads, the sign.  The lonely phone booth.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac tuning the device, which is an advance-design SCANNER.  We HEAR
     overlapping CONVERSATIONS through bursts of STATIC...

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin at the phone.  Inserts her credit card.  Catches her breath.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac HEARS a phone RINGING over the scanner.  Punches RECORD, PLUGS
     the scanner INTO his laptop.

                               VOICE (O.S.)

     So do Mac's eyes.  Click the scanner OFF.

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin in her throaty, playful voice...

                               GIN
                     ...no way I'm telling you shit.

                               GIN
                    If I tell you what this is, and
                    where this is, you'll send back-up,
                    and those morons will blow my cover,
                    and I'll be too dead to accept your
                    apology.

     A longer beat.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're fucking him, aren't you?

                               GIN
                     Right to the wall.

     Her eyes are stone cold.  We've never seen her like this.  She
     looks like Mac.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're over your head, Baker.

                               GIN
                     Only romantically.  I'll write to
                     him in prison.

     She's pulling out a different piece of plastic.  A drug store phone
     card.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     Okay, it's your funeral.  Next time
                     I see you, I owe you a spanking.

                               GIN
                     Ooooo.  Is that a promise?

     Her cold eyes through his chuckle.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     While you're on secure, do you want
                     a transfer?

                               GIN
                     Nope.  I'm headed back to the hot
                     tub.  I'll call again, if I'm in
                     the mood.

     And hangs up.  Collects her thoughts.  Inserts the phone card.
     Dials from memory.  Fifteen digits.  She must be calling Mars.
     At last...

     ...a man's VOICE.  In a strange sing-song language.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Is it over?

     SMASH CUT TO...

     EXT. TIENANMEN SQUARE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Late night, mostly youngsters strolling the unfathomable vastness
     of the square.  At what seems an immeasurable distance, the huge
     illuminated portrait of Mao zedong hangs from the Gate of Heavenly
     Peace.  The scale of this place is unique in all the world.  PAN to
     a nearby parked...

     ...Mercedes.  COL. QIU of the People's Liberation Army, lounges at
     the wheel in full uniform.  Talks into his cellular...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...it's not over yet, it hasn't
                     even begun.

     He listens, winces.  We can hear Gin's voice yelling at him in
     Mandarin, dishing out a major piece of her mind.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...after Midnight, when his meeting
                     ends.  In Zhongnanhai.

     He doesn't like her attitude.  And there's plenty of it.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     The mask will be ready...

     A phalanx of TROOPS march past.  The Colonel turns his face to
     shadow.  Drops his voice...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     You fucking bring the bones.

     EXT. ZHONGNANKAI, BEIJING - LATE NIGHT

     The walled compound where the Politburo's elite work and live.
     From an open gateway...

     ...the MINISTER OF FINANCE appears, flanked by bodyguards in the
     drab green of PRC police.  They step onto the street and turn into
     a narrow hutong.  Down the alleyway comes a young man walking his
     bicycle through shadow.  Nearing us, he raises his right hand,
     and...

     ...SHOOTS each bodyguard TWICE through the chest, DROPS the bike,
     LURCHES at the Minister with something cylindrical and gleaming,
     and...

     ...SPRAYS the cowering official's FACE with something that makes
     him SCREAM in pain, the assassin RUNNING down the hutong for his
     life, as a fallen guard...

     ...SHOOTS him in the back, and he goes SPRAWLING, SKIDDING, face
     down.  Lifeless.

     INT. OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Col. Qiu walks beside a jaunty ophthalmologist, DR. HONGWEI, who
     is turning ON lights in the darkened office as they go.  Behind
     them, two PLA SOLDIERS half-carry the agonized minister.  Into an
     examination room...

     ...the minister gently set into an examining chair.  The doctor
     tilts the face up, shines a light into the minister's eyes, which
     makes him GROAN.  Eye drops now, which make the man YELP in pain.
     HONGWEI now moves the RETINAL SCANNER into position, resting the
     minister's chin on the slot provided.  Turns it ON.  The machine's
     panel FLASHES numbers in red lights.  Hongwei looks into the box
     from the reverse angle, to view...

     ...a red LASER SCAN moving across the pupil vertically, then
     retracing its path horizontally, left to right, right to left,
     up and down, at speed.

     Hongwei moves to a computer monitor with a graphic rendering of
     the retina, clicks the keypad to section off a slice of the
     graphic, and ENLARGES the section 100 times.  Looks like pixels.

     Back to the scanner.  Touch a button, and...

     ...a COMPACT DISC pops out of the disc drive.  He places it in a
     box, telling the minister...

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     We send this to the lab for finer
                     analysis.  One piece of advice,
                     huh...?

     The minister squints up, painfully.

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     No more red pepper in your eye.
                     Not for awhile.

     The doctor LAUGHS.  The minister seethes.  But Colonel Qiu...

     Has his mind.  On business.

     EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATE NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin's gloved hand, holding something we can scarcely see,
     as MIST floats up between us.  It is a carabiner with a nylon rope
     attached, and she CLIPS it to a thick wire.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     I'm freezing my tender parts.

     PULL BACK to see her in climbing harness, scaling a nearly-vertical
     CABLE, three feet in diameter.  Enveloped in fog which reveals,
     then conceals.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I'm relieved to hear you have some.

     PULL WAY BACK to see him below her.  The two of them climbing
     the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.  They are near the top, more than 700
     feet above the silvery black BAY.  A precarious, dizzying sight.

                               MAC
                     What's amazing, is that only eleven
                     workers died during construction of
                     this thing...

                               GIN (grim)
                     ...thanks for sharing...

                               MAC
                     Of course, the others were saved by
                     a safety net.

     Gin keeps her focus on the small railed PLATFORM just above her.  A
     gutsy gal.

                               MAC (loving it)
                     Now, as for the suicides, they
                     always jump facing the city.  Avoids
                     that tall fence about 50 stories down,
                     see it, there?

     She's at the platform.

                               GIN
                     I never liked you.

     Unclips one last time.  This won't be easy.  Throws her rope
     OVER the railing, and to her surprise, Mac braces himself with
     his legs...

     ...lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily
     to the platform.  Grateful, she hates to confess it.

                               GIN
                     One act of fucking human kindness...

                               MAC
                     Call it a lapse.

     And he swings lightly up beside her.  The fog has rolled past.
     There are several million stars.  Transcendent beauty.  She slows
     her breath...

                               GIN
                     And how does this fit into
                     the game pl...

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  We came for
                     the view.

     And from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal.
     Flutes, wrapped in velvet.  He POPS the cork in one motion, and it
     SAILS to its watery doom.  She can't help but watch.

     One more motion to pour both glasses.  Hands one to her.  Toasts...

                               MAC
                     To Ginger Baker.

     He clicks her glass.  She stares straight in his eye.  Shows no
     surprise, no fear...

                               GIN
                     I'm partial to drummers.  If they
                     played with Clapton and Winwood.

     And takes a sip.  Cool as a goose.  Licks her lips.

                               GIN
                     The prescription bottle.  When you
                     stole my suitcase.

     But he's not drinking.  Only staring.  The wind has picked up.

                               GIN
                     Armand Baker was my husband, May 13
                     to October 27, 1982, he played alto
                     sax, I was 17 years old.

     She takes another sip.  Good wine.

                               GIN
                     He named me Ginger.  He likes
                     drummers, too.

                               MAC
                     And you get sentimental for him.
                     Every time you order drugs.

                               GIN
                     I have I.D. in that name.  I use
                     it for various things I don't want
                     traced.  When credit unions turn
                     their computers my way.

                               MAC
                     I could listen to you lie all night.

     She toasts him.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Same here, fella.

     Slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she
     flinches.  Her eyes do flicker.  And follow.  He withdraws not a
     pistol, but a handful of...

                               MAC
                     Do you like diamonds?

     Nine DIAMONDS, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes
     from bugging.  Wow.

                               MAC
                     You asked.  Does the machine.
                     Make gold.

     Holy.  Christ.

                               MAC
                     Gold is shit.  It's six thousand
                     dollars a pound.  Worth your weight
                     in gold...?

     His eyes travel her body...

                               MAC
                     That would put you at seven
                     hundred thousand.

                               GIN
                     Would you pay it?

     And he leans.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     When the light hits you just
                     right.  I'd pay more.

     She liked that.  Maybe a lot.

                               GIN
                     The machine.  That we are stealing.
                     Makes diamonds?

     No answer.

                               GIN
                     Real ones?

                               MAC
                     Gem quality.  First ever.  God
                     save Japan.

     He toasts Blessed Japan to the East.  Takes a hit.

                               MAC
                     A diamond reactor takes graphite,
                     runs it through a combination of
                     lasers, electron beams, and scanning-
                     tunnel mg microscopes.

     He means this.  She is transfixed.

                               MAC
                     This one uses krypton-fluorine laser,
                     with a new isotope of krypton.

     She looks down at the diamonds in his palm.  His fist CLOSES.

                               MAC
                     The atoms are rearranged.  And
                     the molecule of graphite becoznes
                     a molecule of...

     He turns his fist UPSIDE-DOWN.  And LETS GO!  She GASPS as the
     brilliant stones FALL toward the sea.  Watching, watching, long
     after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated.  A hush.

                               GIN
                     I hate it.  When you make
                     a point.

     INT. SHIKOKU MARU - DAY

     CLOSE on two open PASSPORTS.  The names say BANQUO MACDUFF and
     ISADORA DUNCAN.  The faces are Mac and Gin.

                               STEWARD (O.S.)
                     All right, then.  All set.

     PULL BACK to see Mac and Gin dressed as tropical tourists.  She
     hangs on his arm.

                               STEWARD
                     We will keep your passports in
                     our safe until Jakarta.

                               MAC
                     Of course.

                               STEWARD
                     You are Suite 16...

                               GIN
                     ...and never been kissed.

     The steward doesn't get it.  Gin shrugs, sorry.

                               MAC
                     We had booked Suite 9.

                               STEWARD
                     16 is our Tokugawa Suite, far
                     superior, trust me.

     Mac consents.  A little wary.

                               STEWARD
                     You luggage is in the room, these
                     are your keys, the housekeeper
                     will show you t...

                               GIN (pouting)
                     Oh.  Can't we stroll around the
                     port?  Just a little?

     The steward checks his watch.

                               STEWARD
                     I'd be on board in forty minutes.
                     Just to be safe.

                               GIN (sweet smile)
                     Better safe.  Than sorry.

     EXT. DOCK, COLOMBO, SRI LANKA - DAY

     Mac and Gin stroll down the gangway, to the seedy, dangerous-
     looking wharf.  At the bottom of the gangway...

     ...a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests.  Each
     stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to ABOARD or ASHORE.  Mac
     moves the peg for 16...

     ...to the ABOARD position.

     And off they go.

     INT. SMALL PLANE - NIGHT

     Mac in his jump suit piloting the Dehaviland DHC-53 across the
     endless black of the Indian Ocean.  For the moment, he seems alone.
     Then...

                               MAC
                     Down there.  Ten o'clock.

     He means a tiny grouping of LIGHTS.  Way down there, against the
     darkness.  He switches on the AUTOPILOT.  Goes back to...

     ...Gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear
     just beside the window of the jump door.  Next to her, a pack that
     is even larger.  No fear in her eyes tonight.  Pure adrenaline.

                               GIN
                     Are you dumping fuel?

                               MAC
                     Changed my mind.  There's nothing
                     on the instruments downrange.  The
                     longer she flies before she ditches,
                     the less chance they notice on the
                     Bridge.

     As she stands, he begins to strap the huge pack ONTO her body.
     Jesus.  With her chute, and the other gear attached, the load makes
     us uneasy.  Not her.

                               MAC
                     You should lose the oxygen tank
                     at 8000 feet.

                               GIN
                     And how do I judge that?  Babe's
                     intuition?

     He points to an altimeter device on his wrist.  It says 12,000
     feet.  She cuts him a look.

                               GIN
                     So I just ask you on the way down?
                     Or were you planning to e-mail me.

     He pulls out an identical device.  Strapping it to her wrist...

                               MAC
                     I hate a crybaby.

     He straps the even-larger gear pack to himself.  Checks the path of
     the tiny lights far below.  Then, looks in her eyes...

                               MAC (simply)
                     You can do this.

     Not merely reassurance.  Affection.  Something connective between
     them.  You are my partner.  Her eyes send back that personal bond,
     and she nods.  I can do this.  Good girl.

     He pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles.  She does the same.  He OPENS
     the door, air BLASTING in.  One more look down below, and he holds
     up ten fingers.  Counts them down, nine...eight...

     She moves to the edge.  Watching him.  And on zero, she...
     ARCHES out INTO the starry VOID, and we go...

     WITH HER, the incomparable RUSH of freefall, straining to see him
     FOLLOW, skillfully altering his position to gain on her, coming
     close.  She is looking between him and her altimeter, as...

     ...his oxygen tank FALLS AWAY, and she CUTS hers loose, the air
     RUSHING past her, she looks DOWN...

     ...the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the
     freighter.  Back up to Mac, as he...

     PULLS his CHUTE, it is black and square, and JOLTS him to what
     seems like a full STOP far above her, and she YANKS her cord,
     but...

     ...nothing.  It doesn't open.  She is ROCKETING down, looking back
     up to see Mac make an exaggerated CUTTING sign across his body, and
     she closes her eyes, PULLS her secondary chute, which...

     POPS open, JARRING her violently, and she GASPS with the shock.  He
     is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to
     manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the
     freighter LOOMS in distance, she looks down and suddenly...

     ...the sea is RUSHING at her, she FIGHTS her braking mechanism,
     SHOUTING at herself...

                               GIN
                     FLARE, FLARE...

     ...and SLAMS INTO the water, PLUNGING down, twisting, disoriented
     CUTTING her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic
     to BREAK her light tube, which...

     ...GLOWS yellow-green, illuminating the freezing depths, she FITS
     it around her head, fights now to pull out the small ELECTRIC FAN
     we've seen before, KICKING herself toward the surface, fighting
     against the weight of her gear pack, she...

     ...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a PROPELLER which ROCKETS
     her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries
     desperately to hang on with one hand, but it...

     ...PULLS FREE, goes SHOOTING off into the blackness without her,
     one instant of TERROR in her eyes, and...

     Mac is THERE, diving at her with his propeller, she GRASPS his legs
     in a death grip, and suddenly, they are...

     AT the surface, Gin GASPING for air, and he CUTS his propeller,
     CRADLES her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear...

                               MAC
                     It's over, it's over...

     Her eyes are wild.

                               MAC
                     Catch your breath, quickly.
                     Hang on for the wake.

     She sees the FREIGHTER now, a black mountain CUTTING the sea, a
     huge WAKE pluming from its bow.  She grabs his waist with all
     she's got.

                               GIN
                     DO IT! GO!

     And he KICKS the propeller to LIFE, they ZOOM off, straight AT the
     towering wake and burst THROUGH it, RACING to the freighter's
     looming hull, speeding alongside, Mac looking up to find...

     ...a series of metal RUNGS, which begin twelve feet above the water
     line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far
     above.  Mac has a Kevlar rope with a GRAPPLING HOOK, and as he
     reaches the rungs, he...

     ...THROWS it high, one of the pronged hooks CATCHING on a rung
     twenty feet above them...

                               MAC
                     HOLD TIGHT!

                               GIN
                     IF YOU FUCKING INSIST!

     And he LETS GO of the propeller, PULLING both of them, laden with
     gear, OUT of the water with sheer brute strength.  PLANTING his
     feet against the outward curve of the hull, he CLIMBS with all his
     strength, hand over hand, until he finally...

     ...GRASPS the bottom rung.  He PULLS them up, until she can GRAB
     ON.  They hold tight to their rung for a beat.  He attaches them
     both with metal carabiner clips.

                               MAC
                     If I were you, I'd watch
                     the desserts.

                               GIN
                     Boy, I'll bet you were in
                     shape before you got old.

                               MAC
                     Too long ago to remember.

     And pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an
     the first.  Offers her his hand...

                               GIN
                     I can take it from here, thanks.

     Suit yourself.  They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted
     backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go.

                               GIN
                     If you'd packed my primary chute
                     right, I wouldn't ha...

                               MAC
                     Yes, you would.  You're a girl.

     Up, up.  And stop.  They are nearly halfway to the top.  Looking
     across the curved hull to...

     ...a large circular HATCH.  Thirty feet away.  The goal.  Mac
     pulls from his pack...

     ...their SUCTION CUP gear.  With practiced speed, they fasten cups
     to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups
     attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to...

     ...move LATERALLY across the hull's surface toward the hatch.  Mac
     is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like
     a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull.  Gin is deter-
     mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal
     solid one.  Dark water RACES by beneath her.,  By the time she looks
     up at the hatch...

     He is gone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Anytime you're ready.

     She looks UP sharply.  He is ABOVE the hatch, attached to the hull
     by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat.  Noting her
     astonishment...

                               MAC
                     Better angle.

     That it is.  He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack.  It's a
     battery-operated AIR WRENCH, and with a menacing WHIRR, only
     partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly POP all
     the rivets around the hatch.

     Gin has pulled out the slender WELDING TOOL we saw in the shower,
     and begins CUTTING through the metal seals around the hatch's rim.

     At thecrucial moment...

                               MAC
                     You might want to move aside...

     Which she BARELY does, as the hatch door PLUMMETS past her to the
     sea.  BIG splash.  Gone.  When she turns back, Mac is already
     THROUGH the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps
     partially revealing...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  We've seen this with Carlsby.  The
     fork lift.  The shadowy multitude of PLATFORMS on their gimbals,
     all SWAYING, in different directions with the plunging of the ship.
     Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort
     Knox.  The ROAR of the engines is louder here, and he moves close
     to her to speak beneath it...

                               MAC
                     May I trouble you for the torch?
                     Or would you rather just dance.

     Oh.  Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency,
     she tries to find the thing in her gear.  After watching her fumble
     for a bit...

                               GIN
                     I know I packed it.

     ...he just reaches in and pulls it out.  A small LANTERN which he
     FLICKS on, brilliantly ILLUMINATING the entire hold.  Scans the
     platforms...polnts to a CRATE wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic
     membrane.

                               MAC
                     Coal into diamonds.  A wealth
                     machine.

                               GIN
                     How do you know that's it?

                               MAC (as if stating the obvious)
                     It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's
                     the only thing worth waterproofing,
                     in case the ship sinks.

                               GIN (softly)
                     ...you twit.

                               MAC
                     Hmmn?

                               GIN
                     I'm just finishing your sentence.
                     Can't you answer a question with-
                     out making me feel stupid?

     He's heading toward the swaying platforms...

                               MAC
                     Why would I bother?

     He is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the
     magic crate.  She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it
     look.  She has to scramble, almost falling.  He's already pulled
     from his gear...

     ...six rubber POUCHES.  She hands him her welding tool, and he
     begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate.

     The plunging ship has the platform really rocking.

                               GIN (concerned)
                     They don't look like flotation
                     bags...

                               MAC (working fast)
                     Shit.  Well then, let's forget
                     the whole thing.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     Okay, it was a dumb ques...

     His eyes come UP.  So fast that her breath stops.  He looks plenty
     angry.

                               MAC
                     Let's get one thing straight.  I
                     don't work with partners much,
                     because basically, I find most
                     people to be idiots.

     She swallows.  Hard.

                               MAC
                     You, in contrast, are first-rate.

     He watches the effect of that play across her eyes.

                               MAC
                     And if I think so.  Maybe you
                     should start thinking the same.
                     Now move your ass.

     And goes back to work.  She pauses a beat.  Then pulls out two
     lengths of Kevlar rope.  Begins securing their platform to the one
     above, to minimize the amount of sway.  As she struggles with this,
     she sees him finish by welding a very small gray BOX to the top of
     the crate.

     When he glances up, he sees her staring at the box.

                               MAC
                     GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled
                     signal by satellite...

     He touches the device.  It BEEPS.  A light glows RED.

                               MAC
                     Precise coordinates.  You could
                     find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert.

     He rises.  JUMPS down to the floor.

                               GIN
                     Where you g...

                               MAC (walking away)
                     Fork lift.

                               GIN
                     That's my assignm...

                               MAC (turning back)
                     Unless you've got the keys,
                     someone has to hot wire it.

     Oh.

                               MAC
                     Finish up on the floaters.

     And heads off toward the fork lift.  Finish up?  She looks at
     the rubber pouches.  They seem finished to her.  Tugs at a couple.
     On pretty firmly.  Across the way, we HEAR the fork lift turn its
     engine OVER.

                               GIN
                     Won't they hear it?

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Over these engines?  Through five
                     feet of steel?

     She hurriedly secures the last of her Kevlar lines.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Hell, if they do, they don't have
                     the second key to get in.

     He is driving up in the rickety fork lift.  Weaving around crates
     and equipment.

                               MAC
                     Thank God for redundant security.

     He hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down
     INTO his arms.  Quickly, the switch places, Gin climbing into the
     idling fork lift, as Mac clambers up to UNBOLT the crate's pallet
     with his air wrench...

     Gin moves the fork lift into position.  Mac bracing his legs
     against neighboring cargo, using all his strength to hold our
     crate steady.  He is really straining.

                               GIN
                     How many tries do I get?

                               MAC (with effort)
                     One, before I beat you senseless,
                     dump you over the side, and donate
                     your share to charity.

     She brings the fork UP.  The crate sways slightly.  She lines up
     her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes...

                               GIN
                     You gotta work on that impatient
                     streak.

     ...and slips them straight IN.  First try.

                               GIN (amazed)
                     How professional.

     She LIFTS the crate, but the boat LURCHES, and she nearly LOSES it
     off the fork.

     But she doesn't.  SWINGS her load around now.  Heading for the open
     hatchway, the roiling sea racing by.  Picking up SPEED, slightly...

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Thing on the left is
                     the brakes?

                               MAC (laconic)
                     Or the thing on the right.

     By now she is really ROLLING toward the wide open spaces...

                               GIN
                     MAC, IT'S JAMMED!

     He POUNCES off the platform, FLYING after the lift as it
     ACCELERATES THROUGH the opening...

                               MAC
                     JUMP, for God's sa...

     ...TIPPING at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding OFF the prongs,
     our forklift TUMBLING OUT the hatch to the sea, just as Mac...

     ...SNATCHES Gin by her HAIR, pulling her FREE of the falling
     forklift, CATCHING the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, Gin
     SCREAMING in fright and pain, BLINDLY grabbing his arm to be...

     ...jerked BACK to safety.

     Clutching Mac, she watches the sea behind them.  Where the crate
     and the forklift disappeared.

                               MAC
                     You did activate the floaters.

     Her head WHIPS around.  Aghast.

                               GIN
                     Activa...

                               MAC
                     I did say, 'Finish up on the
                     floaters'.  Surely, you heard me.

     Her life.  Flashes before her eyes.  As behind the ship...

     ...the crate BOBS to the surface.  We can see the tiny red light on
     the transponder from here.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Oh.  Guess I did it m'self.

     She WHIPS back, and starts POUNDING at him with her fists.  He is
     laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can GRASP her
     wrists.  She SPITS in his face.  He strikes back by...

     ...kissing her hard.  She struggles for a beat.

     And then she lets him.

     When they finish, he reaches to UNZIP her jumping suit.  All the
     way.  Pulls it down gently, revealing...

     ...her evening gown.  A wrinkle-free material which slips down
     across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips.
     He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his
     own.  He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only...

     ...her evening bag and shoes.  Then lifting both packs, he...

                               GIN
                     Um...

     ...FLINGS them into the black ocean.  Gone.

                               GIN
                     ...I wouldn't do that.

     So he turns.  She looks really stunned.  And scared.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me?

                               GIN
                     Well...I saw our suction things.
                     Lying...over...there?

     She points.  To where no suction things are lying.

                               GIN (a mouse)
                     ...so I put 'em in my pack?

     His eyes WIDEN.

                               GIN
                     Or maybe.  I put 'em there.

     And points.  To where they are.

     She tilts her head.  Gives him a great smile.  Is he enraged?  His
     dry grin says, not hardly.

                               MAC
                     I like a quick study.

     Then again.  You can never tell.

     EXT. FREIGHTER DECK - NIGHT

     Expansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.  A silver-haired
     couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to
     barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.  She clings to
     his arm, it is romantic.  Until they reach the railing where he
     turns, and says something quietly in German...

     She stiffens.  Pulls her arm away from his.  She sneers coldly,
     calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of
     German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.  She absorbs the
     abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and...

     ...SPITS over the side.  Strides away from him.  He watches her go.
     Then...

     ...SPITS over the side himself.  And follows her.

     Half a beat.

     Mac's head APPEARS above the rail.  Just where they spit.  Not a
     mark on him.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Our old German couple are DANCING wonderfully in each other's arms
     Inspiring.  PAN a dozen really old couples dancing to the three-
     piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to...

     Gin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the
     surrounding geezers that they are very much in love.  We CLOSE to
     hear their sweet murmurings...

                               MAC
                     ...no matter how many stones we
                     make, the diamonds are just an
                     appetizer.

                               GIN (dreamily)
                     And the meal...?

                               MAC
                     My contract.  With DeBeers.

     She blinks.  Hit by a ton of bricks.

                               GIN
                     Oh my G...

                               MAC
                     Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world
                     monopoly in diamonds based on one
                     simple principle...something's only
                     priceless if it's scarce.

     He WHIRLS her in a tight spin.  The geriatic Germans can only watch
     and envy.

                               MAC
                     These guys dig up all the diamonds
                     on the planet, just to keep them out
                     of circulation.  Otherwise, you could
                     buy 'em at the Five and Dime...

                               GIN
                     Watch the old guy stuff, they don't
                     have dimestores anym...

                               MAC
                     Imagine the chaos we could cause.

     She is imagining.

                               GIN
                     You said 'contract'...

                               MAC
                     We're sort of bounty hunters.

     Gin likes the ring of that.  Green eyes dance with delight.

                               MAC
                     Our machine is worth far more
                     dead.  Than alive.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                     Glad to see you're both alive.

     They look over.  The officious STEWARD from this afternoon.  Now in
     black tie.

                               STEWARD
                     When you missed cocktails.  And
                     supper.  I thought of knocking
                     on your door...

     Mac turns Gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile...

                               GIN
                     Oh, I wish you had.  We love having
                     strangers join us!  Maybe later...?

     Mac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward
     across her bare shoulder...

                               MAC
                     Promise you an interesting time...

     Trademark smile.

                               MAC
                     Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff.

     You twit.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Our couple moving down the softly-lit hallway, past the burnished
     doors of luxury suites.  Her arms wrapped around one of his, their
     bodies close together.

                               MAC
                     ...well, I would ask what you're
                     doing with the rest of your life.
                     But that's your own bloody affair,
                     isn't it?

     She sighs.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  Anyway, before you get too
                     choked up on the farewell.  I feel
                     I owe you a confession.

     He glances down.  Really?  Really.

                               GIN
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     He thinks about this.  And then...

                               MAC
                     Not here.

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     Mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to...

     ...the BOWSPRIT, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail,
     it juts far out above a churning sea.  The whipping of the wind
     makes it seem all the more precarious.

                               MAC
                     It only looks dangerous...

     Holds out his hand.  She hesitates.

                               MAC
                     You couldn't fall off.  Unless
                     someone threw you over.

     Gives her the smile.  She puts her hand in his, and they hop
     UP to the platform.  Walk its length to the very end.  He turns
     now, leans casually against the fragile railing.  They are inches
     apart.

                               MAC
                     More intimate.  For a confession.

     Gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow.

                               MAC
                     What business.  You are actually.
                     In.

     She looks up.  To his eyes.  Into them.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  I'm not an art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  You're a cop.

     And tilts his head.  Just to one side.

                               MAC
                     An insurance investigator for
                     Webber Assurance, your boss is
                     an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've
                     been there four years and ten
                     months, you're quite the rising star.

                               GIN (evenly)
                     Nope.

     His head tilts.  Just a little farther.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     Nope?

                               GIN
                     I'm a thief, Mac.

     Holds the look.

                               GIN
                     For five years, I've used the
                     database of every client Webber
                     has to plan my jobs.  Museums,
                     banks, jewelers, rich people, I
                     have floor plans, alarm codes,
                     passwords, the works.

     His face absolutely neutral.  Unreadable.

                               GIN
                     I've made a fortune.  It's not
                     enough.

                               MAC
                     Why n...

                               GIN
                     Why wasn't it enough for you?

     He falls silent.

                               GIN
                     The Vermeer that was stolen from
                     Hancock Tower?  That was my job.
                     I scaled the building with
                     electromagnets, and parachuted
                     down an air vent...

     No smile at her lips.  Strictly business.

                               GIN
                     ...after mailing the painting.  To
                     where we're going next, actua...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     We.

     She looks him up and down.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, we.  You passed the audition.

     Now he smiles.  First time.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Imagine my relief.

                               GIN
                     I need a partner.  For the biggest,
                     smartest, job.  Ever.  The one you
                     retire off of, because nothing else
                     could ever compare with the rush.

                               MAC
                     Ever.  Is such a long time.

                               GIN
                     This is a job that can only be done
                     in one place, in one split-second
                     in human history.  If we miss that
                     instant.  We lose.

                               MAC
                     And it's worth...?

                               GIN
                     Eight billion dollars.  That's
                     eight thousand million.

                               MAC
                     How much in shillings?

                               GIN
                     You're not a real trusting guy.

                               MAC
                     And I tried so hard to hide that.

                               GIN
                     It's two jobs.  The first steals
                     something priceless from the National
                     Palace Museum in Taipei.  We don't
                     keep that.  We trade it in for our
                     ticket to the show.

                               MAC
                     One moment in time, you s...

                               GIN
                     Midnight, July 1, 1997.  Eight
                     days from now.  The moment that
                     Hong Kong is annexed by china.

     And now.  She has his interest.  She can see that.

                               GIN
                     80-20 split.

                               MAC
                     Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's
                     your plan, you should take at least
                     thirty perc...

                               GIN
                     My 80, your 20.  Asshole.

     He thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei.

     She is not impressed.  Or afraid.  He grins...

                               MAC
                     What are you gonna do with six
                     billion dollars that you can't do
                     with four?

                               GIN
                     Hold the record.  Alone.

     This.  He likes.  So much that he leans to kiss her, with
     surprising tenderness.

                               MAC
                     Your share is 50%.  And one dollar.

     Her hard stare.  And then, she smiles.  Just barely.  Still in his
     arms...

                               GIN
                     I like what you left.  In the hold.

                               MAC
                     You didn't even see wha...

                               GIN
                     A lump of coal.  A pair of pliers.
                     A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'.

     This is the most taken with her that he has ever looked.  She leans
     up and kisses him.  Whispers...

                               GIN
                     Squeeze hard.

     EXT. STREET, SHIHLIN DISTRICT, TAIPEI - LATE NIGHT

     Ugly section of an ugly town.  Unmarked warehouses, alleyways
     teeming with food stalls.  HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see...

     ...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.  Going real fast, maybe she's
     showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly
     WHEELS them into...

     ...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She climbs off, he doesn't.  As Gin
     goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner,
     mewing softly.

                               GIN
                     That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's
                     my bud.  An evil streak a mile wide.

     The elevator JOLTS to life.

                               MAC
                     No surprise.

     They CLANG upward.  Mac seems utterly relaxed.  Gin paces a little,
     hugging herself.  Her features tense.

                               MAC (gently)
                     Tired?

     She blinks up.  He is straddling the bike.  Smiling at her.

                               GIN
                     I have a lot on my mind.

     Ah.  Well...

                               MAC
                     You look beautiful doing it.

     He seems to mean that.  And it seems to melt her a little.  She
     sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as...

     ...they JOLT to a stop.  She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door
     SLIDES noisily open, to reveal...

     ...a gigantic LOFT.  She flicks on a dim light, but we see only
     part of the cavernous space.  She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting
     along behind.  Mac follows, looking around, then down to see...

     ...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.  The unopened MAILING TUBE we
     saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.  He crouches, lifts the tube in
     his hands...

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     You wanna buy a Vermeer?

                                    MAC
                     Rather steal it.

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     Been there, done that.

     He nods to himself.  Guess so.  He rises to see her framed against
     the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.  The twinkling
     island lies below.  But here, Gin stares down at...

     ...an elaborate architectural MODEL.  Fifteen feet across, it
     features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into
     the side of a model MOUNTAIN.  Formal gardens, fountains, tiny
     Kuomintang flags.  Stretching away from the building, a large
     portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed.
     As Mac joins her...

                               GIN
                     National Palace Museum, Taipei,
                     Taiwan.  Repository of four
                     thousand years of Chinese culture...

     He bends to lift UP the detachable roof.  All the rooms are
     detailed within, down to exhibit cases.

                               GIN
                     Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx,
                     pots and scrolls, paintings and
                     porcelains and lacquer work.  Every
                     treasure the Kuomintang could loot
                     before the Reds took over.
                               (beat)
                     Ever rob the place?

                               MAC
                     No.  If memory serves.

     She takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway,
     walking straight toward it...

                               GIN
                     You need to eat something, or
                     are you ready for sex?

     And just at the edge of it...

                               MAC (torn)
                     The options seem so limited.

     They jump THROUGH the opening.  And VANISH.

     Our ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a
     jewel against the hillside...

     ...the NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, looking exactly like the model.  The
     town spread out beyond.  Just as in the model.  And now we TILT
     sharply DOWN to see...

     ...a loading PLATFORM, suspended above the island, only a few feet
     below our opening.  Like a balcony without a railing.  Mac and Gin
     already sinking down onto a waiting futon.

     Looks like he's made his pick.  Among limited options.

     INT. LOFT - SUNRISE

     CLOSE on the MODEL MUSEUM in early light.  Propped against it, the
     unrolled Vermeer.  Pinned to the painting, a note we can't read.  In
     the B.G., HEAR what sounds like the rattling of a SUBWAY TRAIN,
     which runs a short distance and STOPS.  We TILT ANGLE now, to
     see...

     ...through the sunlit opening of the loading door.  Mac's head
     APPEARS, peeking up over the lip.

                               MAC
                     Ginny...?

     LOST in another brief subway rumble.  He lightly VAULTS up through
     the doorway.  Looks around, no Gin.  Goes to the model.  Lifts the
     note pinned to the Vermeer...

                               MAC (reads)
                     This lovely parting gift can be
                     yours.  If the price is right.

     Stumped.  Not in his cultural database.  He looks at the model, to
     see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been
     lifted away, revealing...

     ...an underground RAILWAY TUNNEL between the two.  Mac examines the
     tiny train, the tracks, the winding route.  From the side walls,
     well above the tracks, huge VENTILATION PIPES open onto the tunnel.
     Starting at the museum end, they are labeled VENT #1, and so on.
     There are five.  The last one shortly before...

     ...the mountain.  Where a cavernous opening is labeled BARRACKS.
     Tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot
     at the oncoming train.  And as Mac studies this curiously...

     ...the nearby SUBWAY RATTLES the walls once more.  Sounds like it's
     in the room, somehow.  Mac rises.  Saunters across the loft, and we
     see for the first time the enormity of this space.  Suddenly, the
     floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto...

     ...a spacious HANGAR, outfitted with 150 feet of RAILWAY TRACK, at
     the far end of which sits a full-sited TRAIN CAR, exactly like the
     one in the model.  And just below us...

     ...Gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen
     feet above the track.  She holds a remote control device, which she
     uses to REV the train's engine, far down the line.  She looks
     really tense.

                               MAC
                     Good morning.

     She startles slightly.  Shuts OFF the train's engine.  As she looks
     up to him now, the silence is noticeable.  He crouches down, only a
     foot or so above her...

                               MAC
                     Quite a parting gift.  I would
                     have settled for roses.

                               GIN
                     It's a joke.  You know, a joke?
                     People who have a sense of humor
                     make them?

     He's clueless.  But smiling.

                               GIN
                     You're rich, go buy an American,
                     have him fill you in on the culture.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  American culture.  Well,
                     that is a joke.

     He leans down.  Strokes her hair very gently.

                               MAC (murmurs)
                     Relax.  It's only eight billion
                     dollars.

     She looks up into his eyes.  But she can't smile.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of
                     Delft better than the larger one.
                     The sky is more emotionally rendered.

     Staring in his eyes.  And just as softly back...

                               GIN
                     Nice.  When a sky is that.

     He holds the look.  Very strong and very gentle...

                               MAC
                     Is it easier now? Not pretending.

     Is it?

                               MAC
                     Not pretending you're an innocent.
                     Not pretending you...like me.

     No answer.  Effortlessly, he hops down to join her.  Never losing
     eye contact.

                               MAC
                     Here's a tip from an old-timer.
                     Never forget who you are...

     Settles next to her.  Bodies touching.

                               MAC
                     It gives you someone to be.  When
                     you stop pretending.

     Okay?  She nods, slowly.  Her eyes moving over his face.  Maybe
     more feelings going through her than she can sort out.

                               MAC (still soft)
                     So.  Our train runs from the museum,
                     through an underground tunnel.  To
                     a mountain.

                               GIN
                     Because the museum displays 10,000
                     relics at any given moment.  But
                     there are 60 times that many, stored
                     in the mountain.

     This overwhelms.  Even Mac.

                               GIN
                     Which is why it's guarded.  By an
                     army.

     She is unfastening the small pack at her feet...

                               GIN
                     The train shuttles relics to and
                     from storage.  It looks exactly
                     like that.

     So Mac looks down the line.  At the train car.

                               GIN
                     I've been down the air ducts four
                     times.  The train always has two
                     armed guards.  Always travels between
                     32 and 36 miles per hour.  Relics
                     don't like to be jostled too much.

                               MAC (all business now)
                     Your model has five vents.

                               GIN
                     We go down the first.  Back up the
                     third, if you're lucky.  If not, we
                     have to get out by the fourth.

                               MAC (simply)
                     Then we will.

     She pulls from the pack four thick DISCS, each about eight inches
     in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop.  She
     starts to put two of them on...

                               GIN
                     Electromagnets, incredibly powerful.
                     This switch is on-off.

     He gestures at the train, the track, the hangar...

                               MAC
                     Seems like overkill.  For one
                     simple jump.

                               GIN
                     Well, it's an eight billion
                     dollar jump.  You miss the
                     train...you've missed the train.

     Flicks ON her remote.  Down the track the engine REVS.  Like crazy.

                               GIN
                     We've got five days to grab the
                     Bones, trade them for the Scan, and
                     pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong.
                     Once midnight passes on July 1st...

                               MAC
                     ...we've missed the train, yeh.
                     The Bones?  The Scan?

                               GIN
                     Oh.  Have I neglected to fill
                     in the details?

                               MAC
                     An oversight.

                               GIN
                     Which I learned from the master.
                     Hey.  Wish me luck...

     CLICKS the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36 MPH never seemed so
     fast!  She has a split-second to LEAP down, the train SAILS beneath
     her, Gin's feet GRAZE the back end of the platform at the rear of
     the car, she SWIPES DESPERATELY with the magnets, can't connect,
     and is THROWN into a ROLL along the side of the tracks.

     She's UP on her knees, watching the train SLAM into the massive
     blue PADS at the end of the track.  She is bruised, shaken, but
     most of all, really worried and really pissed.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Jump sooner.

     She pulls out the remote...

                               GIN
                     Be my fucking guest.

     The train ROCKETS backward, straight PAST where she kneels, to
     BRAKE at the start of the track once more.  She nods up to Mac,
     who is strapping on his magnets.  He crouches, nods, ready.  And
     the train...

     ...BLASTS toward him, he counts, JUMPS, and SLAMS ONTO the ROOF of
     the train, which PLOWS into the heavy padding, FLINGING him twenty
     feet like a rag doll to land in a HEAP.

     He lies still.  Then blinks, surprised he's alive.  HEARS a rich
     whiskey LAUGHTER down the track.

                               MAC
                     I'm too old for this shit!

     And as he pulls himself up.  She is staring at him, from her
     knees...

                               GIN
                     Know a dude named Wiley Coyote?

     ...with what can only be described as love.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Forget it.

     EXT. NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, TAIPEI - DAY

     AERIAL VIEW down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the MUSEUM,
     the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway.  CLOSE
     now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges...

     She is first.  Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing
     endless legs.  She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer
     who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making
     quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction.

     She takes his arm for support.  Murmurs in his ear...

                               GIN
                     Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending?

     Gives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders
     noticing.  Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering
     close...

                               GIN
                     Five years, you won't need
                     make-up.

     In answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract-
     ing attention all around.  His turn to whisper, as he massages
     her backside...

                               MAC
                     We agreed.  No underwear.

                               GIN
                     Overkill.  I can do it with legs.

     He stops.  Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over.

                               MAC
                     I'd lose the underwear.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Mac leaning on her arm, as they pass case after case.  Bronzes,
     jades, lacquer work.  Every object exquisite, priceless.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bones date back to the
                     Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago.
                     They are writings...carved into
                     ox bones, tortoise shells...

     She cuddles close to him.  They approach a tour group, the female
     guide speaking in four European languages.  Really loud.

                               GIN
                     The oldest Chinese writing any-
                     where, the first proof of Chinese
                     civilization.

                               MAC
                     What makes this one so valuable?

     He stops, drowned out by the tour guide, rhapsodizing over an urn.
     Butts into her rap...

                               MAC (subtitled Italian)
                     Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking
                     Sung Period.  The color is far too
                     delicate.

     The woman gets real insulted.  Apparently, he's right.

                               MAC (subtitled German)
                     It's all right, you have a nice
                     body.

     And walks on.  Confides to Gin...

                               MAC
                     When you're old, you can do
                     anything

     GRABS her bottom once more, altering her voice slightly on...

                               GIN
                     There we are.

     A separate display room.  A single steel pedestal.  Under the
     smart-glass security case, one single object.  It is a fragile,
     yellowed fragment of bone.  The shoulder blade of an ox.  Covered
     with tiny script.

                               GIN
                     Last year, ancient artifacts were
                     discovered in the Gulf of Mexico.
                     An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old.

     No tourists in the display room.  A velvet rope is up.  Three
     GUARDS mill at the entrance.  This exhibit is off-limits.

                               GIN
                     Amazingly, markings on these
                     Olmec figures were identified
                     as Shang Dynasty writing...

     A sign explains, SORROWFUL TO INFORM ORACAL BONE CLOSE FOR TRAVEL
     EXIBITION UNTIL IS NOVEMBER.

                               GIN
                     This particular Bone is price-
                     less, because it is the one that
                     establishes the link.  Proves that
                     American civilizations descend from
                     Chinese ancestors.

     She is pulling out her coin purse, as they stand by the rope.
     Unzipping it slowly...

                               GIN
                     Exactly the kind of propaganda
                     shit they eat up in Beijing.  The
                     mainland would pay anything to get
                     its paws on th...

     As her shaking 'elderly' companion SPASMS, knocking the purse OUT
     of her hand, it CLATTERS to the floor, sending a hundred coins
     ROLLING in all directions.  Some under the rope.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     SHIT!  BLOODY HELL!!!

     And collapses to the hardwood floor in search of the coins, HOWLING
     as he BANGS his knees.  Some bystanders hurry to help.  And one of
     the guards.  As Mac tries to crawl under the rope to pursue
     coins...

     ...the guard STOPS him with a firm hand, pointing at the pidgen-
     English sign.  Meanwhile, calmly, very slowly...

     ...Gin crouches down to retrieve coins, the short skirt riding
     recklessly high on her upper thighs.  The two remaining guards
     hurry to help her.  Mac's guard, bystanders, all transfixed by the
     marginal preservation of her modesty.  Noticing the eye-lines all
     around, she confides to the nearest guard...

                               GIN (in Mandarin, helpful)
                     Those are the coins.  These
                     are my legs.

     Unnoticed, Mac is BANGING his wristwatch, which seems to have
     broken.  CLOSE on him now, manipulating a glide point DEVICE on
     the side of the watch, and we RACK FOCUS to see...

     ...one coin.  Inside the rope.  Move.

     As Mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere, he guides the coin's
     slide slowly, inexorably, to...

     ...ATTACH itself magnetically.  To the steel pedestal.  Beneath the
     Bone's case.  As it does, Mac's watch BEEPS slightly, as we CLOSE
     on it to see...

     ...DATA flickering across its face.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     Amanda!  Time for my pills!

     INT. NOODLE SHOP, TAIPEI - DAY

     Gin and Mac at a long communal table, ignored, by Taiwanese couples,
     families, businessmen, chattering loudly all around them.  Gin
     looking down at her bowl, she's barely touched her meal...

                               GIN
                     ...no, I don't think that way.

     Glances up.  Mac is eating heartily, happily.

                               GIN
                     ...and I suppose you do?

                               MAC
                     Get lonely?  Sure, all the time.
                     It's healthy.

     Stuffs his mouth full.  Talking around it...

                               MAC
                     What's unhealthy.  Is denial.

     She's studying him as he eats.  Since he's not looking at her,
     Gin's eyes are thoughtful, appraising.

                               GIN
                     Be real.  you could never see
                     yourself...you know, quitting the
                     game.  Settling...down.

     And he looks up.  Direct to her eyes.  A dead straight, heart-
     stopping look.  Before the wonderful smile.

                               MAC
                     Why, Ginger.  This is so sudden.

     She cuts him a hard look.  Not funny.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Late afternoon, the place has closed.  Four armed GUARDS,
     accompanied by a museum OFFICIAL, push a large DOLLY across the
     hardwood floor, heels clicking, wheels rumbling softly, into...

     ...the room we've seen.  The dolly stops by the display case of the
     priceless oracle Bone.  The four guards position themselves around
     the triple-paned bulletproof case.  It will be a bitch to lift.

     The official has a key.  He inserts this into the lock of the
     titanium frame which holds the case to the steel pedestal.  And
     as it CLICKS, we...

     SMASH CUT TO...

     INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY

     Mac's arm rising with noodle-laden chopsticks, the wristwatch
     BEEPING softly.  He drops the chopsticks, rising in one fluid
     motion as Gin does the same, throwing some bills on the table,
     he leads her...

     ...OUT the door, INTO the street, step OFF the curb, turn, DROP
     flat on his back, SLIDE DOWN the gutter, Gin following a split-
     second behind...

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     A train car stands, pulled up to a loading dock.  Two SOLDIERS with
     assault rifles on the train's rear platform, waiting.  Along one
     side of the tracks, a gravel roadway.  An open air Jeep-type
     military vehicle stands empty.  One of our soldiers speaks into a
     walkie-talkie, watching a huge steel DOOR at the entrance to the
     loading dock, which...

     ...OPENS now.  Through it come the four armed museum guards,
     surrounding the dolly which carries the Bone's massive bulletproof
     display case.  The official is with them, and hands paperwork to
     one of the waiting soldiers, as the museum guards LIFT the case,
     and carry it onto the train.

     INT. TUNNEL SHAFT

     An empty stretch of dimly-lit track, somewhere down the line.
     Silent.  PAN up, way up, to...

     ...the shadows of a huge air vent.  Must be vent #1, because two
     FIGURES are crouched there, as close as lovers.  Even we can barely
     make them out, until we CLOSE to hear the hushed...

                               GIN (strapping on a backpack)
                     ...way we can use those in here.
                     I thought I was in charge of
                     this operat...

                               MAC
                     You're in charge of ego and worrying.
                     I'm in charge of keeping you alive.

     He is holding something dull gray and small.  It looks like a trun-
     cated nerf football with one end pointed and the other cut blunt.

                               MAC
                     These are plasma jet.  All the
                     force is directed forward, instead
                     of dissipating in a sphere like a
                     grenade.

     He has four of these.  Gives her three.

                               GIN
                     I don't need th...

                               MAC (whispers)
                     Shut up.

     He reaches out, gently...

                               MAC
                     You don't trust me, you won't get
                     through this.

     Touches her face.

                               MAC
                     Try to adjust to that for three
                     more days.  After July 1...

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     ...you'll never have to trust again.

     And smiles.  One more whisper...

                               MAC
                     Something.  To look forward to.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     The museum guards are back on the landing with the official.  Our
     two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train
     car, as...

     The train RUMBLES to life.  Ready to go.

     INT. MUSEUM

     Two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty
     pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case.  One tilts the top
     of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to
     lift the base, and...

     ...stops.  He sees the coin.  Oddly flat against the pedestal's
     shaft.  He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet HOLDS it
     fast.  He looks up to his companion.  Then...

     ...PEELS the coin free, the other guard reaches for it, the first
     guard YANKS it away, and it FLIES from his hand, INTO the wall, and
     drops.  As the guards go to look, the coin's back has come away.
     Revealing...

     ...electronics.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     An ALARM SHRIEKS at a deafening level.  Five museum GUARDS BURST
     through the doorway, LEAP from the landing, pile into the Jeep, and
     BLAST OFF down the gravel roadway after the departed train.

     INT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE

     A much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel, facing back
     the opposite way.  The ALARM SCREAMS here, too, and massive steel
     doors CLANG open, as 25 SOLDIERS with assault rifles SWARM out onto
     the landing, taking up sharpshooter positions, weapons pointing
     back up the track.

     INT. AIR VENT #1

     Mac and Gin crouched in the vent, high above the track, gas masks
     dangle around their necks, magnet paddles from their wrists,
     various objects from their belt loops.  The alarm ECHOES,
     absolutely EAR-SPLITTING.  She leans to shout in his ear...

                               GIN
                     WE HAVE TO ABORT!

     Above the siren, we can now hear the TRAIN coming...

                               MAC
                     HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER
                     OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
                     INCONVENIENCE?

     The train LOUDER, closer, the alarm BLARING...

                               GIN
                     THEY'VE GOT AN ARMY DOWN TH...

                               MAC
                     I can do this.

     Quietly.  Straight in her eyes.  The train ROARS into view, FLASHES
     beneath them, as he GRABS her wrist and...

     ...JUMPS, HURTLING DOWN, both STRIKING the empty rear platform,
     Gin slipping off, but he HOLDS her fast, SWIPING with his magnet
     which...

     ...CLANKS hard, LOCKS solid.  He PULLS her onto the platform,
     she looks dazed, clinging to him, he tugs her gas mask into place,
     slips on his own, and...

     ...FITS a magnetic DEVICE from his belt loop ONTO the door
     lock, SPINS a dial on the device, which POPS the lack OPEN,
     Mac BURSTING...

     ...THROUGH the door, lobbing a GAS GRENADE at the startled guards,
     who try to whirl and FIRE through the fog of red smoke, two wild
     SHOTS above the rolling Mac, and they are felled by the gas where
     they stand.  Gin races in, falling on her butt, as the car ROCKS
     along the track.  Points OUT the window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY
                     45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD!

     Scrambling to her feet, Mac wheeling toward the Bone.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TEST THE CASE!

     He THROWS a handful of coins at the glass case, and purple UV BEAMS
     ARC from the glass to FRY the coins in midair.  Mac pulls a dull
     rectangle the size of a cigar box from Gin's backpack, as we
     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep BLASTING after the train at crazy speed, the four non-
     drivers with weapons at the ready...

     INT. BARRACKS LANDING

     TROOPS FILL the platform, and have spilled onto the tracks, enough
     weapons to dust Butch and Sundance.

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized
     OSCILLOSCOPE, with countless KNOBS and a SCREEN which displays
     WAVE PATTERNS.  The machine is emitting SHRILL whistling TONES
     that cut through even the siren.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB!

     Mac SPINS the dials and two overhead light bulbs BLOW.  The glass
     case housing a fire ax SHATTERS.  The Bone's case is untouched.

     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     WITH the Jeep, BOMBING around a curve to SEE the train at last.  WE
     OPEN FIRE, accelerating after the train with everything we've got,
     gravel FLYING like shrapnel, and up ahead...

     ...the train's windows BLOW OUT, the tunnel SHOWERED with glass
     fragments.  SMASH CUT...

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac JUICING the box, the deafening TONE competing with the sirens,
     the gunshots, Gin SHRIEKING as she points through a blasted-out
     window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THIRD VENT GONE!

     And the Bone's case EXPLODES, Gin WHIRLING away to protect her
     face, as we SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep now ALONGSIDE the rear platform of the train.  The driver
     fighting to hold it steady, as...

     ...the guards begin to CLAMBER over the side, GRASPING for the
     platform's rails, one goes DOWN screaming onto the tracks, but two
     MAKE IT, then a third, they BURST...

     ...INTO the train to see...

     Nothing.  Two groggy, half-conscious soldiers.  Discarded gas
     masks, oscilloscope.  No Mac.  No Gin.  And inside the shattered
     case...

     A chicken bone.  The pack-rat strikes again.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Mac and Gin FLATTENED to the side of the train above the window
     line, held fast by their magnets.  We are on the opposite side from
     the gravel path, so the train screens us from the jeep.  SHOUTING
     above the din...

                               GIN
                     THERE'S THE FOURTH!

     Up ahead an AIR VENT looms, we are HURTLING toward it.  Mac and Gin
     each free one hand, reach into their backpacks for...

                               GIN
                     OUR LAST CHANCE, THE FIFTH IS
                     AT THE BARRACKS!

     ...twin GRAPNEL GUNS, which look like big 9mm pistols, but with a
     blunt, round end.  As we STREAK toward the VENT, Gin lifts her gun,
     SHOOTS at it, a cable-attached PROJECTILE EXPLODING toward the
     target, OPENING in mid-flight to a three-pronged HOOK, which...

     ...FALLS just SHORT, the hook tumbling to CLANG on the tracks, as
     Mac...

     ...FIRES his, the projectile EXPLODING, the hook OPENING and...

     ...BITES into the wall, only four feet from the vent, its cable
     stretching back to the gun in Mac's hand, we're almost there, and
     Mac slips the pistol...

     ...INTO Gin's free hand.

                               GIN
                     WHAT ABOUT YOU?

                               MAC
                     ALLOW US A MOMENT OF CHIVALRY.

     Their eyes meet.  He sees her hesitate to abandon him.

                               MAC
                     FIRST RULE.  SAVE NUMBER ONE.

     They FLASH PAST the vent, Mac RELEASES her magnet, Gin's freed hand
     GRASPING to join the other at the pistol, as she...

     ...ROCKETS up, CATAPULTED back toward the vent by the retractable
     cable, as a RIFLE APPEARS from a window beneath us, taking aim at
     Gin, and Mac...

     KICKS it off line, the shot BOOMING, the guard almost dropping
     the weapon, then SWINGING it back UP, slamming the muzzle directly
     INTO Mac's GROIN, as Mac...

     ...GRASPS the barrel, YANKING it up, SLIPS the shot SCREAMING past
     his head, PULLING the guard half out the window to KICK his face,
     sending him DOWN to the tracks, as we CAREEN around a curve, seeing
     in distance now...

     ...the END of the line, the massive BARRACKS LANDING, the phalanx
     of TROOPS, the fifth and final AIR VENT midway between us.  Mac's
     free hand pulls out...

     ...the lone PLASMA GRENADE he kept for himself, and as we CAREEN
     toward the troops, Mac HEAVES the grenade uptrack, and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, which RIPS UP the train
     tracks, COLLAPSING a section of tunnel wall ONTO the gravel path, a
     choking CLOUD of yellow SMOKE filling the tunnel, obscuring
     everything, our train ROCKETING...

     ...TOWARD the flames, nearly AT the metal SUPPORT BEAM which runs
     vertically up to the final air vent, and as the train FLASHES PAST
     it, Mac...

     LUNGES out, SLAMMING both magnets ONTO the support beam, the
     momentum FLATTENING his body fully horizontal like a flag on a
     pole, the train PLUNGING ON without him, as guards shoot blindly
     back from the windows, the jeep PLOWING full tilt INTO the rubble
     of tunnel wall, the train...

     ...DERAILING in a terrifying CRUSH of twisted metal, screams,
     shouts, the smoke and flame everywhere, and we SNAP TO...

     REVERSE ANGLE...the soldiers' POV from the landing, SCATTERING as
     the derailed train HURTLES AT them, INTO them, chaos, until at last
     they see...

     ...above the clearing smoke, near the tunnel ceiling...

     ...Mac CLIMBING deftly up the support beam, magnets CLANKING, hand
     over hand, nearly at the vent, and the shouting troops...

     ...OPEN FIRE, bullets CHEWING UP the tunnel wall, as we SMASH CUT
     TO...

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

     Silence.  Cluttered, dimly-lit storage room.  Boxes of SHOES reach
     to the ceiling, Gucci, Bruno Magli, the good stuff.  Footsteps
     precede...

     ...a young SALESMAN, tailored, attractive.  He goes right to the
     shelf he needs.  Opens a box.  Takes it and two others.  As his
     steps recede, we PAN UP to...

     ...the ceiling.  The mesh grating, which soundlessly...

     ...slides away.  Gin DROPS lightly, twelve feet to the floor.
     Filthy from her adventure, she quickly unzips her backpack to
     remove...

     ...a sleek Halliburton case.  Opens it.  The Oracle Bone undamaged
     in its cushioned setting.  Steps returning, she is...

     ...OUT of her jumpsuit in a heartbeat, revealing a costly slip of a
     dress, kicks the jump suit under the bottom shelf, as...

     ...the young salesman APPEARS to find her peeking into a shoe box.
     He is startled.  She scowls at him, rubbing the grime from her
     face...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     There you are!  Do you know how
                     filthy this place is?

     Shows her dirty fingers as proof.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Madam, no one is supp...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I'm looking for dress pumps, I'll
                     need eight pairs.

     Oh.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Unless you're too busy to help me.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well, no, I...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Come to think of it, I need some
                     dresses for evening...

     Lifts the Halliburton case, slings her pack over her shoulder,
     strides to the doorway.  See the crowded upscale boutique...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Are you coming?

     Out she goes.  And he follows.  Maybe he's on commission.

     INT. VENT - DAY

     Mac, very much alive, somewhat the worse for wear, crawling through
     a darkened pipe on his belly, toward...

     ...a grating.  Light filters through.  Reaching the screen, he
     squints through it.  Can't see shit.  Listens.  Nothing that rises
     above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct.  He grasps the wires,
     pushes, and...

     ...FALLS straight THROUGH, tumbling ten feet to CRASH LAND in a
     heap.  HEAR feminine SCREAMS before we look up to...

     ...three young WOMEN trying on lingerie, being attended by an older
     SALESWOMAN.  The girls are half-naked and as Mac rises, one THROWS
     a red lace TEDDY in his face.  He peels it off, and still holding
     the garment, calmly tells the saleswoman...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     It's all right, the security cameras
                     behind the mirrors are working again.

     At which the customers SHRIEK, cover themselves all the more, and
     begin screaming at the poor saleswoman.  During which...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well.  If everything is in order...

     All four women.  Look at him.

     EXT. LINGERIE SHOP, SHIN KONG MALL - SUNSET

     CLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes...

     ...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once
     again landing in pieces.  It's a long day.  As Mac clears his head,
     they stand at the doorway with folded arms.  Hoping he wants some
     more.

                               MAC
                     WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN
                     BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE
                     WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY!

     The bruisers look at each other.  No habla Espanol.

     EXT. KAOHSHING HARBOR, TAIWAN - DUSK

     A super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.  A woman
     paces the deck.  Every time we see her, she seems more tightly
     wrapped.  At last...

     ...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the
     gangway, pulling from inside his coat...

     ...the red lace teddy.  He drapes it over her face, and she pulls
     it away, steps into his arms...

     ...her kiss is urgent.  Real.  HOLD on the look in her eyes.  What
     is she thinking?

     He strokes her hair, gently.  Then, goes to look into the
     Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.  As he crouches.  As he
     looks at the Bone...

     She is watching him.  An intensity to her gaze.  More feeling than
     she is comfortable with, which...

     ...disappears completely, as he turns to her.  And when he mimes
     FLINGING the case into the sea...

     She laughs.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE, HONG KONG - DAY

     CLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK,
     counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12
     HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     PAN to an AERIAL VIEW of...

     Hong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder
     streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS...

     ...billboards everywhere.  Western businesses that announce WE'LL
     STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.  Others, primarily British, sending
     farewells, gratitude for past patronage.  China-sponsored
     depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE
     COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS.

     ...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs
     advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.  Traffic beyond
     gridlock.  The human ant colony.

     ...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American
     Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG
     KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING.

     ...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.  More
     orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say
     MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese
     soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers.

     CLOSE on the square now.  A couple at a sidewalk vendor.  Mac is
     purchasing a t-shirt.  Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips
     the garment over her head.  It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I
     GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.

     He regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if
     wearing a Givenchy original.  He approves, lifts the Halliburton
     case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac...

     ...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the
     impact.  The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the
     two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE
                     YOU'RE GOING, MAN!

     No one notices, no one cares.  Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get
     involved, dear.  Mac reluctantly steps back.  The soldier glares at
     him.  Then, bends and picks up...

     ...Mac's case.  A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier
     starts off.  Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed...

     ...PISTOL, ready for action.  But keeps watching, as within a few
     yards, the soldier...

     ...stops.  Opens the case.  Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there
     in the middle of the square.  Mac and Gin watching across the
     distance, with hair-trigger keenness.  At last the soldier CLOSES
     the case...

     ...walks back to us.

                               SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I believe I took your case.

     Handing it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented
     English...

                               SOLDIER
                     21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes.

     Picks up his own case.  And is gone.

     EXT. MANSION, VICTORIA PEAK - DAY

     A vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION.
     Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.  Gin is
     driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.  As
     they pull up the crushed rock driveway...

     ...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.  Climbing from
     the car, Mac has the Halliburton case.

                               BUTLER
                     Will you please come this way?

     And leads them around the side of the house.  They walk slowly, a
     distance behind the butler, taking everything in.

                               MAC
                     I like this.

     His voice is strong, calm.  No hint of a smile.

                               GIN
                     You like wha...

                               MAC
                     Not being told what the fuck
                     we're doing.

     She looks equally serious.  Just more tense.

                               GIN
                     You're on a 'need to know' basis.
                     You'll get each step in time to
                     execute, I thought you agreed to
                     those condit...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I like your not trusting me.
                     Because it frees me to do
                     the same.

     They come upon the spacious GROUNDS behind the mansion.  A
     breathtaking view down the slope of Victoria Peak to Hong Kong and
     the harbor.  Kowloon across the water.

                               GIN
                     I trust you.  I only need to...

                               MAC
                     ...remain in control.

     They pass a towering row of perfect ROSEBUSHES.  Mac SNAPS OFF a
     giant blossom.

                               MAC
                     Which is a sign of weakness.

     And hands it to her.  Their eyes meet.

                               MAC
                     I like that, too.

     At the edge of the garden, above the commanding view, a luncheon
     TABLE has been set.  Spread with delcacies.  Two SERVANTS attend,
     also British.

     Only the host is seated.  He does not rise.

                               GIN
                     Colonel

     Col. Qiu glances up from his meal.  Green PLA uniform, absurdly
     decorated, wraparound Gautier sunglasses.  We recognize him as the
     man who took Gin's call in his Mercedes in Tienanmen Square.  The
     man who accompanied the poor Minister of Finance to the ophthal-
     mologist.

                               QIU
                     You look lovely, Ginger.  Is
                     the rose for me?

                               GIN
                     Of course.

     And leans prettily.  To fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel.

                               GIN
                     Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Hearing his real name, Mac cuts her a look.

                               GIN
                     Real names here, darling.  The
                     Colonel and I have every incentive
                     to keep each other's secrets.

     And she sits.  Close to Qiu.  Mac looks around at the property,
     the view.

                               QIU
                     Like the place, Andy?

                               MAC
                     Please.  Mr. MacDougal will do.

     The Colonel smiles.  First time.  Like an alligator.  Mac notices
     that the tablecloth is actually...

     ...a Union Jack.  He fingers the flag.

                               QIU
                     This way.  Doesn't matter if we
                     spill.

                               MAC
                     My sentiments exactly.

     He sits.

                               QIU
                     This place was a gift.  From
                     its former owner.  A Brit whose
                     business will now happily continue
                     to function.  Perhaps...even expand.

                               MAC (spreading his napkin)
                     Planning to spend much time here?

                               QIU
                     Tho it has required many sacrifices.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel has divorced his
                     wife.  To facilitate the necessary
                     entertaining of Western women.

                               QIU
                     Tho some are more entertaining
                     than others.

     And runs the back of his knuckles up the length of Gin's bare arm.

                               MAC
                     Colonel.  You are touching the woman
                     I love...

     Which brings Qiu's eyes over.  Really?

                               MAC
                     From time to time.

     And pulls up the Halliburton case.  Handing it across the table.
     As Qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it...

                               QIU
                     You're a Scot.  Would you like
                     some 25-year-old Macallan?

                               MAC
                     Sure, I'll take a case.

     Qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the
     bar trolley.  As the drinks are prepared, the Colonel studies the
     Bone.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel told his Minister
                     of Culture that he could mount
                     a surgical raid to liberate this
                     treasure from Taiwan.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  How much was the Minister
                     told the raid would cost?

                               QIU (not looking up)
                     Counting equipment, personnel,
                     bribes, an even fifty million
                     American.  All in.

                               MAC
                     Which you can now keep.

     The drinks arrive.

                               QIU
                     He would have paid twice that.
                     But my needs are modest.

     And lifts from beneath the table, a leather POUCH.

                               QIU
                     Unlike.  The woman you love.
                     From time to time.

     Drops it into Gin's lap.  She opens the pouch to reveal...

     ...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these
     are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens.
     Slightly larger than the size of a pupil.

     She slips them on.  A bright smile.

                               GIN
                     How do I look, honey?

     And Mac smiles.  In return.

                               MAC
                     Like a woman.  Of mystery.

     INT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

     Glass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the
     harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven.
     And speaking of heaven...

     ...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm,
     part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us
     PAN TO...

     ...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers,
     mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and
     somehow...

     ...tender enough.  To suggest real love.

     LATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and
     food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack
     drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles...

     This is the moment.

                               GIN
                     In the Hong Kong and Shanghai
                     Bank Building.  Is a room with
                     two computers.  One for you.
                     And one for me.

                               MAC
                     Glad I have a function, here.

                               GIN
                     The room is a vault on the 14th
                     floor.  Access codes to that room
                     are changed daily, computer pass-
                     words on the hour, but...

     But.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her.

                               GIN
                     Four men in the world.  Don't need
                     codes.  Their retinas will scan to
                     unlock everything.  One of these is
                     China's Minister of Finance.

     She lifts the goggles...

                               MAC
                     And his retinal plate is in there.

     Yep.

                               MAC
                     Our trade for the great train
                     robbery.  All right, let's say
                     we're in the door.  Now what?

     From her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle.  Opens it to
     reveal a shiny metallic DISC.

                               GIN
                     Hong Kong has a huge portion of its
                     holdings invested in foreign banks.
                     In hundreds of separate accounts...

     Holds up the metallic disc.

                               GIN
                     This CD ROM is programmed to send,
                     instantaneously, thousands of instruc-
                     tions, with all necessary confirmation
                     codes, to transfer reasonably modest
                     sums out of those accounts....

                               MAC
                     Modest.

                               GIN
                     Two or three million at a crack,
                     in odd numbers.  Total, eight
                     billion.  And change.

                               MAC
                     And you've set up a laundry.

                               GIN
                     Every wire transfer gets rocketed
                     through a series of multiple switches,
                     Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel
                     Islands, the Caymans...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Seychelles?

                               GIN (beat)
                     I left that out.

                               MAC
                     You're forgiven.

                               GIN
                     Thank you.  As soon as each deposit
                     lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere
                     else, til the Mafia couldn't find it.

                               MAC
                     But those first instructions,
                     transferring the 8 billion dollars.
                     They're recorded in the main computer.

     She waggles the disc.

                               GIN
                     Nope.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to erase the real transactions.
                     And replace them in its memory
                     with an innocuous loan coded XJ6.
                     Little homage to Limeyland, there.

                               MAC
                     Dearest.  The accounts won't
                     reconcile.

     She waggles the disc.  Again.

                               GIN
                     Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to over-report all account totals
                     forever, in the exact amounts we've
                     lifted.  So the Chinese think the
                     money's still there.

     On this one.  He has to smile.

                               MAC
                     The money.  Is still.  Missing.

                               GIN
                     Sure, the foreign banks know
                     they sent out some money.  But
                     they think Hong Kong knows it,
                     too.  And since we're leaving
                     plenty in every account...

                               MAC
                     The shit doesn't splatter.  Until
                     the first account runs dry.

     Exactly.

                               GIN
                     And then.  Comes the really
                     brilliant part of the whole
                     thing!

                               MAC
                     I was hoping there'd be one.

     He settles back.  Looks at her.

                               GIN
                     Admit it, so far you're
                     blown away.

     Well...

                               MAC
                     It does sound like the beginning
                     of a beautiful friendship.

     And his fingers reach out...

                               MAC
                     Pity it will be over.  In
                     21 hours.

     Touch her hair.  Her face.  She swallows.  A raw moment.  A
     hoarse...

                               GIN
                     Bet you say that.  To all the
                     one-night-stands.

     But he's just staring in her eyes.  The look pins her.  She can't
     wriggle off.  A murmured...

                               MAC
                     No, ma'am...

     He leans to her...

                               MAC
                     Only the best of them.

     They kiss.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE - ROUND MIDNIGHT

     CLOSE on the British Petroleum billboard, where the countdown CLOCK
     says...JUNE 30, 1997, 11:41 P.M., 0 DAYS, 0 HOURS, 18 MINUTES, 51
     SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     The square is beyond BEDLAM.  Times Square looks deserted New
     Year's Eve compared to this carnival CRUSH of humanity, rock and
     rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise.

     Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere,
     firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and
     hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless,
     going absolutely nuts.

     Who knows.  Could be the last party.  Ever.

     WHIP PAN to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass-and-
     steel headquarters of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK.

     ZOOM to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear, Gin with a
     large beaded shoulder bag.  Mac presents an invitation to a PLA
     soldier, who admits them into...

     INT. PUBLIC LOBBY, HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK

     ...a VIP party going full blast in the lobby of this truly
     breathtaking structure.  A central ATRIUM rises 47 floors, creating
     a soaring clear core, around which the offices and working spaces
     are ringed.  The view straight up is interrupted only at three
     well-spaced levels, where thick CANOPIES of glass, stitched
     together with spidery skeletons of steel, SPAN the open core.
     Mac looks up...

     ...at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium, the revelers
     have been granted access to the lower five floors.  Above these,
     all is empty.

                               MAC
                     Nice of the Colonel to provide an
                     invitation...

     She is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors d'oeuvre
     stations.  Half the celebrants seem to be armed PLA soldiers, many
     with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders.

                               GIN
                     Well, I promised him a bonus.
                     Five million.  Comes out of
                     your share.

                               MAC
                     ...long as I don't have to have
                     sex with him.

     Mac loads up on six hors d'oeuvres, piling them on a napkin, as
     she takes two flutes of champagne.  They step away from the mob
     toward a potted plant near the wall, and Mac...

     ...drops his snacks with a SPLAT.  Shit.  Bending to clean the
     mess, he slips from his waistband a flat CIRCUIT BOARD with a
     bank logo and a three-pronged plug.  In a single motion, he plugs
     it INTO a socket concealed by the pot, scoops up his canapes,
     and we CUT TO...

     INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM

     Three SECURITY OFFICERS blink, as ALL FIFTY monitor screens go
     HAYWIRE at once.  The images compressed to a blur of lines between
     a series of diagonal SLACK BARS that slash across the screens.  The
     way your TV acts when the horizontal hold goes out.  They can't
     believe it.

     Stumped, they start slamming buttons, flipping switches, jabbering
     to each other.  Now the images begin to ROLL vertically, as if in
     response to their attempts at adjustment.

     Welcome to the world of high tech.

     INT. ELEVATOR BANK

     Mac and Gin wait with a party of older Brits, who've had plenty
     to drink and are carrying more.  Two armed soldiers flank the
     elevators.  A car arrives.  As the Brits enter...

                               MAC (politely)
                     We'll take the next one.

     Waiting, calmly.  Mac smiles at a soldier.

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     What time tomorrow do the tanks
                     roll in?

     The guy LAUGHS.  An elevator arrives.  Gin sipping champagne as
     they enter.

     The doors CLOSE.  They are alone.  The panel has floors 1 through
     5 lit.  The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark.  There are NO
     numbers 11-15.

     Mac pulls from his pocket a small flat DEVICE, not much thicker
     than a credit card, with a window and a series of LED lights
     on its face.  He fits it into a SLOT beside a black glass PLATE
     on the elevator panel.  Immediately, the LEDs scramble, all RED,
     numbers FLASH across the card's window, as the device begins
     to lock on the elevator code.  In sequence, the LEDs turn GREEN,
     and...

     ...the glass plate LIGHTS, announcing in Kanji and English...ACCES
     GRANTED TO FLOORS 11, 12, 14, 15.  Mac presses the lit number 14.

     The elevator RISES.  He looks over at her.  She is tight enough
     to snap.  We can feel her heart racing from here.

                               MAC
                     So all that time, sitting at your
                     computers.  All the research, the
                     access codes your job allowed you
                     to steal, floor plans, schematics...
                     setting up all your bank accounts...

     She looks irritated.  He is smiling, gently.

                               MAC
                     Years of work, comes down to....
                               (checks his watch)
                     ...six minutes.  Don't be
                     nervous.  Easy come, easy go.

     She looks away.  The elevator stops.

                               MAC
                     Your share prob'ly works out
                     to, what?  Dollar and a quarter
                     an hour?

     Me laughs.  The door opens.  She is pissed off.

                               GIN
                     What's your point?

                               MAC (very real)
                     That I like you, Ginger.

     Now they're staring at each other.  An open elevator door.  An
     empty dim hallway.  They see only each other.

                               MAC
                     The dedication, the skill,
                     the guts...

     He holds out the crook of his arm.  As a gentleman escorts a lady.

                               MAC
                     I'm going to see you get
                     everything you deserve.

     Her eyes flicker on that.  So he grins...

                               MAC
                     Woman.  If you can't have
                     fun, right now.  You're in
                     the wrong business.

     She looks in his eyes.  Her body seems to relax, just a little.
     She takes his arm.

     INT. 14TH FLOOR

     CLOSE on a KEYPAD.  Next to it, a mirrored PLATE with two
     APERTURES, set apart the distance of human eyes.  Gin's goggled
     face DROPS into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface.  She
     fits her eyes to the apertures...

                               GIN (whispers)
                     Open.  Sesame.

     A red scanning light APPEARS.  Tracks vertically.  BEEPS.  Tracks
     horizontally.  And from somewhere...

     ...a soft CLICK.  PULL BACK now, to see...

     They stand at what seems the door to a BANK VAULT.  Round,
     gigantic, heavy steel.  Bolts eyerywhere.  Mac reaches to GRASP
     the handle, and...

     CLANG.  The door swings OPEN.  They stare at the inner sanctum...

     ...a windowless ROOM.  Dim, eerie fluorescence.  A blast of white
     noise from the elaborate air-cooling system.  Two large MAINFRAME
     COMPUTERS face each other from opposite walls, desks and work
     stations with PC monitors filling the space between.  As Mac closes
     the vault door behind them...

     ...Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe.  Pulls the high-
     resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm.  The screensaver
     displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish.  She hits a
     key.  The screen saver replaced by, WELCOME.  AUTHORIZATION MODE
     PLEASE.  Two boxes for PASSWORD and SCAN.  She hits SCAN.  A
     plastic shield RISES, revealing...

     ...the mirrored PLATE, the tiny APERTURES.  Gin leans to fit her
     goggled eyes in place.  The red scanning light.  Vertical track.
     BEEP.  Horizontal track.  And the monitor announces...WELCOME
     MINISTER FEIHONG.  Gin takes off the goggles, and...

     ...THROWS them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe.  As
     he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious CD-ROM
     into her mainframe's driver.  Watches the screen...

                               GIN
                     Uploading.  And you've got...
                     two minutes, fifty seconds.

     WITH Mac now.  Typing the words CONTROL PANEL.  The screen now
     shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a
     CLOCK in the center of the screen, labeled LOCAL TIME, and reading
     11:57:19, changing with each second that passes...

                               MAC
                     So let's see.  Across town at
                     the British Consulate...

     INTERCUT...frenzied activity in a large war room filled with
     computers, wall screens, every worker functioning at top speed...
     CONTINUE to hear Mac over this...

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...everyone is working frantically
                     to complete transactions before
                     they go off-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create a
     clock at the LEFT of the screen, labeled BRITISH TERMINAL TIME.
     It is, of course, showing the same time as the local clock.

                               MAC
                     ...then, deep in the high-tech
                     bowels of the Bank of China
                     Building, just across the square...

     INTERCUT...an even larger war room, even better staffed and
     equipped.  Everyone...doing...nothing.  Staring at blank monitors
     and wall screens.

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...the Chinese are sitting on
                     their thumbs, waiting to come
                     on-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create
     another clock at the RIGHT of the screen, labeled CHINA TERMINAL
     TIME.  Shows the same time as the other clocks.  11:58:22.

                               MAC
                     I feel for these boys.  Let's
                     give them a breather, hmmn?

     CLICKS the mouse, and the BRITISH TERMINAL TIME begins FLASHING.

                               MAC
                     We'll let the Brits go off-line
                     4 seconds early.

     As the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and Mac HITS the key four
     times, advancing the British clock to 34 seconds, four seconds
     later than the others.

                               MAC
                     And we'll give our new Chinese
                     overlords 4 extra seconds of rest
                     before they have to go on-line.

     As the local and Chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, Mac HITS the key
     four times, regressing the Chinese clock back to 36 seconds.

     We watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of
     British rule.  The British clock is 4 seconds FAST, the Chinese
     clock 4 seconds SLOW.

                               MAC
                     Playing God here, Ginger.  We've
                     created 8 seconds that do not
                     exist, anywhere but in this room.

     LOCAL TIME...11:59:00.  One minute to midnight.

                               MAC
                     8 seconds, where no one is on-line
                     but your little CD-Rom.

     He turns around.  Her eyes are waiting.  Across the room.

                               MAC
                     And when, eventually, everyone
                     discovers what transaction XJ6
                     was really about...

                               GIN
                     China will think it happened
                     before midnight.  Britain will
                     swear it happened after midnight...

                               MAC
                     They'll each be positive.  The
                     other guy.  Did it.

     Mac sighs.  This is a sad thing.

                               MAC
                     Liable to be an ugly international
                     incident.

     She squints across at his clock.

                               GIN
                     Britain off-line in 18 seconds.
                     We're bulletproof.

     His smile returns.  Bittersweet and real...

                               MAC
                     Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is
                     bulletproof.  Ever.

     The look holds.  He turns back to his screen.  She lingers on him
     for an instant.  Then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above
     her ENTER key...

                               MAC
                     Britain goes bye-bye in 6...
                     5...4...3.

     INTERCUT...The British Consulate.  All screens go DARK.  A logo
     APPEARS of a POPPING Champagne BOTTLE, whose spray forms a Union
     Jack twined with a PRC flag, everyone SHOUTS, cheers or curses, and
     we SMASH CUT...

     BACK to Gin...striking ENTER, the screen flashing TRANSACTIONS XJ6
     PROCESSING.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Jesus God, it's going through.

                               MAC (watching his clocks)
                     Hong Kong midnight, happy new year.
                     Except at China Bank.

                               GIN (to her screen)
                     C'mon, c'mon...

     Her screen flashes TRANSACTIONS XJ6 COMPLETED, hear her SHRIEK of
     ecstasy, as we...

     INTERCUT...Bank of China where dark screens suddenly LIGHT with the
     same stupid PARTY LOGO.  Only nobody cheers.  They just get to
     work.

     BACK TO the vault...

                               MAC
                     Feel like a nightcap?

     But across the way, Gin is JAMMING a button.  Again.  Again.

                               GIN
                     The CD won't come out of
                     the driver.

     Houston.  We have a problem.

                               MAC
                     Relax, don't jam it...

                               GIN (jamming it)
                     FUCKING THING!!

     He crosses the room.  She's rummaging on a nearby desk, finds a
     LETTER OPENER.

                               MAC
                     Don't panic, now, there's no rush...

                               GIN
                     We can't leave it IN THERE, it's
                     got all our accounts, everything
                     that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!

     She's fitting the letter opener INTO the narrow slot above the lid
     of the driver.

                               MAC
                     Easy with that, there's no ru...

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Every SIREN in the skyscraper is
     SHRIEKING, lights are FLASHING CRIMSON, Gin's screen says SECURITY
     BREACH in a selection of languages.

     Gin just staring at it.

                               GIN
                     There's a rush.

     The sirens are EAR-SPLITTING.  We know that elsewhere in this
     building, all hell must be breaking loose.  Gin is YANKING Mac's
     arm out of the socket...

                               GIN
                     LET'S MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU
                     WAITING F...

                               MAC
                     The disc.  Is still in there.

     Yeh.  She stares at it.  Really scared.

                               GIN
                     We can't help it, we...we've
                     gotta...

     He stares at her.  In one motion, he SNATCHES a stapler from the
     desk and SMASHES the driver with all his strength.

     It pops open.  Calmly, he plucks her CD from the tray.  She mouths
     a barely audible...

                               GIN
                     What a guy.

     But just as she's about to bolt...he holds up one hand.  Slips
     another CD from his pocket.  We see the words KENNY G.

                               MAC
                     Was wondering where to leave
                     this...

     Pops it IN the drive.  SLAMS it shut.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Time to go.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mac and Gin RUNNING full tilt through the siren BLARE, turning a
     corner to see ahead...

     ...the balcony railing, the building's empty central CORE.  Mac
     BOLTS straight TOWARD it, Gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding,
     they reach the railing, looking DOWN to see...

     Hysteria, unimaginable chaos.  Soldiers, black-tie partygoers,
     SCRAMBLING in all directions, looking to his left Mac sees...

     ...the bank of ELEVATORS, soldiers POURING in, some cars already
     RISING, fourth floor, fifth.  Now he looks directly BELOW, where...

     ...soldiers are POUNDING up the metal service staircase, the front
     rank almost at the third floor.  In the lobby, some faces look up
     to see us, but no one is shooting.

                               GIN
                     They don't know we're the
                     bad guys.

     He PLUNGES his hand into her shoulder bag...

                               MAC
                     Time they find out.

     Pulls OUT two PLASMA GRENADES, and FLINGS one toward the elevator
     cables three floors down and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, causing PANDEMONIUM in the
     lobby below, the elevator cables BLOWN AWAY, cars PLUNGING, the
     yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below,
     and Mac HURLS the second grenade...

     ...STRAIGHT DOWN and the fireball WIPES OUT the staircase, a huge
     section of ninth floor landing RAINING down on the lobby.

                               GIN
                     Okay.  How do we get down?

                               MAC
                     Down?  I never liked down.

     Grabs her hand and they RACE to the staircase, as smoke BILLOWS
     everywhere below.  UP they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest
     glass-and-spiderweb-steel CANOPY is three floors above us, the
     cacophany of SHOUTS below is like an amplified insane asylum.

     He is dragging her now, up, up, BULLETS are flying blind through
     the smoke, CHEWING up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and
     as the smoke at last clears, they have reached...

     ...the canopy floor.  They can see the army down below.  Clutching
     her hand, Mac leads her OVER the railing, ONTO the canopy itself,
     and together they RUN...

     ...straight ACROSS the heavy glass toward the far side of the
     building, like space-walking above the throng 150 feet below,
     BULLETS now TRACING their path from beneath, SLAMMING OFF the
     underside of the bulletproof canopy, Gin SHRIEKING with fright
     as they go.  We see ahead...

     ...three EXECUTIVE ELEVATORS beginning to climb the far wall.
     These are glass-enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car
     in the lead already at the tenth floor.  Mac keeps running straight
     TOWARD them.

                               GIN (out of breath)
                     WE'VE GOT ONE MORE GRENADE!

                               MAC (not)
                     SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY!

     They make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two
     floors below them.  We can see the soldiers through the glass.  Mac
     GRASPS her hand, and as the car nears our level...

                               MAC
                     You can do this.

     They LEAP across five feet of open air to...

     ...LAND squarely on the car's metal roof, Mac WRAPPING his free arm
     AROUND the cable, and UP we go.  The ant colony below us receding
     fast.

     Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified.  Mac is looking up toward
     the roof.

                               GIN
                     Okay, now what?

                               MAC (absently)
                     Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to-
                     know' basis.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm sorry.

     He looks at her.  Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid.

                               GIN
                     Turns out, I'm a screw-up.

     He doesn't smile.  Passing the third canopy.

                               MAC
                     Well.  Something to be said for
                     being self-aware.

     Looks back up.  Forty-first floor.  Six to go.

                               MAC
                     May I have the last grenade, dear.
                     It's about to rain.

     She blinks.  Huh?  So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the
     grenade, and THROWS it...

     ...STRAIGHT up.  The roof above them EXPLODES in a FIREBALL, and
     SHIELDS her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge SECTION
     of roof comes RAINING down.  We watch as it...

     ...CRASHES through the upper canopy, TONS of roof and glass
     PLUNGING to...

     ...BLAST through the middle canopy, everyone below SCRAMBLING for
     shelter, as the whole shebang...

     ...EXPLODES through the lowest canopy.  Gin can only GAPE at the
     incredible display.  Mouthing a silent WOW.

     They've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor.  Still
     climbing.  The other two elevators maybe five floors below us.

                               MAC
                     You see, banking will be more
                     democratic under China.

     She looks to him.

                               MAC
                     Well.  No more glass ceiling.

     The elevator car has STOPPED.  We are at the roof.  The soldiers
     are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out.  Above our
     heads.

     ...the last few feet of elevator cable.  And starry sky, where our
     patch of roof used to be.

                               MAC
                     How refreshing.  The night air.

     He begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable.  At the top, he
     reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof,
     GRABS it, LUNGES with his free hand, and...

     ...DANGLING 47 floors, he pulls himself UP, swings ONTO the roof.
     Reaches back down.  She is only twelve feet below him.  Frozen with
     fear.

                               GIN
                     I can't do this.

                               MAC
                     You can.  If I say so.

     She stares up at his eyes.  He smiles.

                               MAC
                     If you stay.  You'll have to pay
                     for the damage...

     She looks down at the mess below.

     And starts to climb the cable.  Not so easy in a ball gown, but the
     adrenaline is pumping.  Gets to the top.  Here's the hard part.
     One hand reaches out...

     ...GRABS his.  She lets GO.  And she is DANGLING in space.

                               MAC
                     Now that split.  Did we say
                     60-40?

     And with all his strength, hauls her up onto...

     ...the roof.  Two-thirds of it remain.  At the far edge, a gigantic
     MAINTENANCE CRANE, itself two stories high.  But between here and
     the crane...

     ...a HELICOPTER.  Big and beautifUl and empty.  She looks like
     she's seen God.  Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow
     but sees him go...

     ...straight PAST the chopper.

                               GIN
                     HEY!

     He turns back.

     She points to the copter.  It's over here.

                               MAC
                     Got the keys?

     Oh.

                               GIN
                     I thought you could...hot-wire
                     stuff?

     Guess not.

                               MAC
                     They fix those things so you
                     can't steal them...

     And keeps walking.  Toward the monster CRANE.

                               MAC
                     These, they're not so worried.

     Moving fast, he points off to his right.  Her eyes follow a
     long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof,
     attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL.

                               MAC
                     Go grab that hook.

     He reaches the crane's cab.  Turns back to see she hasn't moved.

                               MAC
                     Let me rephrase that.  Run
                     and grab that hook.  Or die...

     Got it?  She takes off running.  He hops IN the cab.  PUSHES the
     start button.  It rumbles to life.  Tests some levers...

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     SHIT!  DON'T DO THAT!

     He turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six
     feet in the AIR.  She clings to the hook with a true death grip.
     He lowers her ball to the roof.  Getting the hang of it.

                               MAC
                     This only works if you shut
                     your eyes.

     Which makes her eyes BUG OUT.

                               GIN
                     You're not gonna lower me over
                     the side.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  Now close baby
                     eyes...
                               (she won't)
                     Suit yourself.

     He THROWS a lever and the crane's arm begins to SWING in a circle,
     finally taking the ball WITH it, and as she SCREAMS, Mac...

     ...POUNCES out of the cab, RACING along the edge of the roof, NOT
     toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical Gin in a widening
     ARC, but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the
     edge, and JUST as it does, he...

     ...LEAPS aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around
     her, and they go...

     ...OVER the side, WHOOSHING DOWN in a gigantic, every-increasing
     LOOP, as the endless steel cable UNWINDS from its huge drum like a
     fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale.

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOOOOOO....

     The ride no theme park could insure, SWOOPING out ACROSS the
     skyline, DROPPING like an anvil, as the cable UNSPOOLS hundreds of
     feet, nothing but NOTHING for miles below them, Gin grabbing a
     breath to SHRIEK her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches
     its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless
     instant...

                               MAC
                     Let go NOW!!

     He YANKS her loose, and they drop...

     ...four feet.  The ball SWINGS OFF lnto space to some unknown
     mayhem.  Clutching Mac, Gin looks WAY down to the street, and
     realizes they are standing on...

     ...a rooftop.  Quiet, safe.  Alone.

                               MAC
                     Planning.

     She WHIPS around, GLARING death at his eyes.

                               MAC
                     And dumb luck.

     She COLLAPSES in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm,
     sobbing...

                               GIN
                     God, I hate you.

     He holds her tenderly.  Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Good.  I hate you, too.

     EXT. NATHAN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

     WITH Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all
     across her shoulder.  Very early, even the busiest street in the
     world is less than that at this hour.  Up ahead...

     ...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag,
     leaning casually against a pole.  Talking into a cellular.

     As she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear
     his conversation...

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...if I can't have my usual
                     suite, I'll take my business
                     to the Bristol, simple as that.

     He sees her now.  Smiles small.

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...why indeed should I be more
                     loyal to you than you've been to
                     me?  Think it over.

     SNAPS the phone shut.

                               MAC
                     You ran your calls.

     She did.  She is frankly exhilarated.

                               GIN
                     All the transactions, all the
                     transfers.  It's a miracle.

                               MAC
                     Why?  The CD erased the trans-
                     actions, all accounts seem in
                     order.  It looks like the thieves
                     were stopped in time.

     She sighs.  It is a miracle.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel says police have
                     nothing.  A man in black-tie, a
                     blonde in a gown.  The elevator
                     guards saw faces, but no mug shots
                     to ID.  I think it's over.

     Mac's smile.  Bittersweet affection.

                               MAC
                     Except it never is, really.
                     Quite.  Over.

     She smiles.  It is easy, but dazzling.  Atypically soft.

                               GIN
                     Well, one hopes not.  The Bristol,
                     huh?  In...Paris?

     Ah.

                               MAC
                     You're not going back to Mr. Cruz,
                     and the nine-to-five?

                               GIN
                     Not hardly.  I've arranged to be
                     killed in a car crash.  On Taipei.
                     Amazing how little it costs.

                               MAC
                     Well.  You want to watch those
                     pennies.

     She takes a breath.  Scared, in an excited way...

                               GIN
                     I could arrange for two.  In that
                     crash.

     His smile back.

     He looks at his watch.  Takes her hand.  Leads her to the subway
     steps.

                               MAC
                     You know, for a bitch.  You can
                     be awfully sweet.

                               GIN
                     Woman of mystery.  What do you say?
                     I like the Bristol, just fine.
                     mean, it's not the Ritz...

                               MAC
                     You know, all night I've been
                     wrestling with something...

                               GIN
                     Not the most flattering way to
                     put it.

     He takes his big tourist shopping bag.  Puts it in her hand.

                               MAC
                     I've changed your travel plans.

     They are descending now.  Into the vast underground train station.

                               GIN
                     Mine.

                               MAC
                     Instead of taking the subway to
                     the airport, you change at Jordan
                     Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that?

     Got that?

                               MAC
                     Jordan is only 90 seconds up the
                     line.  Like a wire transfer, you're
                     gone.  Vanished.

     He holds up a silencing finger.  Listen to me.

                               MAC
                     In this bag are passports,
                     tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a
                     good one.  A dress you can slip on
                     in five seconds.

     Her eyes moving over his face.  What is this?

                               MAC
                     You're on a tight connection to
                     the Trans-Siberian Express, be in
                     Europe in a week.

                               GIN
                     Mac, wh...

                               MAC
                     Shhh.  You always talk too much.

     They're at the booth.  He pays their fare.  Through the turnstiles,
     now.

                               MAC
                     Time has come to return the favor.
                     One last time.

     Smiles at her.  As they enter a tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Tell you.  What business.  I'm
                     actually in.

     And in an instant of blind panicked clarity.  She gets the whole
     thing.

                               GIN (hushed)
                     My God.  You're a cop.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     That's my girl.

     Keep walking.  People are everywhere.  But they are alone in the
     world.

                               MAC
                     See, my profession was cover,
                     too.  A notorious thief has access
                     to colleagues, their plans...

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     I've turned in...well, couple
                     hundred.  over forty years.
                     Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI...

     Looking around the tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Thought I might retire.  After you.

                               GIN
                     And all the...microchips, the
                     diamond machine...

                               MAC
                     Well, the chips were returned.
                     The machine was just a box, did
                     you actually think it was real?

     Glances at her.

                               GIN
                     I thought...everything was real.
                     Stupid girl.

     End of the tunnel in sight now.  It leads to a massive, endless
     quai.  Trains in transit.

                               GIN
                     Those were your jobs, so I could
                     have claimed entrapment.  You had
                     to wait.  For mine.

     Nearly there.  He says nothing.  Looks pretty grim.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bone...

                               MAC
                     Well, the State Department liked
                     that one.  They have more fish to
                     fry with Beijing than Taiwan.

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     So they're taking credit for
                     letting it go through.  Tho I'm
                     afraid your Colonel may be in for
                     a career disappointment.

     She stops walking.  She has to know...

                               GIN
                     And the 5 billion.

     Ah.  That.

                               MAC
                     I haven't told them.

     Gently, takes her arm.  Leads her onto the endless train platform.
     Walking slower now.

                               MAC
                     I said you hadn't revealed the
                     job.  That it wouldn't take place
                     until after the changeover.

     Down the platform they stroll.  As her eyes wander...

                               MAC
                     Don't look, they're there.

     Her breath catches.  Her eyes go down.

                               GIN
                     And my tickets.  In the shopping bag?

                               MAC
                     Well.  Kept my options open.  If
                     I give you up, they don't matter,
                     do they?

     Her heart pounding through her chest.

                               GIN
                     If.

                               MAC
                     Had lots of crazy thoughts.  One
                     was retirement.  With four billion
                     dollars.  After all, I know some
                     places where life could be private...

                               GIN
                     But you couldn't do that, huh?

     They've stopped.  Just two travellers in a strange land.  waiting
     for a train.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise.  They wouldn't be here.

     He nods.  Smiling pleasantly.

                               MAC
                     Creature of habit.  I suppose.

     We feel her adrenaline racing.

                               GIN
                     Lots.  Of thoughts, you s...

                               MAC
                     Keep smiling.  They won't move,
                     until I raise my left arm.

     And so she smiles.  As prettily as she can manage.

                               MAC
                     I thought.  Well, I've got the CD.
                     I could contact the banks, reverse
                     all the transactions...

     A train is COMING.  We HEAR it.

                               MAC
                     ...except maybe.  Leave you with...
                     oh, a hundred million, say.  To
                     tide you over.

     SEE the train.  Slowing.  Pulling in.

                               MAC
                     Then, I thought, nah.  Not my style.

     With a SHRIEK of metal.  The train PULLS toward us.

                               MAC
                     I figured.  What the hell?

     What the hell?

                               MAC
                     Let her keep the lot.

     The train STOPS.  The doors OPEN.  People come out, people go in.
     Pouring around them.  They are alone again.  The subway doors stand
     open.  Two feet away.  She looks at them...

                               MAC
                     No rush.  The doors won't close for
                     60 seconds.

     Sixty seconds.  And still smiling...

                               MAC
                     There's a pistol in the bag.  Reach
                     in slowly.  Take it out fast.  Point
                     it at my temple.

     She freezes to stone.

                               MAC
                     You can do it.  If I say you can.

     And she...DOES IT.  A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head,
     Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we...

     WHIP PAN to see.  Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close.
     They REACT, pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off.  BACK TO...
         
     Two people. Alone in the universe.

                               MAC
                     Step onto the car, keep the
                     pistol trained on my face.

     She hesitates.  Does as he says.  Passengers are screaming,
     cringing, bolting for other cars.  Our world is FROZEN.  His hands
     raised...

                               MAC
                     Seems I was wrong.

     Gentle smile.

                               MAC
                     Entrapment.  Is what robbers.
                     Do to cops, huh?

     Her eyes are flooding.  The gun is trembling.

                               MAC
                     Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the
                     shoulder, it'll slow them down.

     Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy.  Tears are on her cheeks.

                               GIN
                     Oughta shoot you in the face.

                               MAC
                     Come on, you can do it, if I sa...

                               GIN
                     No way.  Not anymore.

     She sobs.  She can't stand this.

                               MAC
                     Ten seconds, hold on.

                               GIN
                     When do I see you?

     There is no answer.  There are no words.

     The doors HISS SHUT.  She stares, training her pistol on him
     through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents,
     and the train...

     PULLS away.  An instant to pick up speed, and it ROARS into a
     tunnel.  Gone.

     Mac stands motionless as ALL HELL breaks loose around him, AGENTS
     rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly...
         
     Still staring after the train.

                               MAC
                     Airport.  Changing at Mongkok
                     Station, we can cut her off.

     Walkie-talkies WHIP out.  These guys are the same the world over.
     We begin to CRANE UP...

                               MAC
                     She might lose the wig, be looking
                     brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...

                               AGENT
                     I think Yaumatei changes for the
                     airport, and it's closer.

     Keep PULLING UP, an AERIAL VIEW now, too high to see their faces...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I think you're wrong, but cover it.
                     You got maybe four minutes.

     HIGHER still, the mob below an ant colony...

                               MAC (O.S., calmly)
                     No problem.  She's trapped.

     But as the crowd parts.  We can make out one lone man...

     Staring after.  What has gone.

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT

     Lake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic,
     minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of...

     ...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark
     up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can
     just make out...

     ...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel
     surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see...

     The THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored
     helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb-
     ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt.
     Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible?
     CLOSER still to see...

     ...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel
     to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the
     bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is
     remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision,
     until...

     ...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the
     100th floor.  Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures,
     in a cavernous coldly-decorated space.

     Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the
     steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner
     clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is
     placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the
     glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the
     rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and
     the window...

     ...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly
     sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind,
     and the Thief slips...

     ...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its
     60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief
     attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of
     possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until...

     ...the right one STOPS.  Illuminated in red.  The beeping, the
     green light, go OFF.  The device is removed.

     Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction-
     mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig
     in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling
     window pane.  A small remote control clicker...

     ...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now
     supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled
     INTO the apartment in a single tug.  The WHINE of a motor, and the
     pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place.

     No trace of entry.

     Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle,
     the Thief SCANS...

     ...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix,
     Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft
     lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity
     perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to
     end at the horizon.

     The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin-
     drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly
     through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German
     expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis
     Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE,
     we enter...

     ...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper-
     plated commode, and across from these...

     ...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master.
     A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient
     bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously...

     ...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes.
     Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube,
     pulling out...

     ...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this,
     fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame.
     Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor.
     Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube.
     Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement
     canvas...

     A cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown.

     WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is
     a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL.
     The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps...

     ...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating,
     and...

     Disappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating
     seamlessly into place.

     INT. VENT

     Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the
     narrow space, arriving at...

     ...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100
     floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly,
     the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from
     the backpack, and simply...

     LEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an
     instant...

     ...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place,
     suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the
     Thief...

     ...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL,
     until a cord is tugged and...

     ...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting
     lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for...

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER - LATE NIGHT

     Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE
     ANGLE now to see in far distance...

     ...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown
     Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering
     miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on...

     ...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit
     window to see...

     ...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP
     to...

     VIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the
     Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the
     Tower, to...

     The street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta.
     Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off...

     We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door
     OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it...

     Closes.  Softly.

     INT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - DAY

     A basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the
     bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell
     unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the
     hurried side of brisk.

     HECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat
     Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches.
     Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering...

     NO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle
     below the words.  He holds his hand up to it...

     Nothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased
     slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters...

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     An unexpectedly VAST semi-circular room, the entire inner circum-
     ference made up of a single continuous WALL SCREEN, separated into
     a seamless array of IMAGES...

     Three-dimensional rotating GRAPHICS of every room in the Hancock
     Tower Penthouse, SCHEMATICS of electrical, plumbing, and ventila-
     tion systems.  See-through rotating multicolored models of every
     piece of security EQUIPMENT imaginable, components FLASHING as
     performance simulations are run.  Rapid-fire sequences of indiv-
     idual human PROFILES, complete with photos and bio blurbs.  Screens
     flickering with blizzards of DATA, hurtling past at warp speed.

     The Pentagon and CNN would kill for this room.

     The largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a LIVE FEED
     from the crime scene.  The living room of the Penthouse, crawling
     with slow-moving cops and technicians, doing their slow-moving
     thing.  Surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing
     this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles.  All live.
     We see the library, the mail chute.  The powder room.  Bozo.

     Cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate CONTROL
     STATIONS, each outfitted with super-tech panels to process the
     avalanche of information.  But today, all stations are empty.

     Except one.

                               CRUZ
                     Baker.  You got it solved?

     And now we see her.  From the rear.  Slouched at her station.
     Looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled
     oversized workshirt, vintage jeans.

                               GIN (O.S., from the rear)
                     Actually.  Yeh.

     Not a kid's voice.  Throaty.  Music and whiskey and sex and
     effortless confidence.  Even the voice turns us on.

                               CRUZ (glances at his watch)
                     What took you so long, Gin?  I
                     called 4:30 this morn...

     And stops.  Because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone
     to stone.

                               GIN
                     I was with someone, all right?

     Now we really see her.  Delicate bones and features, slender body,
     radiating the power of a natural heart-stopping beauty.  GINGER
     BAKER is 32, ethereal and feral at once.  Electric green eyes
     crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked
     with.

                               CRUZ
                     So?  This is work.

     He is not kidding.  Stainless steel beneath the dapper.  They are a
     matched team.

                               GIN
                     Hector, I hardly know the guy.
                     Why be impolite to strangers?

     And he smiles.  Maybe she's lying.  He likes her.

                               CRUZ
                     Look at those assholes...

     He means the cops on live feed.

                               CRUZ
                     If the Vermeer were lying on that
                     table, they'd toss their doughnuts
                     on it.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, well, they didn't insure it,
                     so they don't have to solve this.
                     To them it's a crime.  To us it's 24
                     mil, less re-insurance, which is...

                               CRUZ (grim)
                     Only thirty percent, Gin.

     Ouch.  Really?

                               CRUZ
                     Which is why you're on this.

     Soft and straight.  You're the best.  I need you.

                               GIN
                     He came in through the window.

                               CRUZ
                     That's not possib...

                               GIN
                     What's not possible is entry through
                     the doors or the vents.  That would
                     have triggered instant alarm.

                               CRUZ
                     The windows are wired, too.

                               GIN
                     Only for trauma.  They used smart
                     glass, where the sensors respond to
                     violation of the panel's integrity.

     He's listening.  He always does with her.

                               GIN
                     I think he scaled the wall, popped
                     the frame.  In one piece.

     She sounds awfully positive.  Then again, she always does.

                               GIN
                     Then, he only had to deal with
                     heat and motion sensors.  They
                     were on 60-second delay, so the
                     owner wouldn't trigger the alarm
                     just be walking arou...

                               CRUZ
                     The pane weighs 200 pounds, the
                     building's 1100 feet high.

                               GIN
                     This particular guy is the best.
                     The best there ever was.

     Almost as if she knows who.  Cruz shakes his head...

                               CRUZ
                     Popping the frame would trigger
                     the alarm.

     She smiles.  First time.  Even at one-tenth power, it is dazzling
     light.  She touches the panel before her...

                               GIN (gently)
                     I wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo.

     The live feed is replaced by a red-outlined rotating three-
     dimensional DIAGRAM of the living room.  The alarm box glows green.
     One window pane glows lavender.  She touches the panel, and the
     window SHATTERS, the alarm instantly emits a PIERCING SCREECH.

     Reset.  As he watches.  This time the window SLIDES AWAY into
     thin air.  No sound.  A stick figure appears, crawls through the
     opening, and the alarm begins the slow BEEP we heard last night.
     Cruz just stares.

                               GIN
                     Here's how I figured it out...

     Live feed replaces the diagram.  Our camera ZOOMS toward a VASE of
     lilies by the window.  All the flowers are tilted in one direction.
     Over the lip of the vase, away from the window.

                               GIN
                     No one arranges flowers like that.
                     It was the draft from the window.

     He turns to her.

                               CRUZ
                     You said.  This particular guy.

     Now she is beaming.  Excited.  And just above a whisper...

                               GIN
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Delighted at his stupefied reaction.

                               CRUZ
                     Why not Houdini?  Or Pretty Boy
                     Floyd?  Maybe Jesus Christ.

                               GIN
                     Because they couldn't do it.

     His slow smile.  This fucking kid.

                               CRUZ
                     He's been out of the business.
                     For ten years.

                               GIN
                     Maybe not.  No one ever proved,
                     hell, even arrested him, for
                     stealing anything.  But we all
                     know he was numero ichiban for
                     thirty years.  Why not forty?

     She's serious.

                               CRUZ
                     Why?  Because of the Bozo switch?
                     Guys have been copying his pack-
                     rat signature for decades.  Maybe
                     the thief wanted it to look like
                     MacDougal.

     She doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of the
     data screens BLOWS UP to huge size.  It is...

                               GIN
                     A list of his private collection.
                     Complete to three acquisitions
                     last Thursday.

     Names SCROLLING up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions,
     estimated retail and black market values.  Turner, Corot, Thomas
     Coles, DeKooning, Klimt, Cezannes, Odilon Redon, Braques, Mary
     Cassatt...

                               CRUZ
                     No Vermeer.  Nothing close.

                               GIN
                     Don't be a putz.  This is his
                     legitimate collection, which he
                     buys.  Presentable for any search
                     warrant surprise party.

     Names keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee.  Amazing.

                               GIN
                     What he rips off, he fences.  And
                     the money feeds his portfolio of
                     investments, which are daring, savvy,
                     and obscenely succesf...

                               CRUZ
                     Oh, I get it.  He has no interest
                     in Vermeers, so that proves he stole
                     one.  By that logic, he oughta be a
                     suspect most of the time.

     She shakes her head, sadly.

                               GIN
                     You love to embarrass yourself.

     Touches her panel.  The big screen now shows a grainy VIDEOTAPE
     of...

                               GIN
                     The auction.  Where our client
                     bought the painting...

     We see the Great Room of an English Country estate.  Perhaps a
     hundred attend.  Genteel to the max.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire,
                     four weeks ago.

     The tape PANS five PAINTINGS on the block.  We recognize our
     VERMEER, the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge.  The view PULLS
     BACK to include the crowd, and...

     FREEZES.  One tiny section is circled.  And BLOWS UP twenty feet.
     high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable.  Then, SNAPS to amazing
     resolution.  The image of...

                               GIN (O.S., murmur)
                     Anyone we know?

     ...ANDREW MacDOUGAL, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly
     virile a face as one can recall.  Etched with character and worldly
     experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze.  Tall,
     wide shoulders, massive hands.  This guy would be more fun to fuck
     than fight.  By a lot.

                               CRUZ
                     So he was there.

                               GIN
                     Staking it out.  Why bid, when
                     you can mark the buyer, and jack
                     it within the month?

     She leans WAY back in the molded chair.  Lifts her long legs
     up onto the console.  They end in slender bare feet.  The toes
     wriggle.

                               GIN
                     At this moment, he is winging on
                     JAL flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly
                     to attend a prestigious auction at
                     the Hotel Akura, which will include
                     a mixed media collage/oil by Georges
                     Braques, on which he supposedly has
                     his eye.

                               CRUZ
                     But you know better.

                               GIN
                     Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds.

     Touches the panel.  The big screen now holds three faces, three
     names.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Research reveals three known fences,
                     still at large, who are believed
                     to have brokered Vermeers to black
                     market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is
                     hospitalized in Malta with ovarian
                     cancer.

     One face and name disappears.  Two remain.  KOICHI NARUHITO.
     HIROYUKI YAMAJI.

                               GIN
                     The other two.  Live in Tokyo.

     A tiny, dry, adorable, shrug.  Which says, bingo.

                               CRUZ
                     And you did all this since 4:30
                     this morning.

     Grinning small at each other.  She can't help that hers is hot.
     She never can.

                               CRUZ (murmur)
                     Plus.  You were polite to a
                     stranger.

     One of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to
     ignore.  Best to defuse by pretending it's a joke...

                               GIN (soft and playful)
                     Sounds like you're sorry you're
                     already a friend.

     Said as banter between pals.  Which doesn't make her wrong.

     INT. HOTEL OKURA, TOKYO - NIGHT

     Auction in progress in the huge traditional LOBBY, where bonsai
     trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint
     the sleek, international, big-money crowd.  Everyone milling,
     drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up
     on the raised platform...

     ...the AUCTIONEER has a new piece on the block, a 6th Century
     temple scroll, from the Asuka period.  It is exquisite, and bidding
     seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the
     overhead DIGITAL DISPLAY, which reveals bidding status in thirty
     currencies simultaneously. As we PAN the hall, we see...

     ...all non-Asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by
     personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid-fire
     auctioneer.

     Except one.

     ANDREW MacDOUGAL stands alone in black tie.  Tall and rugged and
     polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous.  He is bidding on
     the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and
     the repeated finger-stabs of the auctioneer in our direction.

                               WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S., subtitled Japanese)
                     Don't do it.

     PULL BACK slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder.
     She is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale
     golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly.  Breathtaking would
     be an insult.

     MacDougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her.  Just raises
     his program to up the bid.

                               GIN (softly, subtitled Japanese)
                     You're already over value.  By
                     15 percent.

     And now he turns.  Straight to her eyes.  This is NOT an admiring
     glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the Northern Hemisphere.
     It is a look that says, in the most understated terms, shut up or
     I'll kill you.  She shuts up.

     His glance goes to his obvious bidding RIVAL, a rather butch
     middle-aged Chinese woman in an embroidered version of a Mao suit.
     She indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny Yorkshire Terrier,
     whom she holds in her stubby hands.  MacDougal raises back.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Will you stop being stubborn
                     for one sec...

     And stops.  Because he has turned.  With the eyes of a lion.  Being
     pulled from an antelope carcass.

                               MAC (quietly, subtitled Japanese)
                     I have a question.

     Rich Scottish voice.  Impeccable Japanese intonation.

                               GIN (brightly, subtitled Japanese)
                     Who the fuck am I?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     That is of no interest.

     Oh.  In spite of herself, she looks a little hurt.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     What, then?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Why.  Are we speaking.  Japanese?

     Her eyes move across his formidable face.

                              GIN
                     Uh.  I'm showing off.

     His eyes scan the length of her gown.  Her body.

                               MAC
                     Something of a habit?

     She is minus a comeback.

                               MAC
                     You know the alleged value of this
                     piece from some fucking computer,
                     which has no clue of the price I
                     can turn the scroll around for in
                     30 minutes.

     A beat.

                               GIN
                     No, you can't.

     He blinks.  No?

                               GIN (really sorry)
                     It's sold.

     His great head WHIPS around to see Madame Mao KISSING her pooch,
     flushed with victory.  He stares for a long moment, a veneer of
     philosophical almost masking his rage.  When he turns back...

                               MAC
                     Are you a confederate of my
                     adversaries?  Or are you just
                     stupid.

     And walks.  Away.

     HOLD on her.  Feeling like both.

     EXT. HOTEL OKURA - NIGHT

     Mac among the guests awaiting their cars, standing slightly apart.
     From behind him...

     ...a feminine throat clears.  Nervously.  He closes his eyes for a
     beat.  Then, turns.

                               GIN (softly)
                     How about.  If I try humility.

     And presents a business card to him with both hands, Japanese-
     style.  Mac looks in her eyes.  Takes the card with both hands.
     Reads...

                               MAC
                     Virginia Romay...

                               GIN
                     Gin, actually, Gin Romay.  I
                     was named after a card game.

                               MAC
                     Or a cheap cocktail.

     She blinks.  His brows raise...

                               MAC (softly)
                     As in.  I'll have a Gin Romay,
                     please.  With a twist.

     That laser, unsmiling stare.  Beyond sexy.  She gets lost in it for
     a beat.

                               GIN
                     You're supposed to be charming.

                               MAC
                     I'm supposed to be selective.

     Glances back to her card.  Reads...

                               MAC
                     Art and Antiquities Acquisition
                     Advisor, how alliterative...

     Looks up.  Still no smile.

                               MAC
                     And am I the antiquity?

                               GIN
                     In mint condition.

     She sighs.  Achingly lovely.

                               GIN
                     Look, I've studied you, I know...
                     pretty much...everything.

     Do you.

                               GIN
                     Made your first millions selling
                     scrap metal.  Then, gold mining
                     concessions, gems, art, and lately
                     strategic metals for new technologies
                     - platinum, zirconium, titanium...

                               MAC
                     You said.  Everything.

     Huh?  Oh.

                               GIN
                     The cat burglar stories?  Why
                     would anyone...with so much to
                     lose...take those kinds of risks?

     Guileless smile.

                               GIN
                     You'd have to be.  Stupid.

     A held beat.  His glance lifts beyond her shoulder.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me.

     And walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up.
     She goes after him.

                               GIN
                     I didn't know Porsche made
                     things like this.

                               MAC
                     Well, they don't...

     Tipping the valet.  Sliding in...

                               MAC
                     ...as a rule.

     Shutting the door.  Through the open window, she hands something
     from her bag.  A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer.
     She presses the light ON.  He looks at the slide.

                               GIN
                     Recognize that?

     No reaction.

                               GIN
                     My seller is in Shinjuku, we can
                     go there tonight.

     She leans closer.

                               GIN
                     He wants 4.6 million.  I can
                     get it for three.

     He hands it back.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     No, you can't.

     And TAKES OFF.  Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion...

     She's hailed a cab.

     INT. IMPERIAL HOTEL BAR - LATER

     Graceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the
     '20s.  Burnished.  Elegant.  Way cool.  A place to drink, to deal,
     to dream.  PAN down the polished surface of the bartop, til we
     come to...

     ...a tropical DRINK.  Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the
     room.  ROTATE ANGLE to see...

     ...INSIDE the umbrella, something small, something mechanical.  A
     woman's HAND ADJUSTS the point of the umbrella ever so slightly,
     and we PAN UP her arm to see...

     ...Gin.  Still in her gown.  She is reading, with half-glasses, and
     one of the bows curls around her ear, which we CLOSE on to hear...

     ...static.  Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional
     mike, and hears...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...only it's not bloody football!

     SNAP to Mac's table, well across the room.  Drinking giant beers
     with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled,
     suit.  The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if
     he actually gave a shit.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...it's just that crap Americans
                     call 'football', like you could
                     call your ass a butterscotch scone
                     and have it be one!

     The guy nods seriously.  Maybe he's a Sumo dude.

                               MAC
                     Why you'd want to bring that
                     foolishness to Japan, you're
                     just pissing your investment
                     down a bungee hole.

                               SUMO GUY (major accent)
                     You got Cubano this trip?

     That he does.  Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it
     over.  Flat against one side is an ENVELOPE, which Sumo Guy PALMS
     skillfully, slipping it seamlessly INTO his pocket as he withdraws
     a small MATCH BOX.  Takes out one long cigar, lights up...

                               MAC
                     Seriously, put the money into
                     pharmaceuticals or prostitution,
                     something stable.

     The big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac.
     Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small MICROCHIP fastened
     to the cardboard.  Lights up.  Slides the match box in his pocket.

                               MAC
                     Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial
                     plastics.

     ANGLE...Gin still engrossed in her reading.  A figure leans down
     next to her.  She startles, slightly.  So surprised to see...

                               MAC
                     My favorite thing in life.
                     Coincidence.

     She gives him the great smile.

                               GIN
                     I'm staying here, what's your
                     excuse?

     And now he smiles.  First time ever.  A little chilling, the way he
     does it.

                               MAC
                     Staying here, as well.  You
                     are in room...?

                               GIN (half a beat)
                     One thirty-eight.

     In one motion, he flags the bartender...

                               MAC
                     Will you send a half-bottle of
                     Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138,
                     please?  And some berries and
                     chocolates for the lady to enjoy
                     it with.

     He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back...

                               MAC
                     Actually, I was just across the
                     room, dickering with a gentleman
                     over the purchase of an interesting
                     Spitzweg.  Until I determined the
                     painting was apparently stolen...

     Oh.   She's shocked.  He agrees...

                               MAC
                     Goes against my grain.  The
                     DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6
                     million you can get for 3.  Can
                     you get it for 2 and a half?

     She looks in his eyes.

                               GIN
                     Sure.

     And as if he believed her...

                               MAC
                     My checkbook is in my safe.  You
                     wait here.

     His smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say...

                               GIN
                     Okay.  I'll wait here.

     INT. CAR, SHINJUKU DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Mac driving in silence.  Gin stealing glances at him.  Suddenly and
     smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up...

                               GIN
                     That's my purse.

     He opens it.  One eye on the road, he begins to rummage...

                               MAC
                     Just want to see if I'm with the
                     person you say you are.  Can't be
                     too caref...

     She SNATCHES the bag away from him, he GRABS it back, the car
     SWERVES LEFT, and...

     ...CRASHES VIOLENTLY into a parked pure white Bentley.  Metal
     BUCKLES and TEARS, both ALARMS go OFF, a cacophony of horrific
     NOISE.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Oh, dear.

     People come RUNNING, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly
     COUPLE who were just returning to their precious Bentley.  Their
     WAILS and ANGUISH would be suitable if all their grandchildren had
     been crushed beneath Mac's wheels.

     Mac and Gin are OUT of the car.  As he exits, Mac has palmed a
     small BLADE, and in a quick unseen motion, RIPPED a jagged tear
     in his left trouser leg.  The old couple RUSH to Mac, SHRIEKING
     their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as
     bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     We'll go in there, and call
                     the police.

     And HOBBLES off toward the nearest building, a block-square
     30-story skyscraper bearing the name FUJITSU.  The couple, the
     crowd, all race after the limping Mac...

                               GIN
                     Are you all right?

     No answer, he looks dark enough to rain.  INTO the public lobby of
     the huge industrial complex.  Two night GUARDS come hurrying from
     their desk, as the small mob POURS in.  Mac in the lead, a
     commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     I have damaged the car of these
                     kind people.  Please help them
                     call the police...

     One guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone.  Mac pulls up
     his trouser leg, and Gin GASPS to see a bloody GASH.  Mac drops the
     trouser back over the wound.  Asks the remaining guard...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I use a washroom, please.

     The guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos.  Mac hands his
     billfold to Gin...

                               MAC
                     These are my papers, passport, car
                     registration.  If the police arri...

                               GIN
                     You're going to need stitches,
                     let me get you to a hospital.

     Soft words, genuine concern.  And his eyes flicker.  As if somehow
     seeing her for the first time.  A small spark, but she feels it.
     Softer still...

                               GIN
                     Really, this can all wait.
                     I'll handle it.

     The look holds.

                               MAC
                     That's actually.  Very sweet.

     His first real smile.  It was worth waiting for.

                               MAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese)
                     Might you have a First Aid kit,
                     of some kind?

     INT. TOILET STALL

     We are inside an empty, closed, Japanese-style toilet stall.
     Porcelain foot rests.  A hole.  The door BURSTS OPEN, and...

     ...Mac enters FAST with the First Aid kit, locking the door,
     hitting the STOPWATCH on his wrist, which begins counting at
     ZERO.  He pulls UP his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash,
     and simply...

     ...RIPS the entire wound OFF, the rubbery prosthetic wound DANGLES,
     dripping its phony blood.  Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit,
     SOAKS them in bogus gore, expertly WRAPS his leg, then FLUSHES the
     prosthetic DOWN the hole.

     He pulls off the FUJITSU VISITOR badge clipped to his lapel, and
     from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he PRESSES
     to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge
     into...

     ...an EMPLOYEE I.D., the name KAWAKUBO, M., the PHOTO of a surly
     Japanese male.  Quickly, Mac takes out the MATCH BOX from the hotel
     bar, and with a fine tweezers gently removes the MICROCHIP, placing
     it INSIDE the badge, activating it with a soft BEEP-BEEP.  He
     reaches now...

     ...behind his back, up UNDER his tux jacket, and RIPS FREE a
     tightly-compressed PACK of what seems white paper or cloth.  He
     SNAPS it loose, revealing it to be...

     ...a baggy CLEAN SUIT, not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to
     the floor...

     ...a white HOOD.  With opaque tinted VISOR.

     INT. SECURITY CORRIDOR

     Mac in his clean suit and opaque-visored hood at an elevator marked
     CLEARED PERSONNEL ONLY in English and Kanji (Japanese characters).
     He holds his badge to the SCANNER, the door PINGS and slides OPEN..

     INT. PREP ROOM ENTRANCE, 29TH FLOOR

     Mac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an AIR-LOCK with
     sign CLEAN ROOM - CLASS 10.  Holds his badge to the SCANNER, the
     air-lock door lights FLASH froin red to yellow to green.  He
     enters...

     ...the PREP ROOM.  Recorded VOICES purr safety instructions in
     Japanese, while Mac stands, being bombarded by air shower, chemical
     sprayer, blinding UV light.  The next air-lock OPENS.  He enters...

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     ...a long ASSEMBLY LINE, where ROBOT ARMS work on a stream of black
     SILICON WAFERS, which pass along a clear Lexan CONVEYOR BELT.  The
     wafers move through various airtight CHAMBERS, exposing them to
     multi-colored gasses, cyan, sodium yellow, magenta, etc., as part
     of the microchip manufacturing process.

     More than a dozen TECHNICIANS in their hooded clean suits watch
     over every phase of the work, attached to the walls by grounding
     wires and air hoses, which create a deafening NOISE.  Mac simply
     hooks himself up, and saunters straight THROUGH the area, toward
     the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed
     MICROCHIPS...

     ...DISAPPEARS through the wall.  Nearby, a HATCH is built into the
     same wall, and Mac calmly CLANKS it OPEN, squeezing through into...

     ...a dimly-lit MAINTENANCE BAY.  Panels of switches, wires, fuses,
     fans, air cleaners.  Maximum claustrophobia, as Mac CLANGS the
     hatch SHUT behind him, looking instantly to...

     ...an OVERHEAD HATCH with letters in Kanji and English, DANGER
     ARGON GAS.  Mac THROWS back his hood, YANKS out his mini oxygen
     pouch, fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils,
     and slips on thick round infrared GOGGLES that make him look like a
     refugee from 12 MONKEYS.  No time to lose...

     ...up THROUGH the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he
     enters...

     ...the conveyer TUBE, a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in
     diameter, filled with billowing red gas.  Mac stretches out on his
     belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its
     precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in
     eerie red light.  He begins to...

     ...shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube.  Gas too
     thick to see the end.  He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when
     suddenly...

     ...the floor beneath his tube FALLS AWAY, and he is crawling in
     space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance
     between manufacturing and shipping structures.  He goes faster,
     HARDER...

     INT. MICROCHIP VAULT

     A black chamber.  We can scarcely make out the endless rows of
     shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering
     through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip
     in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves.  Through the gasket...

     ...Mac TUMBLES into view, swinging himself neatly DOWN to the
     floor, and in a single motion, he is already FLASHING a neon-green
     pen light along the shelves of microchips.  We see now the wrappers
     are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is
     definitely looking for something special, until...

     ...he's found it.  A single row, 35 chips, nothing special from
     here, but Mac...

     ...WHIPS out something coiled, SNAPS it to full length, revealing a
     strip of shiny black SATIN CLOTH.  Three feet long, little more
     than an inch wide.  Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly
     OVER the row of microchips.  And when he lifts it UP again...

     ...the chips have ADHERED to the underside of the cloth.  In one
     deft SNAP of his wrist, he COILS the cloth again, like a yo-yo.
     Turns to leave, and...

     Oh, yeh.

     Tosses a small SACK of something where the chips used to be.  TIM'S
     CASCADE BRAND POTATO CHIPS.  SEA SALT AND VINEGAR FLAVOR.

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     Mac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the Clean Room.
     No one sees, no one cares.  Hooking up once again, he ambles toward
     a door clearly marked EXIT ONLY TO EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - RETURN ONLY
     THROUGH SECURITY AREA.

     By the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall.  He pretends
     to scan it.  A stack of flyers.  He takes one.  Exiting into...

     INT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

     Past a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting.  Mac
     just strolling along, reading his flyer, as...

     A hand.  Touches his shoulder

                               VOICE (subtitled Japanese)
                     Excuse me.

     Mac turns, stares through his opaque VISOR at a well-built SECURITY
     OFFICER.  Dead straight eyes.

                               OFFICER (subtitled Japanese)
                     The company picnic.  Saturday or
                     Sunday?

     His eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'.  Mac hands it to him,
     and without a trace of Scottish accent...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Better eat first.

     INT. GUEST LOBBY

     Gin is up to her ears in grief.  There are no less than five COPS
     grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second
     wind and are SHRIEKING in top form.  The bystander gallery has
     grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in.
     As Gin struggles to cope...

     ...she keeps looking at the clock.  Darting glances toward the
     corridor.  She is freaking out.

     Finally.  She can't stand it.  Hands Mac's billfold to one of the
     cops, pushes her way through the mob, and...

     ...TAKES OFF down the corridor, a security guard in belated
     pursuit, we go...

     ...WITH her DOWN the hallway, WHEEL around a corner, flat-out
     SPRINTING, SKIDS to a stop at the right doorway and BURSTS INTO...

     INT. MEN'S ROOM

     An empty washroom.  She listens.  Nothing.

                               GIN
                     Mr. MacDougal?  Sir?

     No sound.  Uh-oh.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Mr. Ma...

                               MAC (O.S., from the stall)
                     Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became
                     of a gentleman's privacy?

     The security guard BARGES IN.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     My God, more females?

     The guard starts railing at Gin a mile a minute.  She calmly takes
     a WAD of bills from her purse.  Hands them to the guy...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Stand outside.  That door.  Two
                     minutes...

     He does.  Alone again.

                               GIN
                     I was worried, it's been twenty...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Eighteen, actually.  The leg is
                     fine, but I got sort of...woozy.

                               GIN
                     Woozy.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Lost my stomach once or twice.

     CUT INSIDE the stall.  He is just re-taping the folded clean suit
     and hood to the small of his back.

                               MAC
                     I'm an old man.  You probably
                     noticed.

     Awkward silence.  He smiles at that, much amused.  Slips on his
     jacket.

                               MAC
                     You should see me without
                     my teeth.

     UNLOCKS the door.  Remembers...

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up.

     That's not what he forgot.  He pulls OUT the coiled black satin
     cloth strip, SNAPS it free, microchips snug to the underside.  And
     fits it neatly...

     ...DOWN his trouser leg.  The perfect tuxedo stripe.

     OUT the door.  To meet her gaze.

                               MAC
                     Odd place, this.

     He goes to her.  Offers his arm.

                               MAC
                     What do you suppose they make
                     here?  Video recorders?

     She takes it, wrapping both hers through.

                               GIN
                     Microchips, I think, for computers.

     He opens the door.  Ushers her through...

                               MAC
                     Bad investment.  The best ones
                     are here today...

     Follows her out...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Gone tomor...

     Closed door.  Quiet.

     INT. CAB, NIHONBASHI DISTRICT - NIGHT

     They sit together in the rear of the taxi, as it makes its way
     through late night traffic.  She is looking around.

                               GIN
                     This isn't the way to my sel...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I've changed my mind.

     Looking straight ahead.  Contemplative.  She stares at his
     profile...

                               GIN
                     Mind telling me why?

                               MAC
                     You can't get it for me at 2.5,
                     can you?

                               GIN
                     Well, we can tr...

                               MAC
                     You were setting me up.  The correct
                     price is 2.8.  You conspire with the
                     seller to start at 4.6, so I'll be
                     grateful when you 'bargain' him down
                     to three.  Close enough to fool some
                     people.  unfortunately...

     He sighs.  Never looks at her.

                               MAC
                     I'm old.  I know what everything
                     is worth.

     She keeps staring.

                               GIN
                     So where are we g...

                               MAC
                     I am going to the airport.  You
                     are going on to the rest of your
                     life.  Which...

     He thinks.  Admits...

                               MAC
                     ...should be interesting.

     Her turn to think.

                               GIN
                     You forgot your lugg...

                               MAC
                     The hotels deal with that.  The
                     things I need are always waiting
                     at the next one.
                               (afterthought)
                     I don't carry.  Baggage.

     Little twist on that.

                               GIN
                     Sensible.  And you're off to...?

                               MAC
                     Oh, that's highly personal.

     He still stares straight ahead.  The taxi pulls onto a freeway.
     Toward Narita Airport.  Time running out.  And in her dearest, most
     vulnerable, voice...

                               GIN
                     I did so hope to impress you.

     She puts the fingertips of her left hand.  On his chest.  A
     silence.  No reaction.

                               GIN (hopeful)
                     I'm still hoping...

     And he smiles.  Turns to her eyes.

                               MAC
                     Young lady.  I am old enough to
                     be your grandfather.

     She shakes her head.  Uh-uh.

                               GIN (soft)
                     My father.

     Leans her mouth in for the kill.

                               GIN (whisper)
                     That's part of the rush.

     And softly.  Fits her mouth to his.  The green eyes close, as
     she tastes him.  Nothing predatory in this kiss.  It is tender,
     exquisite.  A kiss of deep longing.  Of true love.

     His arms slip around her.  And in less than five seconds...

                               TAXI DRIVER (O.S., racist accent)
                     Still on fo' airport?

     Nobody.  Says.  Nothin'.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - LATE NIGHT

     A small bottle.  An ornate label.  Chateau d'Yquem '67.  Gin lifts
     it from the table, studies the label.  She wears only a man's
     oversized t-shirt.  Our rotating ANGLE reveals the empty bed,
     tangled sheets.  Gin looks pretty rumpled herself.

     She lifts the bottle, two glasses, a plateful of chocolates and
     strawberries, and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking...

     ...the TERRACE.  Mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing,
     overlooking downtown Tokyo.  He wears a thin Japanese robe called
     a yukata, and is wrapped in half of a huge down COVERLET from the
     bed.  The other half obviously waiting for...

                               GIN
                     Here.  A reward.

     She curls down into the billowing coverlet, just against his body.
     Sets her things beside him.

                               MAC
                     A reward for what?

                               GIN
                     For not being old.  After all.

     It is a lovely smile.  He studies it for a beat.

                               MAC
                     You mean.  Not as old as I look.

     She traces her finger along his cheek.

                               GIN (a whisper)
                     Yeh.

     And kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With
     him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back...

     ...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the
     larger piece.

                               GIN
                     Do I deserve a reward?

     No answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great
     tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows.

                               GIN
                     It's so hard to find good casual
                     sex, anymore.  I'm probably out
                     of practice.

     But he just looks at her.

                               MAC
                     What's hard to find.  Is someone
                     you truly want to be with.

     And leans closer.  Just above a whisper...

                               MAC
                     Even for awhile.

     He kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And
     when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for
     something to say.

                               GIN
                     It's lucky we stopped by my room,
                     for the wine.

     She swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not
     forgetting that she's changed the subject.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise, we'd never have found
                     my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow.

                               MAC
                     Would that make it more stolen?

     She smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe
     she's wondering if she actually likes him.

                               GIN
                     They even got my prescriptions.

                               MAC
                     Something you need? There are
                     all-night chemists...

     He does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose.

                               GIN
                     I take Prilosec.  For stomach
                     acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma.

     She gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease.

                               GIN
                     But since I didn't have to work
                     all that hard tonight...

     He stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her
     eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Ouch.  I had that coming.

     She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He
     wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close.

                               GIN
                     Why would someone steal my luggage?
                     Every guest in this place must
                     have more than a wannabe art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you
                     had something valuable in there.

     Something in the tone.

                               GIN
                     Such as...

                               MAC
                     Well.  Wannabe dealers make
                     excellent fences.

     A flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the
     humor.

                               GIN
                     He thought I had a stolen
                     painting.  In my bag.

                               MAC
                     I'm joking, of course.

     Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC
                     The Vermeer wouldn't fit.

     Her eyes widen.  Just a little.

                               GIN
                     Excuse me?

                               MAC
                     Why, did you do something wrong?

     She turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each
     reading the other's eyes.

                               GIN
                     You said.  Vermeer.

                               MAC
                     The most famous painting stolen
                     this week.

     His turn.  To kiss her nose.

                               MAC
                     If you don't keep up on your
                     craft.  You'll miss all the jokes.

     And lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he
     winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but...

     ...he fills it with his own.

     This conversation.  Is over.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING

     VIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe
     they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a
     distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see...

     Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly
     going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every
     goddam thing in the room.  She comes to...

     ...Mac's tux.  The jacket, rifles the pockets, pats the lining.
     The pants now...

     ...something peculiar. The right leg has no stripe. Touches the
     cloth.  Slightly sticky where the stripe should be.  Odd.

     ANGLE...the bathroom.  Shower running full BLAST.  But there's no
     one in it.

     ANGLE...a storage closet.  Mac crouching in the smallspace.  We
     see the travel bag.  The luggage tag, VIRGINIA ROMAY, a Darien,
     Connecticut address.  The embossed initials VR.  But there is
     something else in Mac's hand...

     ...a prescription bottle.  Prilosec.  And a name, GINGER BAKER.
     Chicago address.  Mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe...

     ...exits the closet.  Locks the door.

     ANGLE...Mac ambling into the bedroom, toweling his hair with one
     hand.  Holding his billfold in the other.  Gin is starting a room
     service breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, Belgian waffles.  The girl can
     eat.

                               MAC
                     I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo.

     She looks up.  Trademark dry grin...

                               GIN
                     I love a guy who knows how to
                     sweet talk.

     He stands over her.  Smiling.  What he meant was...

                               MAC
                     There was a call.  While you
                     were sleeping.

     A call.

                               MAC
                     An art dealer I know.  He has a
                     Monet.  Minor, but it is Giverny.
                     He'll let me have it for 5.3 million.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN (cautiously)
                     We can maybe beat that.

                               MAC (pulling plastic from his billfold)
                     I agree.  This is a bank debit card.
                     It gives the bearer access to an
                     account containing 4.6 and change.
                     I dislike round numbers.

     And hand. the card to her.  As her eyes move over it...

                               MAC
                     I'd like you to go down there,
                     and pick up the painting.  If
                     that's all right.

     Without looking up...

                               GIN
                     Me.

                               MAC
                     If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You
                     just hand him the debit card, with
                     that...luminous smile.  And say,
                     take it or leave it.

     Now her eyes come up.  She says nothing.  Hesitant.

                               MAC
                     Oh, dear.  I thought you so
                     wanted to make a good impression.

                               GIN
                     Thought I already did th...

                               MAC
                     And along with making an excellent
                     impression.  You will also make 2
                     percent of the purchase price.

     She blinks.

                               MAC
                     That's $92,000.  And change..
                     For two hours work.

     The look holds.  He goes to the desk.  Lifts a cellular phone.
     TOSSES it to her.

                               MAC
                     Any problems.  Just give me
                     a ring.

                               GIN
                     Stolen painting is it?

                               MAC
                     Of course not.

     And on his way out the door...

                               MAC
                     If it was.  I wouldn't pay more
                     than three.

     EXT. WHARF, YOKOHAMA - DAY

     Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund.
     Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle
     counters, all built along a tall rickety PIER nearly thirty feet
     above the pounding surf.  The harbor is gigantic.  Every type and
     size of vessel imaginable.

     Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and
     a lightweight bright orange foam cover.  She looks at her slip of
     paper.  Then across at the place...KENDO SOUVENIRS, a schlock
     kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front.

     This can't be right.  Pulls out the cellular phone.  Dials.

                               MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.)
                     You have reached the voice-mail
                     of AMD Investments.  And, yes,
                     you are at the right place.

     Fucking great.

                               GIN (into phone, pissed)
                     I like men with a sense of humor.
                     This does not qualify.

     SNAPS the phone shut.  Checks the slip again.  Walks firmly across
     the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into...

     INT. KENDO SOUVENIRS - DAY

     The place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist
     crap imaginable.  The only paintings on display are renderings of
     big cats on black velvet.  She winds her way through, to a counter
     at the back.  One guy there...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I please speak with Mr. Okati.

                               OKATI
                     You doin' it.

     The best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the Hawaiian
     shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to
     be the guy who is selling you a Monet.  Even a minor one.

                               GIN
                     I think there's some mista...

                              OKATI
                     You from Mac?

     She stops.  Jesus.  The guy COUGHS horribly.

                               GIN
                     I'm from Mac.

                               OKATI
                     Lemme see card.

     She hesitates.

                               OKATI
                     Four million, six hundred
                     thirteen thousand, five hundred?

     Wow.  He slaps his hand on the table.  Lay it down, toots.

                               GIN
                     You first.

     He shrugs.  Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter...

     ...a brown paper-wrapped rectangle.  Not much larger than two feet
     square.  She can't even believe she's here, doing this.  Gestures
     to him.  Open it up!

     He obliges, COUGHING grossly all the while.  Unwrapped, the
     painting does look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it.

                               GIN
                     Now bring me the real one.

     He doesn't blink.

                               OKATI
                     This as real as it gets, lady.

     And from within her pocket.  The cellular RINGS.  She takes it
     out.  Puts it to her ear.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You got it?

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Is this an audition, a joke, or
                     a rip-off?  I'm staring at an
                     obvious forgery, here.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Turn it over.

     This gives her pause.  Then, cradling the phone against her
     shoulder, she does as she's told.  To see...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Is there an envelope?  Taped to
                     the back?  In a Ziploc bag?

     Sure is.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Uh-huh.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Detach the bag.  Read what's
                     in it.  Aloud.

     She does.  Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps...

                               GIN (reading into phone)
                     Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it
                     says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates,
                     statistics...specs on some kind of
                     machine, diag...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Papers back in the envelope,
                     envelope back in the Ziploc, very
                     quickly, without seeming to hurry...

     Her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told,
     cradling the phone with her shoulder.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Now take the debit card from your
                     purse, slipping the Ziploc into the
                     purse as you do it, shielding the move
                     from everyone in the room but Okati.

     And she does.  More deftly than we could ever have imagined.  Like
     a pro.

                               MAC (O.S., quietly)
                     Give him the card.

     A beat.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Mac, the painting's a forg...

                               MAC (O.S., even quieter)
                     This is a test.  Of whether you'll
                     still be alive four minutes from
                     now.  Do you hear me?

     Her face freezes.  In a pleasant smile.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Yes, Mac, I do.

                               MAC (0.5.)
                     Now.  Hand him the card, and tell
                     him in Japanese to pretend he is
                     checking it by phone.  Tell him to
                     take awhile, as if he's on hold.

     She turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati.  Hands him the card...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Mac says, pretend you're checking
                     this by phone, and take your ti...

                               OKATI (subtitled Japanese)
                     ...like I'm on hold, sure.

     And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some
     schmuck in baggy pants.  He takes the card, stares at it comically,
     picks up the phone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     While he's checking, look around
                     the room casually, as if searching
                     for the cheesy handbags...

     She begins to.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     All the while laughing, as if you
                     are chatting with someone you
                     actually like.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     I'm not that good.

     But she is.  And she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy
     handbags.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     As you're looking around, do you
                     notice any m...

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Three guys, two together, one
                     alone.  Cheap suits, not looking
                     at me in a cop-casual way.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Call out cheerily to Okati, in
                     English, 'Where's the toilet?'

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Can I say, 'little girl's room'?

     A beat.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Wing it.

                               GIN (calls out, cheerily)
                     WHERE'S THE CRAPPER?

     Okati, absorbed by his make-believe phone call, points around the
     back.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Get going.  Now.

                               GIN (into phone, as she saunters)
                     Mac, the painting isn't...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You've got what we bought, are
                     you out of their sight?

     She turns the corner.  Filthy corridor.  Restrooms at opposite
     ends.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Run into the men's toilet.
                     I know you know how.

     A beat of uncertainty.  She looks both ways.

                               MAC (O.S., ominous)
                     Are you running?

     And she DOES.  SPRINTING down the garbage-strewn hallway, throws
     OPEN the men's room door, BURSTING IN on...

     ...a wispy OLD GUY taking a leak through a HOLE in the floor.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

     The panicked little man STARTLES.  Bolts OUT the door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Jump.

     Jump?  HEAR now, from the corridor, footfalls POUNDING.  She looks
     down through the piss hole.  The surf ROILS thirty feet below.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     It's too small.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     The window, twit!

     Oh.  She hops OVER the disgusting hole, boosts herself UP to the
     small window, footfalls racing CLOSER, HOISTS herself HALFWAY
     through, DROPPING the phone a scary 30 feet to the surf below, as
     behind her, the door...

     ...SLAMS OPEN and she FLIES OUT the window...

                               GIN
                     SHIIIIIIIIIIT...

     WITH her in SLO-MO, kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder
     bag, and she...

     HITS the ocean like a ton of bricks.  Disappears.  Comes up,
     sputtering in the swirling water, as from out of the shadows of
     the pilings...

     ...an engine ROARS to life, the BLUR of a custom JETSKI, Mac
     reaching to scoop the startled girl OUT of the water, and they...

     ...BLAST OFF, as bullets RAIN helplessly after them.  The AGENTS
     shouting into their cellulars, racing in frustration down the pier,
     which rapidly vanishes behind us, as...

     ...Gin hangs onto Mac for dear life.  This baby is REALLY hauling.
     He wears an orange waterproof slicker with matching trousers.
     Shouts back, against the noise...

                               MAC
                     ARE YOU PISSED OFF?

     She thinks.  Admits, shouting in his ear...

                               GIN
                     ACTUALLY.  IT'S INCREDIBLY COOL!

     He is heading into deep water, a major shipping channel, points to
     one side, and she sees...

     ...a huge HARBOR PATROL vessel FIRE UP in near distance.  The chase
     is ON.  They speed toward the WAKE of a luxury liner, and as she
     realizes...

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOO...

     They SLAM INTO the wake HEAD ON, and are AIRBORNE for an amazing
     distance, JOLTING back to the surface, RACING toward...

     ...two gigantic FREIGHTERS which approach each other from opposite
     directions.  The Harbor Patrol in hot pursuit, BLASTING its HORN...

                               GIN
                     WE'RE GONNA DIE, AREN'T WE?

                               MAC
                     JUST AS SOON AS I'M READY!

     As we near the outbound freighter, Mac CUTS his speed.  Now the
     Harbor Patrol is really gaining.

                               GIN
                     FASTER, NOT SLOWER, YOU TWIT!!

                               MAC
                     HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SPORTING
                     CHANCE...

     Cruising STRAIGHT TOWARD the part side of the outbound freighter,
     as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side...

                               MAC
                     ...SOMETHING WE SCOTS LEARNED
                     FROM THE BRITS!

     As the Harbor Patrol is nearly ON them, Mac VEERS suddenly AROUND
     the stern of the outbound freighter, the Harbor patrol WHEELING
     madly to pursue, only to find we are both CAREENING straight AT...

     ...the starboard side of the inbound freighter, Mac CUTS his wheel
     in an adroit nearly right-angle SWERVE, and hears the SCREAMS as
     the Harbor patrol...

     PLOWS INTO the freighter!  Wasting no time, he ACCELERATES into
     maximum BURN, STREAKING toward the immensely crowded harbor and its
     thousand vessels.  Gin can't help but look back at the impressive
     crash site, mouthing a silent WOW.

     Nearing the harbor, Mac CUTS speed completely, drifting between two
     huge ships and...

     ...vanishing from sight.

     EXT. SMALL CHANNEL - DAY

     The tiny Jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of
     all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all
     larger than we are.  Gin clings close to Mac, although it is no
     necessary.  More like romantic.  She is still flushed with
     the rush.

                               GIN
                     I guess you're gonna explain
                     all this, huh?

     But he says nothing.  Pulls out a water-tight duffle.  Hands it
     back to her, without looking.

                               MAC
                     Dry clothes, you'll need them.
                     In five minutes.

     She takes the bag, confused.

                               GIN
                     I'm supposed to change?  Here??

                               MAC
                     I won't look.  Gentleman's word
                     of hon...

                               GIN
                     There are a million sailors!

                               MAC
                     I've seen you naked.  Give the
                     boys a thrill.

     He means it.

                               MAC
                     You probably won't be dating
                     any of them, so what the hell.

     Gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft.  No
     one seems to be paying much attention.  What the hell.  She unzips
     the bag, pulling out...

                               GIN (astonished)
                     These...these are mine!

     He never looks around.

                               MAC
                     Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps
                     the thief wasn't your size.

     She stares at the back of his head.  wondering.  He is stripping
     off his slickers.  A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath.

                               MAC
                     We have a business appointment.
                     In four minutes.

     Okay.  She pulls her dress off OVER her head.

                               GIN
                     Business, huh?

     She ignores some nearby WHISTLES and SHOUTS.  Begins drying herself
     with a fluffy towel from the bag.

                               MAC (never turns)
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     Uh-oh.  Paydirt.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Am I gonna like th...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I'm a thief.

     She can scarcely believe he's admitting this.

                               MAC
                     And now that I've told you.
                     I'll have to kill you.

     He chuckles a Scottish chuckle.  Cold and warm, at once.

                               MAC
                     Or...

     She slips the dry dress OVER her head.

                               MAC
                     ...you can spend the most
                     interesting three weeks of
                     your life.  Training.

                               GIN
                     Training for wha...

                               MAC
                     ...followed by the most exciting
                     night of your life.  After which,
                     you can walk away with 20 million
                     untraceable dollars...

     She blinks.  He means this.

                               MAC
                     ...which will come in handy.
                     Things being what they are.

     He shrugs.

                               MAC
                     From now on.  You can valet park.

     She begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress.  We
     suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty.

                               GIN
                     And if I refuse?

                               MAC (very quietly)
                     Don't.  Please.

                               GIN
                     I mean, you won't really kill
                     me, I'm far too adorable.

     He looks around at her.  As if deciding on that.

                               MAC
                     Last night, at Fujitsu, I did
                     some business.  While you thought
                     I was in the toilet.

     Jesus.

                               GIN
                     What could you possibly steal
                     in 18 min...

                               MAC
                     Thirty-five super-microchips.
                     Each worth one million dollars.
                     And change.

     Staring dead at her eyes.

                               GIN
                     You hate round num...

                               MAC
                     I stole your suitcase when I
                     left you at the bar.  I have
                     since sent it on to the States,
                     with three chips, well hidden.

     Are you following?

                               MAC
                     Since you aren't there to claim
                     it, the bag will sit at Customs.
                     Safe.  Unless...

     No smile.  No smile at all.

                               MAC
                     They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip.

     Holy.  Fucking.  Christ.

                               GIN
                     That's entrapment.

                               MAC
                     No, entrapment is what cops do
                     to robbers.

     We can feel her heart pounding from here.

                               MAC
                     Blackmail.  Is what robbers
                     do to schmucks.

     And leans.  To kiss her mouth.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Even adorable ones.

     They have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic FREIGHTER.  It
     is at water level, the steps they use for their tender.  He points
     up to the name...

                               MAC
                     Pop quiz.

     SHIKOKU MARU.  She nods, slowly.  Pulls the Ziploc bag from her
     purse.  Hands it over.  He removes the sheets of paper.  Begins to
     peruse them...

                               MAC
                     Admit it's a rush.  The best day
                     of your heretofore drab life.

                               GIN
                     Fuck you.

     He glances up.

                               GIN
                     ...accompanied by related foreplay.

     And gives him the smile. What a gal.

     He offers his hand.  She rises, hops lightly to the steps of the
     gangway in her bare feet.  He pulls dry shoes from the duffle.  And
     as she slips them on...

     ...he FLIPS a switch, and the Jetski begins to FILL with water, Mac
     stepping to the gangway beside her.  They watch...

     ...the Jetski rapidly SINK out of sight.

     No evidence.  A thorough guy.

     INT. FREIGHTER HOLD - DAY

     Mac and Gin stand inside a gigantic CARGO BAY, watching massive
     CONTAINERS being loaded by crane from a dock, through the gaping
     HATCH.  The chamber is a vaulted cathedral of steel, painted
     hospital green, and Mac's eye moves over all of it, seeming to
     inspect every plate, every pan head rivet.

                               VOICE (O.S., British cheer)
                     Hullo, there!

     They turn to see a round little man with watering eyes and a very
     wide necktie, skipping-down the iron steps.  Bursting with a
     salesman's bonhomie, he extends a plump hand...

                               MAN
                     Nickerson Carlsby, Mr...
                     MacDuff, yes?

                               MAC
                     Banquo MacDuff.  This is my
                     associate-fiancee, Ms. Duncan.

     The little man pauses.  A tic in the well-oiled smile...

                               CARLSBY
                     That is...fiancee and assoc...

                               GIN (cheery herself)
                     I'm a hyphenate.

     Ah.  Like that makes complete sense.  Fingers the gardenia in his
     lapel...

                               CARLSBY
                     Well, it's a pleasure, in this
                     alien place, to do business with
                     a countryman.

                               MAC
                     I'm a Scot.  It's a different
                     country.  Culturally and historically.

     I see.

                               CARLSBY (looking around)
                     Well.  They've brought you to
                     quite the wrong place, I see.

                               MAC (looking around)
                     Thank God.

     ANGLE...Carlsby leads the way along a narrow catwalk, which ends at
     a steel door.  He presses his thumb to the I.D. panel, and speaks
     into the voice box...

                               CARLSBY (confidential code-voice)
                     In Penny Lane, the barber shaves
                     another customer...

     The door CLANGS open.  They go through it, as a gangway leads
     toward an open five-foot-thick VAULT DOOR, where two ARMED GUARDS
     rise from their seats.  Carlsby ignores them as if they were
     furniture.  THUMPS the door...

                               CARLSBY
                     Five feet thick with hidden rein-
                     forcements, no way to drill through!

                               GIN (authoritative)
                     Impressive.

                               CARLSBY
                     Only the tip of our security
                     iceberg.  See these two Brinks
                     locks...?

     They do.

                               CARLSBY
                     The Captain keeps one key.  The
                     other is continually forwarded:
                     to the Chief of Security at next
                     port.  There is no way to enter
                     during voyage.

                               GIN
                     I like this.

     Carisby glances to Mac.  He is stone.

                               CARLSBY
                     The best armed guard, rotated every
                     six hours.  A redundancy, of course,
                     but we would rather be safe three
                     times over than merely two.

                               GIN
                     Sound mathematics.

                               MAC (very quiet)
                     What if there's a fire?  In the
                     chamber.

     Ah.  Carlsby leads them through the open door, into...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  Primo.  The steel coated with sleek,
     matte, black all-grip paint.  Tubby points up...

                               CARLSBY
                     Sprinklers.  New design.  Incredible
                     power.  The entire chamber is water-
                     proof, fireproof, airtight.  If the
                     ship sinks, God forfend, your cargo
                     is secure for salvage.

     No reaction.  Mac does not look convinced.

                               CARLSBY
                     And your cargo is...?

                               MAC
                     Wine.

     Wine.

                               MAC
                     The bloody Japs bought up half
                     the premium clarets in the universe.
                     You may have heard.

     Actually.  He has.

                               MAC
                     I'm in charge of shipping some
                     14,000 bottles, most quite rare,
                     to a number of premium hotels in
                     Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore,
                     Phuket, and Penang.

     Carlsby gets the romance of it all.

                               MAC
                     All of which are destinations on
                     your October voyage.  Five months
                     from now.  However...

     And turns to the man.  With laser, disapproving eyes.

                               MAC
                     Wine.  Doesn't prefer.  To be
                     jostled.

     The man beams.  Gestures to a series of PLATFORMS, each SWAYING at
     different heights, in different directions.

                               CARLSBY
                     Our 'delicate treasure' platforms,
                     suspended on gimbals.  Your cargo
                     remains unruffled by roiling seas.
                     Then, on arrival, is plucked...

     Pointing once more...

                               CARLSBY
                     By that forklift, and gently
                     deposited on dock through the
                     cargo hatch...

     ...a huge circular hatch cut into the hull.  Mac's eyes stare
     blankly at it.  A long beat.  He pronounces it all...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

     And then turns once more.

                               MAC
                     Did we see...a bathing pool.
                     On deck?

                               CARLSBY
                     Oh, yes, sir.  The Shikoku Maru
                     carries sixteen luxury suite pas-
                     senger cabins.  The finest cuisine.
                     For valued clients who prefer to
                     cruise in privacy.

     Mac.  Thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     Mildly.  Interesting.

     INT. PASSENGER DECK - DAY

     Carlsby ushering the couple along a plushly-appointed hallway.  A
     secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter.
     He opens a burnished door, into...

     ...an elegant SUITE.  Cherrywood panels, spacious windows with
     views of the harbor.  The finest furnishings.  It is breathtaking.
     Even...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

                               GIN
                     But dearest, in five months,
                     we'll be in Cape Town.

     Mac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been
     taped to the back of Okati's Monet.  Peruses them casually.

                               MAC
                     Anything sooner?  That goes
                     perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka?
                     To Jakarta.

     And looks up.  To a man dumbstruck.  By coincidence.

                               CARLSBY
                     Why, yes.  In three weeks.

     INT. CESSNA - DAY

     Looking DOWN on California's San Joaquin Valley from 12,000 feet,
     as air RUSHES past our open door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You seem depressed.

     PULL BACK to see them both in jumping suits.  He's checking her
     gear.  She's eyeing the expansive grid of fields below.

                               GIN
                     At your insistence, I'm leaping
                     to my death, and I don't know why!

     He clips a tether from his harness to hers.

                               MAC
                     Because.  You're a greedy girl.

                               GIN
                     I'm not jumping until you talk
                     about this, it's been two days!

     She folds her arms across her chest.  Rebellious.  He smiles at her
     tenderly.  Nods, okay.

                               GIN
                     Why are we going in three weeks,
                     if the wine is on a different
                     route months lat...

                               MAC
                     There is no wine.  That just bought
                     us a look at their security.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     I knew that.

                               MAC
                     What we want is on the boat in
                     three weeks.  Now can we jump?

                               GIN
                     The machine in those diagrams.  on
                     the back of the painting.

     Maybe.  He's still smiling.

                               GIN
                     What does it do, make gold?

                               MAC
                     We're nearing the targ...

                               GIN
                     Why won't you trust me?

                               MAC
                     How do I know who you are, hmmn?

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     For all I know, your name isn't
                     Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're
                     a cop.

     She stares back.  Dead straight.

                               GIN
                     Why would a cop do all th...

                               MAC (softly)
                     Entrapment, remember? What cops
                     do to robbers.

                               GIN (just as softly)
                     Oh.  That.

     His smile is light, affectionate.  Gently, he backs her to the edge
     of the doorway...

                               MAC
                     One...two...

     She THROWS her arms around his neck.  Holds him close.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm afraid.

     Vulnerable and touchingly real.  His arms slide around her.

                               GIN
                     Of you.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Smart girl.

     And JUMPS, Gin SHRIEKING in his arms, as we...

     FOLLOW them, TUMBLING in FREE FALL, until he releases her, and bot
     EXTEND their arms and legs, as if flying, as if gliding face down,
     her shriek CONTINUING.  He floats at the end of their tether, a few
     feet above her.  And at last...

     ...her SCREAMING STOPS.  We see the pure adrenaline rush.  Shouts
     back...

                               GIN
                     NEXT TIME, I'M ON TOP!

     EXT. HILLTOP, MARIN COUNTY - DAY

     Woods, rolling hills, a dirt path.  Mac stands by a sign at a
     crossroads, names, arrows, STINSON BEACH, BOLINAS, MT. TAMALPAIS,
     MILL VALLEY.  There is a phone booth nearby.  He holds a stopwatch,
     looking down the path, as...

     ...Gin runs into view, steady stride, breathing hard, sheened with
     sweat.  Approaching him, she slows to a stop.  Hands on her knees,
     catching her wind. He CLICKS the watch.

                               MAC
                     Consistent.  And rather impressive.

     She sends a nasty smile, thanks a bunch.  But maybe she likes the
     compliment, after all.

     EXT. MAC'S CABIN, BOLINAS - NIGHT

     Rustic cabin in moonlight.  Ringed by woods.  Middle of nowhere,
     which is where Mac likes it.  As we approach the lit window, we
     hear two oddly-matched sounds.  splashing water.  And the HISS of a
     violent POWER TOOL.  We MOVE THROUGH the window, into...

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Two figures stand in the shower, spray SOAKING their shorts and
     tank tops.  Gin is operating a sleek WELDER, trying to perform
     micro-surgery on a DARTBOARD which Mac waves in all directions at
     the end of a short pole.

                               MAC
                     All right, six and seven...

     She blinks the spray from her eyes, and deftly SEARS the wire
     dividing those two numbers on the board.  As Mac keeps waving it,
     she goes off line.  Concentrates.  Gets it right.  The wire PEELS
     away...

                               MAC
                     Three and four...

     EXT. CABIN - DAY

     CLOSE on Gin operating a small steamshovel with a loading
     attachment on the front.  It is mounted with two 2 x 4's, set
     close together, protruding from the loader.  She maneuvers the
     wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks.  But as she positions
     to scoop one up, her vehicle SWAYS WILDLY, and we PULL BACK to
     see it is...

     ...dangling from a CRANE, operated by Mac.  Gin stays with it,
     concentrates, and on the next pass she glides her boards UNDER a
     huge rock, LIFTING it awkwardly.  Ignoring the bumpy ride, she
     pivots, and deposits her prize in place atop what has become...

     ...a WALL of stones.

                               GIN
                     What the hell are we building?

     He gives this some reflection.

                               MAC
                     A chalet, I think.  Or an outhouse.

     EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

     Mac and Gin paddle KAYAKS, side by side.  A full moon slams off
     the rolling surface of the sea.  Light chop, enough to bob pretty
     strong once they stop paddling.  His stopwatch GLOWS.  He says
     only...

                               MAC
                     Forty seconds.

     And she FLIPS OVER, submerging her head and torso, and we go...
     ...WITH her underwater, upside-down in the kayak, she STRUGGLES to
     FREE a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit.  Fumbling
     to BREAK the seal on a slender TUBE, which BURSTS, sending a GLOW
     of yellow-green LIGHT in all directions.  She fits the flexible
     tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out...

     ...a small ELECTRIC FAN with side HANDGRIPS of black metal.
     Buffeted by the current, Gin manages to flip a small switch on the
     housing of the fan, and...

     ...nothing happens.  Again.  Nothing.  And again.  SHIT!  With a
     supreme effort, she tries to ROLL herself upright, but...

     ...can't quite make it.  Blind PANIC now, blowing bubbles, FLAILING
     at the kayak, which suddenly...

     ROLLS upright, manipulated by Mac.  She sputters and tries to
     THROW the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and SLAMS her
     across the shoulder.  She is furious.

                               GIN
                     Get your fucking equipment
                     together, man, this is a
                     professional operation!!

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Gin in a clearing, arms at her sides, a determined look.  Mac is
     somewhere just behind us.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     This time, when you raise your
                     arm.  Don't breathe.

     She nods, got it.  Focused.  suddenly, in the clearing before her,
     a HOSTAGE SILHOUETTE TARGET pops up, the outline of a terrorist
     shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a BLUR
     and...

     ...BLAMM, BLAMM, BLAMM!!!  The paper terrorist is NAILED in the
     head.  Two out of three.  She lets out a thin stream of air.  Proud
     of herself, but too cool to gloat.

                               MAC
                     Very, very nice.  Had a tour
                     with the Mosad, did you?

     She turns slowly.

                               GIN
                     Where does this fit in the
                     game plan?

     His enigmatic, yet fond, smile.

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  But one
                     never knows...

     A quiet wink.

                               MAC
                     You might need it with me.

     INT. CABIN - NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin leaning back at a 45 degree angle.  She is sweating.
     This is hard.  HEAR a SLAM-THWOCK!  And ANOTHER.  PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     She is climbing UP the inside of the angled A-frame CEILING, using
     hand rods with powerful SUCTION cups, and similar suction devices
     on the balls of her feet.  A human spider, inching up the wall with
     everything she's got.  She SLAMS the next hand rod down, and it...

     ...slips.

                               GIN
                     Shit.

     ...as she TUMBLES eighteen feet to...

     DISAPPEAR in an ocean of STYROFOAM packing bubbles, which EXPLODE
     in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator.

     She has totally VANISHED.  Buried alive.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     DID I SAY SHIT?

     Mac is wading into the sea of plastic bits, DIGGING her body out
     with his bare hands.  Once more, she comes up sputtering.

                               GIN
                     This one, I will not get!

     He's holding her in his arms.  Leans close.

                               MAC
                     But you will, you'll get it all.
                     You are actually...

     He kisses her.

                               MAC
                     Quite remarkable.

     Something in the way he looks at her.  Her return gaze is naked.
     It looks like love.

                               MAC
                     Take the rest of the evening off.

     And kisses her again.  Her eyes close.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH - MORNING

     Mac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's.   A
     short-wave radio is playing BBC World Service.  Leaning against an
     open laptop, is...

     ...Mac's stopwatch.  He glances up at it.  What he sees makes him
     reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw...

     ...a rectangular gun-metal gray DEVICE.  Looks like a cross between
     a remote control clicker and a large cell phone.  Turns it ON.  The
     power display GLOWS green.

     EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING

     Gin running alone.  Up the dirt path we've seen before.  Ahead, the
     crossroads, the sign.  The lonely phone booth.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac tuning the device, which is an advance-design SCANNER.  We HEAR
     overlapping CONVERSATIONS through bursts of STATIC...

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin at the phone.  Inserts her credit card.  Catches her breath.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac HEARS a phone RINGING over the scanner.  Punches RECORD, PLUGS
     the scanner INTO his laptop.

                               VOICE (O.S.)

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin in her throaty, playful voice...

                               GIN
                     ...no way I'm telling you shit.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     Baker, this is an extremely
                     dangerous g...

                               GIN
                    ...right now, you're more dangerous
                    than he is.

     A pause.  Her voice is smiling.  Not her eyes.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                    You want to explain th...

                               GIN
                    If I tell you what this is, and
                    where this is, you'll send back-up,
                    and those morons will blow my cover,
                    and I'll be too dead to accept your
                    apology.

     A longer beat.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're fucking him, aren't you?

                               GIN
                     Right to the wall.

     Her eyes are stone cold.  We've never seen her like this.  She
     looks like Mac.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're over your head, Baker.

                               GIN
                     Only romantically.  I'll write to
                     him in prison.

     She's pulling out a different piece of plastic.  A drug store phone
     card.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     Okay, it's your funeral.  Next time
                     I see you, I owe you a spanking.

                               GIN
                     Ooooo.  Is that a promise?

     Her cold eyes through his chuckle.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     While you're on secure, do you want
                     a transfer?

                               GIN
                     Nope.  I'm headed back to the hot
                     tub.  I'll call again, if I'm in
                     the mood.

     And hangs up.  Collects her thoughts.  Inserts the phone card.
     Dials from memory.  Fifteen digits.  She must be calling Mars.
     At last...

     ...a man's VOICE.  In a strange sing-song language.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Is it over?

     SMASH CUT TO...

     EXT. TIENANMEN SQUARE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Late night, mostly youngsters strolling the unfathomable vastness
     of the square.  At what seems an immeasurable distance, the huge
     illuminated portrait of Mao zedong hangs from the Gate of Heavenly
     Peace.  The scale of this place is unique in all the world.  PAN to
     a nearby parked...

     ...Mercedes.  COL. QIU of the People's Liberation Army, lounges at
     the wheel in full uniform.  Talks into his cellular...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...it's not over yet, it hasn't
                     even begun.

     He listens, winces.  We can hear Gin's voice yelling at him in
     Mandarin, dishing out a major piece of her mind.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...after Midnight, when his meeting
                     ends.  In Zhongnanhai.

     He doesn't like her attitude.  And there's plenty of it.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     The mask will be ready...

     A phalanx of TROOPS march past.  The Colonel turns his face to
     shadow.  Drops his voice...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     You fucking bring the bones.

     EXT. ZHONGNANKAI, BEIJING - LATE NIGHT

     The walled compound where the Politburo's elite work and live.
     From an open gateway...

     ...the MINISTER OF FINANCE appears, flanked by bodyguards in the
     drab green of PRC police.  They step onto the street and turn into
     a narrow hutong.  Down the alleyway comes a young man walking his
     bicycle through shadow.  Nearing us, he raises his right hand,
     and...

     ...SHOOTS each bodyguard TWICE through the chest, DROPS the bike,
     LURCHES at the Minister with something cylindrical and gleaming,
     and...

     ...SPRAYS the cowering official's FACE with something that makes
     him SCREAM in pain, the assassin RUNNING down the hutong for his
     life, as a fallen guard...

     ...SHOOTS him in the back, and he goes SPRAWLING, SKIDDING, face
     down.  Lifeless.

     INT. OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Col. Qiu walks beside a jaunty ophthalmologist, DR. HONGWEI, who
     is turning ON lights in the darkened office as they go.  Behind
     them, two PLA SOLDIERS half-carry the agonized minister.  Into an
     examination room...

     ...the minister gently set into an examining chair.  The doctor
     tilts the face up, shines a light into the minister's eyes, which
     makes him GROAN.  Eye drops now, which make the man YELP in pain.
     HONGWEI now moves the RETINAL SCANNER into position, resting the
     minister's chin on the slot provided.  Turns it ON.  The machine's
     panel FLASHES numbers in red lights.  Hongwei looks into the box
     from the reverse angle, to view...

     ...a red LASER SCAN moving across the pupil vertically, then
     retracing its path horizontally, left to right, right to left,
     up and down, at speed.

     Hongwei moves to a computer monitor with a graphic rendering of
     the retina, clicks the keypad to section off a slice of the
     graphic, and ENLARGES the section 100 times.  Looks like pixels.

     Back to the scanner.  Touch a button, and...

     ...a COMPACT DISC pops out of the disc drive.  He places it in a
     box, telling the minister...

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     We send this to the lab for finer
                     analysis.  One piece of advice,
                     huh...?

     The minister squints up, painfully.

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     No more red pepper in your eye.
                     Not for awhile.

     The doctor LAUGHS.  The minister seethes.  But Colonel Qiu...

     Has his mind.  On business.

     EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATE NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin's gloved hand, holding something we can scarcely see,
     as MIST floats up between us.  It is a carabiner with a nylon rope
     attached, and she CLIPS it to a thick wire.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     I'm freezing my tender parts.

     PULL BACK to see her in climbing harness, scaling a nearly-vertical
     CABLE, three feet in diameter.  Enveloped in fog which reveals,
     then conceals.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I'm relieved to hear you have some.

     PULL WAY BACK to see him below her.  The two of them climbing
     the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.  They are near the top, more than 700
     feet above the silvery black BAY.  A precarious, dizzying sight.

                               MAC
                     What's amazing, is that only eleven
                     workers died during construction of
                     this thing...

                               GIN (grim)
                     ...thanks for sharing...

                               MAC
                     Of course, the others were saved by
                     a safety net.

     Gin keeps her focus on the small railed PLATFORM just above her.  A
     gutsy gal.

                               MAC (loving it)
                     Now, as for the suicides, they
                     always jump facing the city.  Avoids
                     that tall fence about 50 stories down,
                     see it, there?

     She's at the platform.

                               GIN
                     I never liked you.

     Unclips one last time.  This won't be easy.  Throws her rope
     OVER the railing, and to her surprise, Mac braces himself with
     his legs...

     ...lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily
     to the platform.  Grateful, she hates to confess it.

                               GIN
                     One act of fucking human kindness...

                               MAC
                     Call it a lapse.

     And he swings lightly up beside her.  The fog has rolled past.
     There are several million stars.  Transcendent beauty.  She slows
     her breath...

                               GIN
                     And how does this fit into
                     the game pl...

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  We came for
                     the view.

     And from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal.
     Flutes, wrapped in velvet.  He POPS the cork in one motion, and it
     SAILS to its watery doom.  She can't help but watch.

     One more motion to pour both glasses.  Hands one to her.  Toasts...

                               MAC
                     To Ginger Baker.

     He clicks her glass.  She stares straight in his eye.  Shows no
     surprise, no fear...

                               GIN
                     I'm partial to drummers.  If they
                     played with Clapton and Winwood.

     And takes a sip.  Cool as a goose.  Licks her lips.

                               GIN
                     The prescription bottle.  When you
                     stole my suitcase.

     But he's not drinking.  Only staring.  The wind has picked up.

                               GIN
                     Armand Baker was my husband, May 13
                     to October 27, 1982, he played alto
                     sax, I was 17 years old.

     She takes another sip.  Good wine.

                               GIN
                     He named me Ginger.  He likes
                     drummers, too.

                               MAC
                     And you get sentimental for him.
                     Every time you order drugs.

                               GIN
                     I have I.D. in that name.  I use
                     it for various things I don't want
                     traced.  When credit unions turn
                     their computers my way.

                               MAC
                     I could listen to you lie all night.

     She toasts him.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Same here, fella.

     Slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she
     flinches.  Her eyes do flicker.  And follow.  He withdraws not a
     pistol, but a handful of...

                               MAC
                     Do you like diamonds?

     Nine DIAMONDS, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes
     from bugging.  Wow.

                               MAC
                     You asked.  Does the machine.
                     Make gold.

     Holy.  Christ.

                               MAC
                     Gold is shit.  It's six thousand
                     dollars a pound.  Worth your weight
                     in gold...?

     His eyes travel her body...

                               MAC
                     That would put you at seven
                     hundred thousand.

                               GIN
                     Would you pay it?

     And he leans.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     When the light hits you just
                     right.  I'd pay more.

     She liked that.  Maybe a lot.

                               GIN
                     The machine.  That we are stealing.
                     Makes diamonds?

     No answer.

                               GIN
                     Real ones?

                               MAC
                     Gem quality.  First ever.  God
                     save Japan.

     He toasts Blessed Japan to the East.  Takes a hit.

                               MAC
                     A diamond reactor takes graphite,
                     runs it through a combination of
                     lasers, electron beams, and scanning-
                     tunnel mg microscopes.

     He means this.  She is transfixed.

                               MAC
                     This one uses krypton-fluorine laser,
                     with a new isotope of krypton.

     She looks down at the diamonds in his palm.  His fist CLOSES.

                               MAC
                     The atoms are rearranged.  And
                     the molecule of graphite becoznes
                     a molecule of...

     He turns his fist UPSIDE-DOWN.  And LETS GO!  She GASPS as the
     brilliant stones FALL toward the sea.  Watching, watching, long
     after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated.  A hush.

                               GIN
                     I hate it.  When you make
                     a point.

     INT. SHIKOKU MARU - DAY

     CLOSE on two open PASSPORTS.  The names say BANQUO MACDUFF and
     ISADORA DUNCAN.  The faces are Mac and Gin.

                               STEWARD (O.S.)
                     All right, then.  All set.

     PULL BACK to see Mac and Gin dressed as tropical tourists.  She
     hangs on his arm.

                               STEWARD
                     We will keep your passports in
                     our safe until Jakarta.

                               MAC
                     Of course.

                               STEWARD
                     You are Suite 16...

                               GIN
                     ...and never been kissed.

     The steward doesn't get it.  Gin shrugs, sorry.

                               MAC
                     We had booked Suite 9.

                               STEWARD
                     16 is our Tokugawa Suite, far
                     superior, trust me.

     Mac consents.  A little wary.

                               STEWARD
                     You luggage is in the room, these
                     are your keys, the housekeeper
                     will show you t...

                               GIN (pouting)
                     Oh.  Can't we stroll around the
                     port?  Just a little?

     The steward checks his watch.

                               STEWARD
                     I'd be on board in forty minutes.
                     Just to be safe.

                               GIN (sweet smile)
                     Better safe.  Than sorry.

     EXT. DOCK, COLOMBO, SRI LANKA - DAY

     Mac and Gin stroll down the gangway, to the seedy, dangerous-
     looking wharf.  At the bottom of the gangway...

     ...a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests.  Each
     stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to ABOARD or ASHORE.  Mac
     moves the peg for 16...

     ...to the ABOARD position.

     And off they go.

     INT. SMALL PLANE - NIGHT

     Mac in his jump suit piloting the Dehaviland DHC-53 across the
     endless black of the Indian Ocean.  For the moment, he seems alone.
     Then...

                               MAC
                     Down there.  Ten o'clock.

     He means a tiny grouping of LIGHTS.  Way down there, against the
     darkness.  He switches on the AUTOPILOT.  Goes back to...

     ...Gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear
     just beside the window of the jump door.  Next to her, a pack that
     is even larger.  No fear in her eyes tonight.  Pure adrenaline.

                               GIN
                     Are you dumping fuel?

                               MAC
                     Changed my mind.  There's nothing
                     on the instruments downrange.  The
                     longer she flies before she ditches,
                     the less chance they notice on the
                     Bridge.

     As she stands, he begins to strap the huge pack ONTO her body.
     Jesus.  With her chute, and the other gear attached, the load makes
     us uneasy.  Not her.

                               MAC
                     You should lose the oxygen tank
                     at 8000 feet.

                               GIN
                     And how do I judge that?  Babe's
                     intuition?

     He points to an altimeter device on his wrist.  It says 12,000
     feet.  She cuts him a look.

                               GIN
                     So I just ask you on the way down?
                     Or were you planning to e-mail me.

     He pulls out an identical device.  Strapping it to her wrist...

                               MAC
                     I hate a crybaby.

     He straps the even-larger gear pack to himself.  Checks the path of
     the tiny lights far below.  Then, looks in her eyes...

                               MAC (simply)
                     You can do this.

     Not merely reassurance.  Affection.  Something connective between
     them.  You are my partner.  Her eyes send back that personal bond,
     and she nods.  I can do this.  Good girl.

     He pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles.  She does the same.  He OPENS
     the door, air BLASTING in.  One more look down below, and he holds
     up ten fingers.  Counts them down, nine...eight...

     She moves to the edge.  Watching him.  And on zero, she...
     ARCHES out INTO the starry VOID, and we go...

     WITH HER, the incomparable RUSH of freefall, straining to see him
     FOLLOW, skillfully altering his position to gain on her, coming
     close.  She is looking between him and her altimeter, as...

     ...his oxygen tank FALLS AWAY, and she CUTS hers loose, the air
     RUSHING past her, she looks DOWN...

     ...the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the
     freighter.  Back up to Mac, as he...

     PULLS his CHUTE, it is black and square, and JOLTS him to what
     seems like a full STOP far above her, and she YANKS her cord,
     but...

     ...nothing.  It doesn't open.  She is ROCKETING down, looking back
     up to see Mac make an exaggerated CUTTING sign across his body, and
     she closes her eyes, PULLS her secondary chute, which...

     POPS open, JARRING her violently, and she GASPS with the shock.  He
     is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to
     manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the
     freighter LOOMS in distance, she looks down and suddenly...

     ...the sea is RUSHING at her, she FIGHTS her braking mechanism,
     SHOUTING at herself...

                               GIN
                     FLARE, FLARE...

     ...and SLAMS INTO the water, PLUNGING down, twisting, disoriented
     CUTTING her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic
     to BREAK her light tube, which...

     ...GLOWS yellow-green, illuminating the freezing depths, she FITS
     it around her head, fights now to pull out the small ELECTRIC FAN
     we've seen before, KICKING herself toward the surface, fighting
     against the weight of her gear pack, she...

     ...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a PROPELLER which ROCKETS
     her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries
     desperately to hang on with one hand, but it...

     ...PULLS FREE, goes SHOOTING off into the blackness without her,
     one instant of TERROR in her eyes, and...

     Mac is THERE, diving at her with his propeller, she GRASPS his legs
     in a death grip, and suddenly, they are...

     AT the surface, Gin GASPING for air, and he CUTS his propeller,
     CRADLES her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear...

                               MAC
                     It's over, it's over...

     Her eyes are wild.

                               MAC
                     Catch your breath, quickly.
                     Hang on for the wake.

     She sees the FREIGHTER now, a black mountain CUTTING the sea, a
     huge WAKE pluming from its bow.  She grabs his waist with all
     she's got.

                               GIN
                     DO IT! GO!

     And he KICKS the propeller to LIFE, they ZOOM off, straight AT the
     towering wake and burst THROUGH it, RACING to the freighter's
     looming hull, speeding alongside, Mac looking up to find...

     ...a series of metal RUNGS, which begin twelve feet above the water
     line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far
     above.  Mac has a Kevlar rope with a GRAPPLING HOOK, and as he
     reaches the rungs, he...

     ...THROWS it high, one of the pronged hooks CATCHING on a rung
     twenty feet above them...

                               MAC
                     HOLD TIGHT!

                               GIN
                     IF YOU FUCKING INSIST!

     And he LETS GO of the propeller, PULLING both of them, laden with
     gear, OUT of the water with sheer brute strength.  PLANTING his
     feet against the outward curve of the hull, he CLIMBS with all his
     strength, hand over hand, until he finally...

     ...GRASPS the bottom rung.  He PULLS them up, until she can GRAB
     ON.  They hold tight to their rung for a beat.  He attaches them
     both with metal carabiner clips.

                               MAC
                     If I were you, I'd watch
                     the desserts.

                               GIN
                     Boy, I'll bet you were in
                     shape before you got old.

                               MAC
                     Too long ago to remember.

     And pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an
     the first.  Offers her his hand...

                               GIN
                     I can take it from here, thanks.

     Suit yourself.  They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted
     backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go.

                               GIN
                     If you'd packed my primary chute
                     right, I wouldn't ha...

                               MAC
                     Yes, you would.  You're a girl.

     Up, up.  And stop.  They are nearly halfway to the top.  Looking
     across the curved hull to...

     ...a large circular HATCH.  Thirty feet away.  The goal.  Mac
     pulls from his pack...

     ...their SUCTION CUP gear.  With practiced speed, they fasten cups
     to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups
     attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to...

     ...move LATERALLY across the hull's surface toward the hatch.  Mac
     is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like
     a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull.  Gin is deter-
     mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal
     solid one.  Dark water RACES by beneath her.,  By the time she looks
     up at the hatch...

     He is gone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Anytime you're ready.

     She looks UP sharply.  He is ABOVE the hatch, attached to the hull
     by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat.  Noting her
     astonishment...

                               MAC
                     Better angle.

     That it is.  He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack.  It's a
     battery-operated AIR WRENCH, and with a menacing WHIRR, only
     partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly POP all
     the rivets around the hatch.

     Gin has pulled out the slender WELDING TOOL we saw in the shower,
     and begins CUTTING through the metal seals around the hatch's rim.

     At thecrucial moment...

                               MAC
                     You might want to move aside...

     Which she BARELY does, as the hatch door PLUMMETS past her to the
     sea.  BIG splash.  Gone.  When she turns back, Mac is already
     THROUGH the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps
     partially revealing...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  We've seen this with Carlsby.  The
     fork lift.  The shadowy multitude of PLATFORMS on their gimbals,
     all SWAYING, in different directions with the plunging of the ship.
     Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort
     Knox.  The ROAR of the engines is louder here, and he moves close
     to her to speak beneath it...

                               MAC
                     May I trouble you for the torch?
                     Or would you rather just dance.

     Oh.  Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency,
     she tries to find the thing in her gear.  After watching her fumble
     for a bit...

                               GIN
                     I know I packed it.

     ...he just reaches in and pulls it out.  A small LANTERN which he
     FLICKS on, brilliantly ILLUMINATING the entire hold.  Scans the
     platforms...polnts to a CRATE wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic
     membrane.

                               MAC
                     Coal into diamonds.  A wealth
                     machine.

                               GIN
                     How do you know that's it?

                               MAC (as if stating the obvious)
                     It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's
                     the only thing worth waterproofing,
                     in case the ship sinks.

                               GIN (softly)
                     ...you twit.

                               MAC
                     Hmmn?

                               GIN
                     I'm just finishing your sentence.
                     Can't you answer a question with-
                     out making me feel stupid?

     He's heading toward the swaying platforms...

                               MAC
                     Why would I bother?

     He is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the
     magic crate.  She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it
     look.  She has to scramble, almost falling.  He's already pulled
     from his gear...

     ...six rubber POUCHES.  She hands him her welding tool, and he
     begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate.

     The plunging ship has the platform really rocking.

                               GIN (concerned)
                     They don't look like flotation
                     bags...

                               MAC (working fast)
                     Shit.  Well then, let's forget
                     the whole thing.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     Okay, it was a dumb ques...

     His eyes come UP.  So fast that her breath stops.  He looks plenty
     angry.

                               MAC
                     Let's get one thing straight.  I
                     don't work with partners much,
                     because basically, I find most
                     people to be idiots.

     She swallows.  Hard.

                               MAC
                     You, in contrast, are first-rate.

     He watches the effect of that play across her eyes.

                               MAC
                     And if I think so.  Maybe you
                     should start thinking the same.
                     Now move your ass.

     And goes back to work.  She pauses a beat.  Then pulls out two
     lengths of Kevlar rope.  Begins securing their platform to the one
     above, to minimize the amount of sway.  As she struggles with this,
     she sees him finish by welding a very small gray BOX to the top of
     the crate.

     When he glances up, he sees her staring at the box.

                               MAC
                     GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled
                     signal by satellite...

     He touches the device.  It BEEPS.  A light glows RED.

                               MAC
                     Precise coordinates.  You could
                     find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert.

     He rises.  JUMPS down to the floor.

                               GIN
                     Where you g...

                               MAC (walking away)
                     Fork lift.

                               GIN
                     That's my assignm...

                               MAC (turning back)
                     Unless you've got the keys,
                     someone has to hot wire it.

     Oh.

                               MAC
                     Finish up on the floaters.

     And heads off toward the fork lift.  Finish up?  She looks at
     the rubber pouches.  They seem finished to her.  Tugs at a couple.
     On pretty firmly.  Across the way, we HEAR the fork lift turn its
     engine OVER.

                               GIN
                     Won't they hear it?

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Over these engines?  Through five
                     feet of steel?

     She hurriedly secures the last of her Kevlar lines.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Hell, if they do, they don't have
                     the second key to get in.

     He is driving up in the rickety fork lift.  Weaving around crates
     and equipment.

                               MAC
                     Thank God for redundant security.

     He hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down
     INTO his arms.  Quickly, the switch places, Gin climbing into the
     idling fork lift, as Mac clambers up to UNBOLT the crate's pallet
     with his air wrench...

     Gin moves the fork lift into position.  Mac bracing his legs
     against neighboring cargo, using all his strength to hold our
     crate steady.  He is really straining.

                               GIN
                     How many tries do I get?

                               MAC (with effort)
                     One, before I beat you senseless,
                     dump you over the side, and donate
                     your share to charity.

     She brings the fork UP.  The crate sways slightly.  She lines up
     her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes...

                               GIN
                     You gotta work on that impatient
                     streak.

     ...and slips them straight IN.  First try.

                               GIN (amazed)
                     How professional.

     She LIFTS the crate, but the boat LURCHES, and she nearly LOSES it
     off the fork.

     But she doesn't.  SWINGS her load around now.  Heading for the open
     hatchway, the roiling sea racing by.  Picking up SPEED, slightly...

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Thing on the left is
                     the brakes?

                               MAC (laconic)
                     Or the thing on the right.

     By now she is really ROLLING toward the wide open spaces...

                               GIN
                     MAC, IT'S JAMMED!

     He POUNCES off the platform, FLYING after the lift as it
     ACCELERATES THROUGH the opening...

                               MAC
                     JUMP, for God's sa...

     ...TIPPING at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding OFF the prongs,
     our forklift TUMBLING OUT the hatch to the sea, just as Mac...

     ...SNATCHES Gin by her HAIR, pulling her FREE of the falling
     forklift, CATCHING the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, Gin
     SCREAMING in fright and pain, BLINDLY grabbing his arm to be...

     ...jerked BACK to safety.

     Clutching Mac, she watches the sea behind them.  Where the crate
     and the forklift disappeared.

                               MAC
                     You did activate the floaters.

     Her head WHIPS around.  Aghast.

                               GIN
                     Activa...

                               MAC
                     I did say, 'Finish up on the
                     floaters'.  Surely, you heard me.

     Her life.  Flashes before her eyes.  As behind the ship...

     ...the crate BOBS to the surface.  We can see the tiny red light on
     the transponder from here.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Oh.  Guess I did it m'self.

     She WHIPS back, and starts POUNDING at him with her fists.  He is
     laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can GRASP her
     wrists.  She SPITS in his face.  He strikes back by...

     ...kissing her hard.  She struggles for a beat.

     And then she lets him.

     When they finish, he reaches to UNZIP her jumping suit.  All the
     way.  Pulls it down gently, revealing...

     ...her evening gown.  A wrinkle-free material which slips down
     across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips.
     He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his
     own.  He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only...

     ...her evening bag and shoes.  Then lifting both packs, he...

                               GIN
                     Um...

     ...FLINGS them into the black ocean.  Gone.

                               GIN
                     ...I wouldn't do that.

     So he turns.  She looks really stunned.  And scared.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me?

                               GIN
                     Well...I saw our suction things.
                     Lying...over...there?

     She points.  To where no suction things are lying.

                               GIN (a mouse)
                     ...so I put 'em in my pack?

     His eyes WIDEN.

                               GIN
                     Or maybe.  I put 'em there.

     And points.  To where they are.

     She tilts her head.  Gives him a great smile.  Is he enraged?  His
     dry grin says, not hardly.

                               MAC
                     I like a quick study.

     Then again.  You can never tell.

     EXT. FREIGHTER DECK - NIGHT

     Expansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.  A silver-haired
     couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to
     barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.  She clings to
     his arm, it is romantic.  Until they reach the railing where he
     turns, and says something quietly in German...

     She stiffens.  Pulls her arm away from his.  She sneers coldly,
     calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of
     German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.  She absorbs the
     abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and...

     ...SPITS over the side.  Strides away from him.  He watches her go.
     Then...

     ...SPITS over the side himself.  And follows her.

     Half a beat.

     Mac's head APPEARS above the rail.  Just where they spit.  Not a
     mark on him.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Our old German couple are DANCING wonderfully in each other's arms
     Inspiring.  PAN a dozen really old couples dancing to the three-
     piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to...

     Gin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the
     surrounding geezers that they are very much in love.  We CLOSE to
     hear their sweet murmurings...

                               MAC
                     ...no matter how many stones we
                     make, the diamonds are just an
                     appetizer.

                               GIN (dreamily)
                     And the meal...?

                               MAC
                     My contract.  With DeBeers.

     She blinks.  Hit by a ton of bricks.

                               GIN
                     Oh my G...

                               MAC
                     Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world
                     monopoly in diamonds based on one
                     simple principle...something's only
                     priceless if it's scarce.

     He WHIRLS her in a tight spin.  The geriatic Germans can only watch
     and envy.

                               MAC
                     These guys dig up all the diamonds
                     on the planet, just to keep them out
                     of circulation.  Otherwise, you could
                     buy 'em at the Five and Dime...

                               GIN
                     Watch the old guy stuff, they don't
                     have dimestores anym...

                               MAC
                     Imagine the chaos we could cause.

     She is imagining.

                               GIN
                     You said 'contract'...

                               MAC
                     We're sort of bounty hunters.

     Gin likes the ring of that.  Green eyes dance with delight.

                               MAC
                     Our machine is worth far more
                     dead.  Than alive.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                     Glad to see you're both alive.

     They look over.  The officious STEWARD from this afternoon.  Now in
     black tie.

                               STEWARD
                     When you missed cocktails.  And
                     supper.  I thought of knocking
                     on your door...

     Mac turns Gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile...

                               GIN
                     Oh, I wish you had.  We love having
                     strangers join us!  Maybe later...?

     Mac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward
     across her bare shoulder...

                               MAC
                     Promise you an interesting time...

     Trademark smile.

                               MAC
                     Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff.

     You twit.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Our couple moving down the softly-lit hallway, past the burnished
     doors of luxury suites.  Her arms wrapped around one of his, their
     bodies close together.

                               MAC
                     ...well, I would ask what you're
                     doing with the rest of your life.
                     But that's your own bloody affair,
                     isn't it?

     She sighs.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  Anyway, before you get too
                     choked up on the farewell.  I feel
                     I owe you a confession.

     He glances down.  Really?  Really.

                               GIN
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     He thinks about this.  And then...

                               MAC
                     Not here.

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     Mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to...

     ...the BOWSPRIT, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail,
     it juts far out above a churning sea.  The whipping of the wind
     makes it seem all the more precarious.

                               MAC
                     It only looks dangerous...

     Holds out his hand.  She hesitates.

                               MAC
                     You couldn't fall off.  Unless
                     someone threw you over.

     Gives her the smile.  She puts her hand in his, and they hop
     UP to the platform.  Walk its length to the very end.  He turns
     now, leans casually against the fragile railing.  They are inches
     apart.

                               MAC
                     More intimate.  For a confession.

     Gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow.

                               MAC
                     What business.  You are actually.
                     In.

     She looks up.  To his eyes.  Into them.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  I'm not an art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  You're a cop.

     And tilts his head.  Just to one side.

                               MAC
                     An insurance investigator for
                     Webber Assurance, your boss is
                     an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've
                     been there four years and ten
                     months, you're quite the rising star.

                               GIN (evenly)
                     Nope.

     His head tilts.  Just a little farther.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     Nope?

                               GIN
                     I'm a thief, Mac.

     Holds the look.

                               GIN
                     For five years, I've used the
                     database of every client Webber
                     has to plan my jobs.  Museums,
                     banks, jewelers, rich people, I
                     have floor plans, alarm codes,
                     passwords, the works.

     His face absolutely neutral.  Unreadable.

                               GIN
                     I've made a fortune.  It's not
                     enough.

                               MAC
                     Why n...

                               GIN
                     Why wasn't it enough for you?

     He falls silent.

                               GIN
                     The Vermeer that was stolen from
                     Hancock Tower?  That was my job.
                     I scaled the building with
                     electromagnets, and parachuted
                     down an air vent...

     No smile at her lips.  Strictly business.

                               GIN
                     ...after mailing the painting.  To
                     where we're going next, actua...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     We.

     She looks him up and down.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, we.  You passed the audition.

     Now he smiles.  First time.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Imagine my relief.

                               GIN
                     I need a partner.  For the biggest,
                     smartest, job.  Ever.  The one you
                     retire off of, because nothing else
                     could ever compare with the rush.

                               MAC
                     Ever.  Is such a long time.

                               GIN
                     This is a job that can only be done
                     in one place, in one split-second
                     in human history.  If we miss that
                     instant.  We lose.

                               MAC
                     And it's worth...?

                               GIN
                     Eight billion dollars.  That's
                     eight thousand million.

                               MAC
                     How much in shillings?

                               GIN
                     You're not a real trusting guy.

                               MAC
                     And I tried so hard to hide that.

                               GIN
                     It's two jobs.  The first steals
                     something priceless from the National
                     Palace Museum in Taipei.  We don't
                     keep that.  We trade it in for our
                     ticket to the show.

                               MAC
                     One moment in time, you s...

                               GIN
                     Midnight, July 1, 1997.  Eight
                     days from now.  The moment that
                     Hong Kong is annexed by china.

     And now.  She has his interest.  She can see that.

                               GIN
                     80-20 split.

                               MAC
                     Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's
                     your plan, you should take at least
                     thirty perc...

                               GIN
                     My 80, your 20.  Asshole.

     He thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei.

     She is not impressed.  Or afraid.  He grins...

                               MAC
                     What are you gonna do with six
                     billion dollars that you can't do
                     with four?

                               GIN
                     Hold the record.  Alone.

     This.  He likes.  So much that he leans to kiss her, with
     surprising tenderness.

                               MAC
                     Your share is 50%.  And one dollar.

     Her hard stare.  And then, she smiles.  Just barely.  Still in his
     arms...

                               GIN
                     I like what you left.  In the hold.

                               MAC
                     You didn't even see wha...

                               GIN
                     A lump of coal.  A pair of pliers.
                     A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'.

     This is the most taken with her that he has ever looked.  She leans
     up and kisses him.  Whispers...

                               GIN
                     Squeeze hard.

     EXT. STREET, SHIHLIN DISTRICT, TAIPEI - LATE NIGHT

     Ugly section of an ugly town.  Unmarked warehouses, alleyways
     teeming with food stalls.  HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see...

     ...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.  Going real fast, maybe she's
     showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly
     WHEELS them into...

     ...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She climbs off, he doesn't.  As Gin
     goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner,
     mewing softly.

                               GIN
                     That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's
                     my bud.  An evil streak a mile wide.

     The elevator JOLTS to life.

                               MAC
                     No surprise.

     They CLANG upward.  Mac seems utterly relaxed.  Gin paces a little,
     hugging herself.  Her features tense.

                               MAC (gently)
                     Tired?

     She blinks up.  He is straddling the bike.  Smiling at her.

                               GIN
                     I have a lot on my mind.

     Ah.  Well...

                               MAC
                     You look beautiful doing it.

     He seems to mean that.  And it seems to melt her a little.  She
     sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as...

     ...they JOLT to a stop.  She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door
     SLIDES noisily open, to reveal...

     ...a gigantic LOFT.  She flicks on a dim light, but we see only
     part of the cavernous space.  She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting
     along behind.  Mac follows, looking around, then down to see...

     ...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.  The unopened MAILING TUBE we
     saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.  He crouches, lifts the tube in
     his hands...

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     You wanna buy a Vermeer?

                                    MAC
                     Rather steal it.

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     Been there, done that.

     He nods to himself.  Guess so.  He rises to see her framed against
     the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.  The twinkling
     island lies below.  But here, Gin stares down at...

     ...an elaborate architectural MODEL.  Fifteen feet across, it
     features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into
     the side of a model MOUNTAIN.  Formal gardens, fountains, tiny
     Kuomintang flags.  Stretching away from the building, a large
     portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed.
     As Mac joins her...

                               GIN
                     National Palace Museum, Taipei,
                     Taiwan.  Repository of four
                     thousand years of Chinese culture...

     He bends to lift UP the detachable roof.  All the rooms are
     detailed within, down to exhibit cases.

                               GIN
                     Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx,
                     pots and scrolls, paintings and
                     porcelains and lacquer work.  Every
                     treasure the Kuomintang could loot
                     before the Reds took over.
                               (beat)
                     Ever rob the place?

                               MAC
                     No.  If memory serves.

     She takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway,
     walking straight toward it...

                               GIN
                     You need to eat something, or
                     are you ready for sex?

     And just at the edge of it...

                               MAC (torn)
                     The options seem so limited.

     They jump THROUGH the opening.  And VANISH.

     Our ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a
     jewel against the hillside...

     ...the NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, looking exactly like the model.  The
     town spread out beyond.  Just as in the model.  And now we TILT
     sharply DOWN to see...

     ...a loading PLATFORM, suspended above the island, only a few feet
     below our opening.  Like a balcony without a railing.  Mac and Gin
     already sinking down onto a waiting futon.

     Looks like he's made his pick.  Among limited options.

     INT. LOFT - SUNRISE

     CLOSE on the MODEL MUSEUM in early light.  Propped against it, the
     unrolled Vermeer.  Pinned to the painting, a note we can't read.  In
     the B.G., HEAR what sounds like the rattling of a SUBWAY TRAIN,
     which runs a short distance and STOPS.  We TILT ANGLE now, to
     see...

     ...through the sunlit opening of the loading door.  Mac's head
     APPEARS, peeking up over the lip.

                               MAC
                     Ginny...?

     LOST in another brief subway rumble.  He lightly VAULTS up through
     the doorway.  Looks around, no Gin.  Goes to the model.  Lifts the
     note pinned to the Vermeer...

                               MAC (reads)
                     This lovely parting gift can be
                     yours.  If the price is right.

     Stumped.  Not in his cultural database.  He looks at the model, to
     see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been
     lifted away, revealing...

     ...an underground RAILWAY TUNNEL between the two.  Mac examines the
     tiny train, the tracks, the winding route.  From the side walls,
     well above the tracks, huge VENTILATION PIPES open onto the tunnel.
     Starting at the museum end, they are labeled VENT #1, and so on.
     There are five.  The last one shortly before...

     ...the mountain.  Where a cavernous opening is labeled BARRACKS.
     Tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot
     at the oncoming train.  And as Mac studies this curiously...

     ...the nearby SUBWAY RATTLES the walls once more.  Sounds like it's
     in the room, somehow.  Mac rises.  Saunters across the loft, and we
     see for the first time the enormity of this space.  Suddenly, the
     floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto...

     ...a spacious HANGAR, outfitted with 150 feet of RAILWAY TRACK, at
     the far end of which sits a full-sited TRAIN CAR, exactly like the
     one in the model.  And just below us...

     ...Gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen
     feet above the track.  She holds a remote control device, which she
     uses to REV the train's engine, far down the line.  She looks
     really tense.

                               MAC
                     Good morning.

     She startles slightly.  Shuts OFF the train's engine.  As she looks
     up to him now, the silence is noticeable.  He crouches down, only a
     foot or so above her...

                               MAC
                     Quite a parting gift.  I would
                     have settled for roses.

                               GIN
                     It's a joke.  You know, a joke?
                     People who have a sense of humor
                     make them?

     He's clueless.  But smiling.

                               GIN
                     You're rich, go buy an American,
                     have him fill you in on the culture.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  American culture.  Well,
                     that is a joke.

     He leans down.  Strokes her hair very gently.

                               MAC (murmurs)
                     Relax.  It's only eight billion
                     dollars.

     She looks up into his eyes.  But she can't smile.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of
                     Delft better than the larger one.
                     The sky is more emotionally rendered.

     Staring in his eyes.  And just as softly back...

                               GIN
                     Nice.  When a sky is that.

     He holds the look.  Very strong and very gentle...

                               MAC
                     Is it easier now? Not pretending.

     Is it?

                               MAC
                     Not pretending you're an innocent.
                     Not pretending you...like me.

     No answer.  Effortlessly, he hops down to join her.  Never losing
     eye contact.

                               MAC
                     Here's a tip from an old-timer.
                     Never forget who you are...

     Settles next to her.  Bodies touching.

                               MAC
                     It gives you someone to be.  When
                     you stop pretending.

     Okay?  She nods, slowly.  Her eyes moving over his face.  Maybe
     more feelings going through her than she can sort out.

                               MAC (still soft)
                     So.  Our train runs from the museum,
                     through an underground tunnel.  To
                     a mountain.

                               GIN
                     Because the museum displays 10,000
                     relics at any given moment.  But
                     there are 60 times that many, stored
                     in the mountain.

     This overwhelms.  Even Mac.

                               GIN
                     Which is why it's guarded.  By an
                     army.

     She is unfastening the small pack at her feet...

                               GIN
                     The train shuttles relics to and
                     from storage.  It looks exactly
                     like that.

     So Mac looks down the line.  At the train car.

                               GIN
                     I've been down the air ducts four
                     times.  The train always has two
                     armed guards.  Always travels between
                     32 and 36 miles per hour.  Relics
                     don't like to be jostled too much.

                               MAC (all business now)
                     Your model has five vents.

                               GIN
                     We go down the first.  Back up the
                     third, if you're lucky.  If not, we
                     have to get out by the fourth.

                               MAC (simply)
                     Then we will.

     She pulls from the pack four thick DISCS, each about eight inches
     in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop.  She
     starts to put two of them on...

                               GIN
                     Electromagnets, incredibly powerful.
                     This switch is on-off.

     He gestures at the train, the track, the hangar...

                               MAC
                     Seems like overkill.  For one
                     simple jump.

                               GIN
                     Well, it's an eight billion
                     dollar jump.  You miss the
                     train...you've missed the train.

     Flicks ON her remote.  Down the track the engine REVS.  Like crazy.

                               GIN
                     We've got five days to grab the
                     Bones, trade them for the Scan, and
                     pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong.
                     Once midnight passes on July 1st...

                               MAC
                     ...we've missed the train, yeh.
                     The Bones?  The Scan?

                               GIN
                     Oh.  Have I neglected to fill
                     in the details?

                               MAC
                     An oversight.

                               GIN
                     Which I learned from the master.
                     Hey.  Wish me luck...

     CLICKS the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36 MPH never seemed so
     fast!  She has a split-second to LEAP down, the train SAILS beneath
     her, Gin's feet GRAZE the back end of the platform at the rear of
     the car, she SWIPES DESPERATELY with the magnets, can't connect,
     and is THROWN into a ROLL along the side of the tracks.

     She's UP on her knees, watching the train SLAM into the massive
     blue PADS at the end of the track.  She is bruised, shaken, but
     most of all, really worried and really pissed.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Jump sooner.

     She pulls out the remote...

                               GIN
                     Be my fucking guest.

     The train ROCKETS backward, straight PAST where she kneels, to
     BRAKE at the start of the track once more.  She nods up to Mac,
     who is strapping on his magnets.  He crouches, nods, ready.  And
     the train...

     ...BLASTS toward him, he counts, JUMPS, and SLAMS ONTO the ROOF of
     the train, which PLOWS into the heavy padding, FLINGING him twenty
     feet like a rag doll to land in a HEAP.

     He lies still.  Then blinks, surprised he's alive.  HEARS a rich
     whiskey LAUGHTER down the track.

                               MAC
                     I'm too old for this shit!

     And as he pulls himself up.  She is staring at him, from her
     knees...

                               GIN
                     Know a dude named Wiley Coyote?

     ...with what can only be described as love.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Forget it.

     EXT. NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, TAIPEI - DAY

     AERIAL VIEW down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the MUSEUM,
     the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway.  CLOSE
     now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges...

     She is first.  Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing
     endless legs.  She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer
     who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making
     quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction.

     She takes his arm for support.  Murmurs in his ear...

                               GIN
                     Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending?

     Gives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders
     noticing.  Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering
     close...

                               GIN
                     Five years, you won't need
                     make-up.

     In answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract-
     ing attention all around.  His turn to whisper, as he massages
     her backside...

                               MAC
                     We agreed.  No underwear.

                               GIN
                     Overkill.  I can do it with legs.

     He stops.  Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over.

                               MAC
                     I'd lose the underwear.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Mac leaning on her arm, as they pass case after case.  Bronzes,
     jades, lacquer work.  Every object exquisite, priceless.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bones date back to the
                     Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago.
                     They are writings...carved into
                     ox bones, tortoise shells...

     She cuddles close to him.  They approach a tour group, the female
     guide speaking in four European languages.  Really loud.

                               GIN
                     The oldest Chinese writing any-
                     where, the first proof of Chinese
                     civilization.

                               MAC
                     What makes this one so valuable?

     He stops, drowned out by the tour guide, rhapsodizing over an urn.
     Butts into her rap...

                               MAC (subtitled Italian)
                     Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking
                     Sung Period.  The color is far too
                     delicate.

     The woman gets real insulted.  Apparently, he's right.

                               MAC (subtitled German)
                     It's all right, you have a nice
                     body.

     And walks on.  Confides to Gin...

                               MAC
                     When you're old, you can do
                     anything

     GRABS her bottom once more, altering her voice slightly on...

                               GIN
                     There we are.

     A separate display room.  A single steel pedestal.  Under the
     smart-glass security case, one single object.  It is a fragile,
     yellowed fragment of bone.  The shoulder blade of an ox.  Covered
     with tiny script.

                               GIN
                     Last year, ancient artifacts were
                     discovered in the Gulf of Mexico.
                     An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old.

     No tourists in the display room.  A velvet rope is up.  Three
     GUARDS mill at the entrance.  This exhibit is off-limits.

                               GIN
                     Amazingly, markings on these
                     Olmec figures were identified
                     as Shang Dynasty writing...

     A sign explains, SORROWFUL TO INFORM ORACAL BONE CLOSE FOR TRAVEL
     EXIBITION UNTIL IS NOVEMBER.

                               GIN
                     This particular Bone is price-
                     less, because it is the one that
                     establishes the link.  Proves that
                     American civilizations descend from
                     Chinese ancestors.

     She is pulling out her coin purse, as they stand by the rope.
     Unzipping it slowly...

                               GIN
                     Exactly the kind of propaganda
                     shit they eat up in Beijing.  The
                     mainland would pay anything to get
                     its paws on th...

     As her shaking 'elderly' companion SPASMS, knocking the purse OUT
     of her hand, it CLATTERS to the floor, sending a hundred coins
     ROLLING in all directions.  Some under the rope.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     SHIT!  BLOODY HELL!!!

     And collapses to the hardwood floor in search of the coins, HOWLING
     as he BANGS his knees.  Some bystanders hurry to help.  And one of
     the guards.  As Mac tries to crawl under the rope to pursue
     coins...

     ...the guard STOPS him with a firm hand, pointing at the pidgen-
     English sign.  Meanwhile, calmly, very slowly...

     ...Gin crouches down to retrieve coins, the short skirt riding
     recklessly high on her upper thighs.  The two remaining guards
     hurry to help her.  Mac's guard, bystanders, all transfixed by the
     marginal preservation of her modesty.  Noticing the eye-lines all
     around, she confides to the nearest guard...

                               GIN (in Mandarin, helpful)
                     Those are the coins.  These
                     are my legs.

     Unnoticed, Mac is BANGING his wristwatch, which seems to have
     broken.  CLOSE on him now, manipulating a glide point DEVICE on
     the side of the watch, and we RACK FOCUS to see...

     ...one coin.  Inside the rope.  Move.

     As Mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere, he guides the coin's
     slide slowly, inexorably, to...

     ...ATTACH itself magnetically.  To the steel pedestal.  Beneath the
     Bone's case.  As it does, Mac's watch BEEPS slightly, as we CLOSE
     on it to see...

     ...DATA flickering across its face.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     Amanda!  Time for my pills!

     INT. NOODLE SHOP, TAIPEI - DAY

     Gin and Mac at a long communal table, ignored, by Taiwanese couples,
     families, businessmen, chattering loudly all around them.  Gin
     looking down at her bowl, she's barely touched her meal...

                               GIN
                     ...no, I don't think that way.

     Glances up.  Mac is eating heartily, happily.

                               GIN
                     ...and I suppose you do?

                               MAC
                     Get lonely?  Sure, all the time.
                     It's healthy.

     Stuffs his mouth full.  Talking around it...

                               MAC
                     What's unhealthy.  Is denial.

     She's studying him as he eats.  Since he's not looking at her,
     Gin's eyes are thoughtful, appraising.

                               GIN
                     Be real.  you could never see
                     yourself...you know, quitting the
                     game.  Settling...down.

     And he looks up.  Direct to her eyes.  A dead straight, heart-
     stopping look.  Before the wonderful smile.

                               MAC
                     Why, Ginger.  This is so sudden.

     She cuts him a hard look.  Not funny.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Late afternoon, the place has closed.  Four armed GUARDS,
     accompanied by a museum OFFICIAL, push a large DOLLY across the
     hardwood floor, heels clicking, wheels rumbling softly, into...

     ...the room we've seen.  The dolly stops by the display case of the
     priceless oracle Bone.  The four guards position themselves around
     the triple-paned bulletproof case.  It will be a bitch to lift.

     The official has a key.  He inserts this into the lock of the
     titanium frame which holds the case to the steel pedestal.  And
     as it CLICKS, we...

     SMASH CUT TO...

     INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY

     Mac's arm rising with noodle-laden chopsticks, the wristwatch
     BEEPING softly.  He drops the chopsticks, rising in one fluid
     motion as Gin does the same, throwing some bills on the table,
     he leads her...

     ...OUT the door, INTO the street, step OFF the curb, turn, DROP
     flat on his back, SLIDE DOWN the gutter, Gin following a split-
     second behind...

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     A train car stands, pulled up to a loading dock.  Two SOLDIERS with
     assault rifles on the train's rear platform, waiting.  Along one
     side of the tracks, a gravel roadway.  An open air Jeep-type
     military vehicle stands empty.  One of our soldiers speaks into a
     walkie-talkie, watching a huge steel DOOR at the entrance to the
     loading dock, which...

     ...OPENS now.  Through it come the four armed museum guards,
     surrounding the dolly which carries the Bone's massive bulletproof
     display case.  The official is with them, and hands paperwork to
     one of the waiting soldiers, as the museum guards LIFT the case,
     and carry it onto the train.

     INT. TUNNEL SHAFT

     An empty stretch of dimly-lit track, somewhere down the line.
     Silent.  PAN up, way up, to...

     ...the shadows of a huge air vent.  Must be vent #1, because two
     FIGURES are crouched there, as close as lovers.  Even we can barely
     make them out, until we CLOSE to hear the hushed...

                               GIN (strapping on a backpack)
                     ...way we can use those in here.
                     I thought I was in charge of
                     this operat...

                               MAC
                     You're in charge of ego and worrying.
                     I'm in charge of keeping you alive.

     He is holding something dull gray and small.  It looks like a trun-
     cated nerf football with one end pointed and the other cut blunt.

                               MAC
                     These are plasma jet.  All the
                     force is directed forward, instead
                     of dissipating in a sphere like a
                     grenade.

     He has four of these.  Gives her three.

                               GIN
                     I don't need th...

                               MAC (whispers)
                     Shut up.

     He reaches out, gently...

                               MAC
                     You don't trust me, you won't get
                     through this.

     Touches her face.

                               MAC
                     Try to adjust to that for three
                     more days.  After July 1...

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     ...you'll never have to trust again.

     And smiles.  One more whisper...

                               MAC
                     Something.  To look forward to.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     The museum guards are back on the landing with the official.  Our
     two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train
     car, as...

     The train RUMBLES to life.  Ready to go.

     INT. MUSEUM

     Two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty
     pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case.  One tilts the top
     of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to
     lift the base, and...

     ...stops.  He sees the coin.  Oddly flat against the pedestal's
     shaft.  He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet HOLDS it
     fast.  He looks up to his companion.  Then...

     ...PEELS the coin free, the other guard reaches for it, the first
     guard YANKS it away, and it FLIES from his hand, INTO the wall, and
     drops.  As the guards go to look, the coin's back has come away.
     Revealing...

     ...electronics.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     An ALARM SHRIEKS at a deafening level.  Five museum GUARDS BURST
     through the doorway, LEAP from the landing, pile into the Jeep, and
     BLAST OFF down the gravel roadway after the departed train.

     INT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE

     A much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel, facing back
     the opposite way.  The ALARM SCREAMS here, too, and massive steel
     doors CLANG open, as 25 SOLDIERS with assault rifles SWARM out onto
     the landing, taking up sharpshooter positions, weapons pointing
     back up the track.

     INT. AIR VENT #1

     Mac and Gin crouched in the vent, high above the track, gas masks
     dangle around their necks, magnet paddles from their wrists,
     various objects from their belt loops.  The alarm ECHOES,
     absolutely EAR-SPLITTING.  She leans to shout in his ear...

                               GIN
                     WE HAVE TO ABORT!

     Above the siren, we can now hear the TRAIN coming...

                               MAC
                     HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER
                     OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
                     INCONVENIENCE?

     The train LOUDER, closer, the alarm BLARING...

                               GIN
                     THEY'VE GOT AN ARMY DOWN TH...

                               MAC
                     I can do this.

     Quietly.  Straight in her eyes.  The train ROARS into view, FLASHES
     beneath them, as he GRABS her wrist and...

     ...JUMPS, HURTLING DOWN, both STRIKING the empty rear platform,
     Gin slipping off, but he HOLDS her fast, SWIPING with his magnet
     which...

     ...CLANKS hard, LOCKS solid.  He PULLS her onto the platform,
     she looks dazed, clinging to him, he tugs her gas mask into place,
     slips on his own, and...

     ...FITS a magnetic DEVICE from his belt loop ONTO the door
     lock, SPINS a dial on the device, which POPS the lack OPEN,
     Mac BURSTING...

     ...THROUGH the door, lobbing a GAS GRENADE at the startled guards,
     who try to whirl and FIRE through the fog of red smoke, two wild
     SHOTS above the rolling Mac, and they are felled by the gas where
     they stand.  Gin races in, falling on her butt, as the car ROCKS
     along the track.  Points OUT the window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY
                     45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD!

     Scrambling to her feet, Mac wheeling toward the Bone.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TEST THE CASE!

     He THROWS a handful of coins at the glass case, and purple UV BEAMS
     ARC from the glass to FRY the coins in midair.  Mac pulls a dull
     rectangle the size of a cigar box from Gin's backpack, as we
     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep BLASTING after the train at crazy speed, the four non-
     drivers with weapons at the ready...

     INT. BARRACKS LANDING

     TROOPS FILL the platform, and have spilled onto the tracks, enough
     weapons to dust Butch and Sundance.

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized
     OSCILLOSCOPE, with countless KNOBS and a SCREEN which displays
     WAVE PATTERNS.  The machine is emitting SHRILL whistling TONES
     that cut through even the siren.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB!

     Mac SPINS the dials and two overhead light bulbs BLOW.  The glass
     case housing a fire ax SHATTERS.  The Bone's case is untouched.

     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     WITH the Jeep, BOMBING around a curve to SEE the train at last.  WE
     OPEN FIRE, accelerating after the train with everything we've got,
     gravel FLYING like shrapnel, and up ahead...

     ...the train's windows BLOW OUT, the tunnel SHOWERED with glass
     fragments.  SMASH CUT...

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac JUICING the box, the deafening TONE competing with the sirens,
     the gunshots, Gin SHRIEKING as she points through a blasted-out
     window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THIRD VENT GONE!

     And the Bone's case EXPLODES, Gin WHIRLING away to protect her
     face, as we SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep now ALONGSIDE the rear platform of the train.  The driver
     fighting to hold it steady, as...

     ...the guards begin to CLAMBER over the side, GRASPING for the
     platform's rails, one goes DOWN screaming onto the tracks, but two
     MAKE IT, then a third, they BURST...

     ...INTO the train to see...

     Nothing.  Two groggy, half-conscious soldiers.  Discarded gas
     masks, oscilloscope.  No Mac.  No Gin.  And inside the shattered
     case...

     A chicken bone.  The pack-rat strikes again.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Mac and Gin FLATTENED to the side of the train above the window
     line, held fast by their magnets.  We are on the opposite side from
     the gravel path, so the train screens us from the jeep.  SHOUTING
     above the din...

                               GIN
                     THERE'S THE FOURTH!

     Up ahead an AIR VENT looms, we are HURTLING toward it.  Mac and Gin
     each free one hand, reach into their backpacks for...

                               GIN
                     OUR LAST CHANCE, THE FIFTH IS
                     AT THE BARRACKS!

     ...twin GRAPNEL GUNS, which look like big 9mm pistols, but with a
     blunt, round end.  As we STREAK toward the VENT, Gin lifts her gun,
     SHOOTS at it, a cable-attached PROJECTILE EXPLODING toward the
     target, OPENING in mid-flight to a three-pronged HOOK, which...

     ...FALLS just SHORT, the hook tumbling to CLANG on the tracks, as
     Mac...

     ...FIRES his, the projectile EXPLODING, the hook OPENING and...

     ...BITES into the wall, only four feet from the vent, its cable
     stretching back to the gun in Mac's hand, we're almost there, and
     Mac slips the pistol...

     ...INTO Gin's free hand.

                               GIN
                     WHAT ABOUT YOU?

                               MAC
                     ALLOW US A MOMENT OF CHIVALRY.

     Their eyes meet.  He sees her hesitate to abandon him.

                               MAC
                     FIRST RULE.  SAVE NUMBER ONE.

     They FLASH PAST the vent, Mac RELEASES her magnet, Gin's freed hand
     GRASPING to join the other at the pistol, as she...

     ...ROCKETS up, CATAPULTED back toward the vent by the retractable
     cable, as a RIFLE APPEARS from a window beneath us, taking aim at
     Gin, and Mac...

     KICKS it off line, the shot BOOMING, the guard almost dropping
     the weapon, then SWINGING it back UP, slamming the muzzle directly
     INTO Mac's GROIN, as Mac...

     ...GRASPS the barrel, YANKING it up, SLIPS the shot SCREAMING past
     his head, PULLING the guard half out the window to KICK his face,
     sending him DOWN to the tracks, as we CAREEN around a curve, seeing
     in distance now...

     ...the END of the line, the massive BARRACKS LANDING, the phalanx
     of TROOPS, the fifth and final AIR VENT midway between us.  Mac's
     free hand pulls out...

     ...the lone PLASMA GRENADE he kept for himself, and as we CAREEN
     toward the troops, Mac HEAVES the grenade uptrack, and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, which RIPS UP the train
     tracks, COLLAPSING a section of tunnel wall ONTO the gravel path, a
     choking CLOUD of yellow SMOKE filling the tunnel, obscuring
     everything, our train ROCKETING...

     ...TOWARD the flames, nearly AT the metal SUPPORT BEAM which runs
     vertically up to the final air vent, and as the train FLASHES PAST
     it, Mac...

     LUNGES out, SLAMMING both magnets ONTO the support beam, the
     momentum FLATTENING his body fully horizontal like a flag on a
     pole, the train PLUNGING ON without him, as guards shoot blindly
     back from the windows, the jeep PLOWING full tilt INTO the rubble
     of tunnel wall, the train...

     ...DERAILING in a terrifying CRUSH of twisted metal, screams,
     shouts, the smoke and flame everywhere, and we SNAP TO...

     REVERSE ANGLE...the soldiers' POV from the landing, SCATTERING as
     the derailed train HURTLES AT them, INTO them, chaos, until at last
     they see...

     ...above the clearing smoke, near the tunnel ceiling...

     ...Mac CLIMBING deftly up the support beam, magnets CLANKING, hand
     over hand, nearly at the vent, and the shouting troops...

     ...OPEN FIRE, bullets CHEWING UP the tunnel wall, as we SMASH CUT
     TO...

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

     Silence.  Cluttered, dimly-lit storage room.  Boxes of SHOES reach
     to the ceiling, Gucci, Bruno Magli, the good stuff.  Footsteps
     precede...

     ...a young SALESMAN, tailored, attractive.  He goes right to the
     shelf he needs.  Opens a box.  Takes it and two others.  As his
     steps recede, we PAN UP to...

     ...the ceiling.  The mesh grating, which soundlessly...

     ...slides away.  Gin DROPS lightly, twelve feet to the floor.
     Filthy from her adventure, she quickly unzips her backpack to
     remove...

     ...a sleek Halliburton case.  Opens it.  The Oracle Bone undamaged
     in its cushioned setting.  Steps returning, she is...

     ...OUT of her jumpsuit in a heartbeat, revealing a costly slip of a
     dress, kicks the jump suit under the bottom shelf, as...

     ...the young salesman APPEARS to find her peeking into a shoe box.
     He is startled.  She scowls at him, rubbing the grime from her
     face...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     There you are!  Do you know how
                     filthy this place is?

     Shows her dirty fingers as proof.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Madam, no one is supp...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I'm looking for dress pumps, I'll
                     need eight pairs.

     Oh.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Unless you're too busy to help me.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well, no, I...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Come to think of it, I need some
                     dresses for evening...

     Lifts the Halliburton case, slings her pack over her shoulder,
     strides to the doorway.  See the crowded upscale boutique...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Are you coming?

     Out she goes.  And he follows.  Maybe he's on commission.

     INT. VENT - DAY

     Mac, very much alive, somewhat the worse for wear, crawling through
     a darkened pipe on his belly, toward...

     ...a grating.  Light filters through.  Reaching the screen, he
     squints through it.  Can't see shit.  Listens.  Nothing that rises
     above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct.  He grasps the wires,
     pushes, and...

     ...FALLS straight THROUGH, tumbling ten feet to CRASH LAND in a
     heap.  HEAR feminine SCREAMS before we look up to...

     ...three young WOMEN trying on lingerie, being attended by an older
     SALESWOMAN.  The girls are half-naked and as Mac rises, one THROWS
     a red lace TEDDY in his face.  He peels it off, and still holding
     the garment, calmly tells the saleswoman...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     It's all right, the security cameras
                     behind the mirrors are working again.

     At which the customers SHRIEK, cover themselves all the more, and
     begin screaming at the poor saleswoman.  During which...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well.  If everything is in order...

     All four women.  Look at him.

     EXT. LINGERIE SHOP, SHIN KONG MALL - SUNSET

     CLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes...

     ...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once
     again landing in pieces.  It's a long day.  As Mac clears his head,
     they stand at the doorway with folded arms.  Hoping he wants some
     more.

                               MAC
                     WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN
                     BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE
                     WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY!

     The bruisers look at each other.  No habla Espanol.

     EXT. KAOHSHING HARBOR, TAIWAN - DUSK

     A super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.  A woman
     paces the deck.  Every time we see her, she seems more tightly
     wrapped.  At last...

     ...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the
     gangway, pulling from inside his coat...

     ...the red lace teddy.  He drapes it over her face, and she pulls
     it away, steps into his arms...

     ...her kiss is urgent.  Real.  HOLD on the look in her eyes.  What
     is she thinking?

     He strokes her hair, gently.  Then, goes to look into the
     Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.  As he crouches.  As he
     looks at the Bone...

     She is watching him.  An intensity to her gaze.  More feeling than
     she is comfortable with, which...

     ...disappears completely, as he turns to her.  And when he mimes
     FLINGING the case into the sea...

     She laughs.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE, HONG KONG - DAY

     CLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK,
     counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12
     HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     PAN to an AERIAL VIEW of...

     Hong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder
     streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS...

     ...billboards everywhere.  Western businesses that announce WE'LL
     STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.  Others, primarily British, sending
     farewells, gratitude for past patronage.  China-sponsored
     depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE
     COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS.

     ...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs
     advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.  Traffic beyond
     gridlock.  The human ant colony.

     ...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American
     Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG
     KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING.

     ...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.  More
     orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say
     MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese
     soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers.

     CLOSE on the square now.  A couple at a sidewalk vendor.  Mac is
     purchasing a t-shirt.  Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips
     the garment over her head.  It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I
     GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.

     He regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if
     wearing a Givenchy original.  He approves, lifts the Halliburton
     case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac...

     ...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the
     impact.  The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the
     two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE
                     YOU'RE GOING, MAN!

     No one notices, no one cares.  Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get
     involved, dear.  Mac reluctantly steps back.  The soldier glares at
     him.  Then, bends and picks up...

     ...Mac's case.  A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier
     starts off.  Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed...

     ...PISTOL, ready for action.  But keeps watching, as within a few
     yards, the soldier...

     ...stops.  Opens the case.  Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there
     in the middle of the square.  Mac and Gin watching across the
     distance, with hair-trigger keenness.  At last the soldier CLOSES
     the case...

     ...walks back to us.

                               SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I believe I took your case.

     Handing it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented
     English...

                               SOLDIER
                     21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes.

     Picks up his own case.  And is gone.

     EXT. MANSION, VICTORIA PEAK - DAY

     A vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION.
     Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.  Gin is
     driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.  As
     they pull up the crushed rock driveway...

     ...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.  Climbing from
     the car, Mac has the Halliburton case.

                               BUTLER
                     Will you please come this way?

     And leads them around the side of the house.  They walk slowly, a
     distance behind the butler, taking everything in.

                               MAC
                     I like this.

     His voice is strong, calm.  No hint of a smile.

                               GIN
                     You like wha...

                               MAC
                     Not being told what the fuck
                     we're doing.

     She looks equally serious.  Just more tense.

                               GIN
                     You're on a 'need to know' basis.
                     You'll get each step in time to
                     execute, I thought you agreed to
                     those condit...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I like your not trusting me.
                     Because it frees me to do
                     the same.

     They come upon the spacious GROUNDS behind the mansion.  A
     breathtaking view down the slope of Victoria Peak to Hong Kong and
     the harbor.  Kowloon across the water.

                               GIN
                     I trust you.  I only need to...

                               MAC
                     ...remain in control.

     They pass a towering row of perfect ROSEBUSHES.  Mac SNAPS OFF a
     giant blossom.

                               MAC
                     Which is a sign of weakness.

     And hands it to her.  Their eyes meet.

                               MAC
                     I like that, too.

     At the edge of the garden, above the commanding view, a luncheon
     TABLE has been set.  Spread with delcacies.  Two SERVANTS attend,
     also British.

     Only the host is seated.  He does not rise.

                               GIN
                     Colonel

     Col. Qiu glances up from his meal.  Green PLA uniform, absurdly
     decorated, wraparound Gautier sunglasses.  We recognize him as the
     man who took Gin's call in his Mercedes in Tienanmen Square.  The
     man who accompanied the poor Minister of Finance to the ophthal-
     mologist.

                               QIU
                     You look lovely, Ginger.  Is
                     the rose for me?

                               GIN
                     Of course.

     And leans prettily.  To fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel.

                               GIN
                     Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Hearing his real name, Mac cuts her a look.

                               GIN
                     Real names here, darling.  The
                     Colonel and I have every incentive
                     to keep each other's secrets.

     And she sits.  Close to Qiu.  Mac looks around at the property,
     the view.

                               QIU
                     Like the place, Andy?

                               MAC
                     Please.  Mr. MacDougal will do.

     The Colonel smiles.  First time.  Like an alligator.  Mac notices
     that the tablecloth is actually...

     ...a Union Jack.  He fingers the flag.

                               QIU
                     This way.  Doesn't matter if we
                     spill.

                               MAC
                     My sentiments exactly.

     He sits.

                               QIU
                     This place was a gift.  From
                     its former owner.  A Brit whose
                     business will now happily continue
                     to function.  Perhaps...even expand.

                               MAC (spreading his napkin)
                     Planning to spend much time here?

                               QIU
                     Tho it has required many sacrifices.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel has divorced his
                     wife.  To facilitate the necessary
                     entertaining of Western women.

                               QIU
                     Tho some are more entertaining
                     than others.

     And runs the back of his knuckles up the length of Gin's bare arm.

                               MAC
                     Colonel.  You are touching the woman
                     I love...

     Which brings Qiu's eyes over.  Really?

                               MAC
                     From time to time.

     And pulls up the Halliburton case.  Handing it across the table.
     As Qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it...

                               QIU
                     You're a Scot.  Would you like
                     some 25-year-old Macallan?

                               MAC
                     Sure, I'll take a case.

     Qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the
     bar trolley.  As the drinks are prepared, the Colonel studies the
     Bone.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel told his Minister
                     of Culture that he could mount
                     a surgical raid to liberate this
                     treasure from Taiwan.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  How much was the Minister
                     told the raid would cost?

                               QIU (not looking up)
                     Counting equipment, personnel,
                     bribes, an even fifty million
                     American.  All in.

                               MAC
                     Which you can now keep.

     The drinks arrive.

                               QIU
                     He would have paid twice that.
                     But my needs are modest.

     And lifts from beneath the table, a leather POUCH.

                               QIU
                     Unlike.  The woman you love.
                     From time to time.

     Drops it into Gin's lap.  She opens the pouch to reveal...

     ...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these
     are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens.
     Slightly larger than the size of a pupil.

     She slips them on.  A bright smile.

                               GIN
                     How do I look, honey?

     And Mac smiles.  In return.

                               MAC
                     Like a woman.  Of mystery.

     INT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

     Glass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the
     harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven.
     And speaking of heaven...

     ...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm,
     part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us
     PAN TO...

     ...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers,
     mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and
     somehow...

     ...tender enough.  To suggest real love.

     LATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and
     food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack
     drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles...

     This is the moment.

                               GIN
                     In the Hong Kong and Shanghai
                     Bank Building.  Is a room with
                     two computers.  One for you.
                     And one for me.

                               MAC
                     Glad I have a function, here.

                               GIN
                     The room is a vault on the 14th
                     floor.  Access codes to that room
                     are changed daily, computer pass-
                     words on the hour, but...

     But.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her.

                               GIN
                     Four men in the world.  Don't need
                     codes.  Their retinas will scan to
                     unlock everything.  One of these is
                     China's Minister of Finance.

     She lifts the goggles...

                               MAC
                     And his retinal plate is in there.

     Yep.

                               MAC
                     Our trade for the great train
                     robbery.  All right, let's say
                     we're in the door.  Now what?

     From her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle.  Opens it to
     reveal a shiny metallic DISC.

                               GIN
                     Hong Kong has a huge portion of its
                     holdings invested in foreign banks.
                     In hundreds of separate accounts...

     Holds up the metallic disc.

                               GIN
                     This CD ROM is programmed to send,
                     instantaneously, thousands of instruc-
                     tions, with all necessary confirmation
                     codes, to transfer reasonably modest
                     sums out of those accounts....

                               MAC
                     Modest.

                               GIN
                     Two or three million at a crack,
                     in odd numbers.  Total, eight
                     billion.  And change.

                               MAC
                     And you've set up a laundry.

                               GIN
                     Every wire transfer gets rocketed
                     through a series of multiple switches,
                     Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel
                     Islands, the Caymans...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Seychelles?

                               GIN (beat)
                     I left that out.

                               MAC
                     You're forgiven.

                               GIN
                     Thank you.  As soon as each deposit
                     lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere
                     else, til the Mafia couldn't find it.

                               MAC
                     But those first instructions,
                     transferring the 8 billion dollars.
                     They're recorded in the main computer.

     She waggles the disc.

                               GIN
                     Nope.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to erase the real transactions.
                     And replace them in its memory
                     with an innocuous loan coded XJ6.
                     Little homage to Limeyland, there.

                               MAC
                     Dearest.  The accounts won't
                     reconcile.

     She waggles the disc.  Again.

                               GIN
                     Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to over-report all account totals
                     forever, in the exact amounts we've
                     lifted.  So the Chinese think the
                     money's still there.

     On this one.  He has to smile.

                               MAC
                     The money.  Is still.  Missing.

                               GIN
                     Sure, the foreign banks know
                     they sent out some money.  But
                     they think Hong Kong knows it,
                     too.  And since we're leaving
                     plenty in every account...

                               MAC
                     The shit doesn't splatter.  Until
                     the first account runs dry.

     Exactly.

                               GIN
                     And then.  Comes the really
                     brilliant part of the whole
                     thing!

                               MAC
                     I was hoping there'd be one.

     He settles back.  Looks at her.

                               GIN
                     Admit it, so far you're
                     blown away.

     Well...

                               MAC
                     It does sound like the beginning
                     of a beautiful friendship.

     And his fingers reach out...

                               MAC
                     Pity it will be over.  In
                     21 hours.

     Touch her hair.  Her face.  She swallows.  A raw moment.  A
     hoarse...

                               GIN
                     Bet you say that.  To all the
                     one-night-stands.

     But he's just staring in her eyes.  The look pins her.  She can't
     wriggle off.  A murmured...

                               MAC
                     No, ma'am...

     He leans to her...

                               MAC
                     Only the best of them.

     They kiss.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE - ROUND MIDNIGHT

     CLOSE on the British Petroleum billboard, where the countdown CLOCK
     says...JUNE 30, 1997, 11:41 P.M., 0 DAYS, 0 HOURS, 18 MINUTES, 51
     SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     The square is beyond BEDLAM.  Times Square looks deserted New
     Year's Eve compared to this carnival CRUSH of humanity, rock and
     rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise.

     Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere,
     firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and
     hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless,
     going absolutely nuts.

     Who knows.  Could be the last party.  Ever.

     WHIP PAN to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass-and-
     steel headquarters of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK.

     ZOOM to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear, Gin with a
     large beaded shoulder bag.  Mac presents an invitation to a PLA
     soldier, who admits them into...

     INT. PUBLIC LOBBY, HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK

     ...a VIP party going full blast in the lobby of this truly
     breathtaking structure.  A central ATRIUM rises 47 floors, creating
     a soaring clear core, around which the offices and working spaces
     are ringed.  The view straight up is interrupted only at three
     well-spaced levels, where thick CANOPIES of glass, stitched
     together with spidery skeletons of steel, SPAN the open core.
     Mac looks up...

     ...at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium, the revelers
     have been granted access to the lower five floors.  Above these,
     all is empty.

                               MAC
                     Nice of the Colonel to provide an
                     invitation...

     She is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors d'oeuvre
     stations.  Half the celebrants seem to be armed PLA soldiers, many
     with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders.

                               GIN
                     Well, I promised him a bonus.
                     Five million.  Comes out of
                     your share.

                               MAC
                     ...long as I don't have to have
                     sex with him.

     Mac loads up on six hors d'oeuvres, piling them on a napkin, as
     she takes two flutes of champagne.  They step away from the mob
     toward a potted plant near the wall, and Mac...

     ...drops his snacks with a SPLAT.  Shit.  Bending to clean the
     mess, he slips from his waistband a flat CIRCUIT BOARD with a
     bank logo and a three-pronged plug.  In a single motion, he plugs
     it INTO a socket concealed by the pot, scoops up his canapes,
     and we CUT TO...

     INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM

     Three SECURITY OFFICERS blink, as ALL FIFTY monitor screens go
     HAYWIRE at once.  The images compressed to a blur of lines between
     a series of diagonal SLACK BARS that slash across the screens.  The
     way your TV acts when the horizontal hold goes out.  They can't
     believe it.

     Stumped, they start slamming buttons, flipping switches, jabbering
     to each other.  Now the images begin to ROLL vertically, as if in
     response to their attempts at adjustment.

     Welcome to the world of high tech.

     INT. ELEVATOR BANK

     Mac and Gin wait with a party of older Brits, who've had plenty
     to drink and are carrying more.  Two armed soldiers flank the
     elevators.  A car arrives.  As the Brits enter...

                               MAC (politely)
                     We'll take the next one.

     Waiting, calmly.  Mac smiles at a soldier.

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     What time tomorrow do the tanks
                     roll in?

     The guy LAUGHS.  An elevator arrives.  Gin sipping champagne as
     they enter.

     The doors CLOSE.  They are alone.  The panel has floors 1 through
     5 lit.  The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark.  There are NO
     numbers 11-15.

     Mac pulls from his pocket a small flat DEVICE, not much thicker
     than a credit card, with a window and a series of LED lights
     on its face.  He fits it into a SLOT beside a black glass PLATE
     on the elevator panel.  Immediately, the LEDs scramble, all RED,
     numbers FLASH across the card's window, as the device begins
     to lock on the elevator code.  In sequence, the LEDs turn GREEN,
     and...

     ...the glass plate LIGHTS, announcing in Kanji and English...ACCES
     GRANTED TO FLOORS 11, 12, 14, 15.  Mac presses the lit number 14.

     The elevator RISES.  He looks over at her.  She is tight enough
     to snap.  We can feel her heart racing from here.

                               MAC
                     So all that time, sitting at your
                     computers.  All the research, the
                     access codes your job allowed you
                     to steal, floor plans, schematics...
                     setting up all your bank accounts...

     She looks irritated.  He is smiling, gently.

                               MAC
                     Years of work, comes down to....
                               (checks his watch)
                     ...six minutes.  Don't be
                     nervous.  Easy come, easy go.

     She looks away.  The elevator stops.

                               MAC
                     Your share prob'ly works out
                     to, what?  Dollar and a quarter
                     an hour?

     Me laughs.  The door opens.  She is pissed off.

                               GIN
                     What's your point?

                               MAC (very real)
                     That I like you, Ginger.

     Now they're staring at each other.  An open elevator door.  An
     empty dim hallway.  They see only each other.

                               MAC
                     The dedication, the skill,
                     the guts...

     He holds out the crook of his arm.  As a gentleman escorts a lady.

                               MAC
                     I'm going to see you get
                     everything you deserve.

     Her eyes flicker on that.  So he grins...

                               MAC
                     Woman.  If you can't have
                     fun, right now.  You're in
                     the wrong business.

     She looks in his eyes.  Her body seems to relax, just a little.
     She takes his arm.

     INT. 14TH FLOOR

     CLOSE on a KEYPAD.  Next to it, a mirrored PLATE with two
     APERTURES, set apart the distance of human eyes.  Gin's goggled
     face DROPS into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface.  She
     fits her eyes to the apertures...

                               GIN (whispers)
                     Open.  Sesame.

     A red scanning light APPEARS.  Tracks vertically.  BEEPS.  Tracks
     horizontally.  And from somewhere...

     ...a soft CLICK.  PULL BACK now, to see...

     They stand at what seems the door to a BANK VAULT.  Round,
     gigantic, heavy steel.  Bolts eyerywhere.  Mac reaches to GRASP
     the handle, and...

     CLANG.  The door swings OPEN.  They stare at the inner sanctum...

     ...a windowless ROOM.  Dim, eerie fluorescence.  A blast of white
     noise from the elaborate air-cooling system.  Two large MAINFRAME
     COMPUTERS face each other from opposite walls, desks and work
     stations with PC monitors filling the space between.  As Mac closes
     the vault door behind them...

     ...Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe.  Pulls the high-
     resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm.  The screensaver
     displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish.  She hits a
     key.  The screen saver replaced by, WELCOME.  AUTHORIZATION MODE
     PLEASE.  Two boxes for PASSWORD and SCAN.  She hits SCAN.  A
     plastic shield RISES, revealing...

     ...the mirrored PLATE, the tiny APERTURES.  Gin leans to fit her
     goggled eyes in place.  The red scanning light.  Vertical track.
     BEEP.  Horizontal track.  And the monitor announces...WELCOME
     MINISTER FEIHONG.  Gin takes off the goggles, and...

     ...THROWS them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe.  As
     he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious CD-ROM
     into her mainframe's driver.  Watches the screen...

                               GIN
                     Uploading.  And you've got...
                     two minutes, fifty seconds.

     WITH Mac now.  Typing the words CONTROL PANEL.  The screen now
     shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a
     CLOCK in the center of the screen, labeled LOCAL TIME, and reading
     11:57:19, changing with each second that passes...

                               MAC
                     So let's see.  Across town at
                     the British Consulate...

     INTERCUT...frenzied activity in a large war room filled with
     computers, wall screens, every worker functioning at top speed...
     CONTINUE to hear Mac over this...

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...everyone is working frantically
                     to complete transactions before
                     they go off-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create a
     clock at the LEFT of the screen, labeled BRITISH TERMINAL TIME.
     It is, of course, showing the same time as the local clock.

                               MAC
                     ...then, deep in the high-tech
                     bowels of the Bank of China
                     Building, just across the square...

     INTERCUT...an even larger war room, even better staffed and
     equipped.  Everyone...doing...nothing.  Staring at blank monitors
     and wall screens.

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...the Chinese are sitting on
                     their thumbs, waiting to come
                     on-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create
     another clock at the RIGHT of the screen, labeled CHINA TERMINAL
     TIME.  Shows the same time as the other clocks.  11:58:22.

                               MAC
                     I feel for these boys.  Let's
                     give them a breather, hmmn?

     CLICKS the mouse, and the BRITISH TERMINAL TIME begins FLASHING.

                               MAC
                     We'll let the Brits go off-line
                     4 seconds early.

     As the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and Mac HITS the key four
     times, advancing the British clock to 34 seconds, four seconds
     later than the others.

                               MAC
                     And we'll give our new Chinese
                     overlords 4 extra seconds of rest
                     before they have to go on-line.

     As the local and Chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, Mac HITS the key
     four times, regressing the Chinese clock back to 36 seconds.

     We watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of
     British rule.  The British clock is 4 seconds FAST, the Chinese
     clock 4 seconds SLOW.

                               MAC
                     Playing God here, Ginger.  We've
                     created 8 seconds that do not
                     exist, anywhere but in this room.

     LOCAL TIME...11:59:00.  One minute to midnight.

                               MAC
                     8 seconds, where no one is on-line
                     but your little CD-Rom.

     He turns around.  Her eyes are waiting.  Across the room.

                               MAC
                     And when, eventually, everyone
                     discovers what transaction XJ6
                     was really about...

                               GIN
                     China will think it happened
                     before midnight.  Britain will
                     swear it happened after midnight...

                               MAC
                     They'll each be positive.  The
                     other guy.  Did it.

     Mac sighs.  This is a sad thing.

                               MAC
                     Liable to be an ugly international
                     incident.

     She squints across at his clock.

                               GIN
                     Britain off-line in 18 seconds.
                     We're bulletproof.

     His smile returns.  Bittersweet and real...

                               MAC
                     Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is
                     bulletproof.  Ever.

     The look holds.  He turns back to his screen.  She lingers on him
     for an instant.  Then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above
     her ENTER key...

                               MAC
                     Britain goes bye-bye in 6...
                     5...4...3.

     INTERCUT...The British Consulate.  All screens go DARK.  A logo
     APPEARS of a POPPING Champagne BOTTLE, whose spray forms a Union
     Jack twined with a PRC flag, everyone SHOUTS, cheers or curses, and
     we SMASH CUT...

     BACK to Gin...striking ENTER, the screen flashing TRANSACTIONS XJ6
     PROCESSING.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Jesus God, it's going through.

                               MAC (watching his clocks)
                     Hong Kong midnight, happy new year.
                     Except at China Bank.

                               GIN (to her screen)
                     C'mon, c'mon...

     Her screen flashes TRANSACTIONS XJ6 COMPLETED, hear her SHRIEK of
     ecstasy, as we...

     INTERCUT...Bank of China where dark screens suddenly LIGHT with the
     same stupid PARTY LOGO.  Only nobody cheers.  They just get to
     work.

     BACK TO the vault...

                               MAC
                     Feel like a nightcap?

     But across the way, Gin is JAMMING a button.  Again.  Again.

                               GIN
                     The CD won't come out of
                     the driver.

     Houston.  We have a problem.

                               MAC
                     Relax, don't jam it...

                               GIN (jamming it)
                     FUCKING THING!!

     He crosses the room.  She's rummaging on a nearby desk, finds a
     LETTER OPENER.

                               MAC
                     Don't panic, now, there's no rush...

                               GIN
                     We can't leave it IN THERE, it's
                     got all our accounts, everything
                     that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!

     She's fitting the letter opener INTO the narrow slot above the lid
     of the driver.

                               MAC
                     Easy with that, there's no ru...

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Every SIREN in the skyscraper is
     SHRIEKING, lights are FLASHING CRIMSON, Gin's screen says SECURITY
     BREACH in a selection of languages.

     Gin just staring at it.

                               GIN
                     There's a rush.

     The sirens are EAR-SPLITTING.  We know that elsewhere in this
     building, all hell must be breaking loose.  Gin is YANKING Mac's
     arm out of the socket...

                               GIN
                     LET'S MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU
                     WAITING F...

                               MAC
                     The disc.  Is still in there.

     Yeh.  She stares at it.  Really scared.

                               GIN
                     We can't help it, we...we've
                     gotta...

     He stares at her.  In one motion, he SNATCHES a stapler from the
     desk and SMASHES the driver with all his strength.

     It pops open.  Calmly, he plucks her CD from the tray.  She mouths
     a barely audible...

                               GIN
                     What a guy.

     But just as she's about to bolt...he holds up one hand.  Slips
     another CD from his pocket.  We see the words KENNY G.

                               MAC
                     Was wondering where to leave
                     this...

     Pops it IN the drive.  SLAMS it shut.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Time to go.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mac and Gin RUNNING full tilt through the siren BLARE, turning a
     corner to see ahead...

     ...the balcony railing, the building's empty central CORE.  Mac
     BOLTS straight TOWARD it, Gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding,
     they reach the railing, looking DOWN to see...

     Hysteria, unimaginable chaos.  Soldiers, black-tie partygoers,
     SCRAMBLING in all directions, looking to his left Mac sees...

     ...the bank of ELEVATORS, soldiers POURING in, some cars already
     RISING, fourth floor, fifth.  Now he looks directly BELOW, where...

     ...soldiers are POUNDING up the metal service staircase, the front
     rank almost at the third floor.  In the lobby, some faces look up
     to see us, but no one is shooting.

                               GIN
                     They don't know we're the
                     bad guys.

     He PLUNGES his hand into her shoulder bag...

                               MAC
                     Time they find out.

     Pulls OUT two PLASMA GRENADES, and FLINGS one toward the elevator
     cables three floors down and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, causing PANDEMONIUM in the
     lobby below, the elevator cables BLOWN AWAY, cars PLUNGING, the
     yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below,
     and Mac HURLS the second grenade...

     ...STRAIGHT DOWN and the fireball WIPES OUT the staircase, a huge
     section of ninth floor landing RAINING down on the lobby.

                               GIN
                     Okay.  How do we get down?

                               MAC
                     Down?  I never liked down.

     Grabs her hand and they RACE to the staircase, as smoke BILLOWS
     everywhere below.  UP they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest
     glass-and-spiderweb-steel CANOPY is three floors above us, the
     cacophany of SHOUTS below is like an amplified insane asylum.

     He is dragging her now, up, up, BULLETS are flying blind through
     the smoke, CHEWING up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and
     as the smoke at last clears, they have reached...

     ...the canopy floor.  They can see the army down below.  Clutching
     her hand, Mac leads her OVER the railing, ONTO the canopy itself,
     and together they RUN...

     ...straight ACROSS the heavy glass toward the far side of the
     building, like space-walking above the throng 150 feet below,
     BULLETS now TRACING their path from beneath, SLAMMING OFF the
     underside of the bulletproof canopy, Gin SHRIEKING with fright
     as they go.  We see ahead...

     ...three EXECUTIVE ELEVATORS beginning to climb the far wall.
     These are glass-enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car
     in the lead already at the tenth floor.  Mac keeps running straight
     TOWARD them.

                               GIN (out of breath)
                     WE'VE GOT ONE MORE GRENADE!

                               MAC (not)
                     SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY!

     They make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two
     floors below them.  We can see the soldiers through the glass.  Mac
     GRASPS her hand, and as the car nears our level...

                               MAC
                     You can do this.

     They LEAP across five feet of open air to...

     ...LAND squarely on the car's metal roof, Mac WRAPPING his free arm
     AROUND the cable, and UP we go.  The ant colony below us receding
     fast.

     Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified.  Mac is looking up toward
     the roof.

                               GIN
                     Okay, now what?

                               MAC (absently)
                     Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to-
                     know' basis.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm sorry.

     He looks at her.  Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid.

                               GIN
                     Turns out, I'm a screw-up.

     He doesn't smile.  Passing the third canopy.

                               MAC
                     Well.  Something to be said for
                     being self-aware.

     Looks back up.  Forty-first floor.  Six to go.

                               MAC
                     May I have the last grenade, dear.
                     It's about to rain.

     She blinks.  Huh?  So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the
     grenade, and THROWS it...

     ...STRAIGHT up.  The roof above them EXPLODES in a FIREBALL, and
     SHIELDS her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge SECTION
     of roof comes RAINING down.  We watch as it...

     ...CRASHES through the upper canopy, TONS of roof and glass
     PLUNGING to...

     ...BLAST through the middle canopy, everyone below SCRAMBLING for
     shelter, as the whole shebang...

     ...EXPLODES through the lowest canopy.  Gin can only GAPE at the
     incredible display.  Mouthing a silent WOW.

     They've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor.  Still
     climbing.  The other two elevators maybe five floors below us.

                               MAC
                     You see, banking will be more
                     democratic under China.

     She looks to him.

                               MAC
                     Well.  No more glass ceiling.

     The elevator car has STOPPED.  We are at the roof.  The soldiers
     are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out.  Above our
     heads.

     ...the last few feet of elevator cable.  And starry sky, where our
     patch of roof used to be.

                               MAC
                     How refreshing.  The night air.

     He begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable.  At the top, he
     reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof,
     GRABS it, LUNGES with his free hand, and...

     ...DANGLING 47 floors, he pulls himself UP, swings ONTO the roof.
     Reaches back down.  She is only twelve feet below him.  Frozen with
     fear.

                               GIN
                     I can't do this.

                               MAC
                     You can.  If I say so.

     She stares up at his eyes.  He smiles.

                               MAC
                     If you stay.  You'll have to pay
                     for the damage...

     She looks down at the mess below.

     And starts to climb the cable.  Not so easy in a ball gown, but the
     adrenaline is pumping.  Gets to the top.  Here's the hard part.
     One hand reaches out...

     ...GRABS his.  She lets GO.  And she is DANGLING in space.

                               MAC
                     Now that split.  Did we say
                     60-40?

     And with all his strength, hauls her up onto...

     ...the roof.  Two-thirds of it remain.  At the far edge, a gigantic
     MAINTENANCE CRANE, itself two stories high.  But between here and
     the crane...

     ...a HELICOPTER.  Big and beautifUl and empty.  She looks like
     she's seen God.  Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow
     but sees him go...

     ...straight PAST the chopper.

                               GIN
                     HEY!

     He turns back.

     She points to the copter.  It's over here.

                               MAC
                     Got the keys?

     Oh.

                               GIN
                     I thought you could...hot-wire
                     stuff?

     Guess not.

                               MAC
                     They fix those things so you
                     can't steal them...

     And keeps walking.  Toward the monster CRANE.

                               MAC
                     These, they're not so worried.

     Moving fast, he points off to his right.  Her eyes follow a
     long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof,
     attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL.

                               MAC
                     Go grab that hook.

     He reaches the crane's cab.  Turns back to see she hasn't moved.

                               MAC
                     Let me rephrase that.  Run
                     and grab that hook.  Or die...

     Got it?  She takes off running.  He hops IN the cab.  PUSHES the
     start button.  It rumbles to life.  Tests some levers...

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     SHIT!  DON'T DO THAT!

     He turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six
     feet in the AIR.  She clings to the hook with a true death grip.
     He lowers her ball to the roof.  Getting the hang of it.

                               MAC
                     This only works if you shut
                     your eyes.

     Which makes her eyes BUG OUT.

                               GIN
                     You're not gonna lower me over
                     the side.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  Now close baby
                     eyes...
                               (she won't)
                     Suit yourself.

     He THROWS a lever and the crane's arm begins to SWING in a circle,
     finally taking the ball WITH it, and as she SCREAMS, Mac...

     ...POUNCES out of the cab, RACING along the edge of the roof, NOT
     toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical Gin in a widening
     ARC, but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the
     edge, and JUST as it does, he...

     ...LEAPS aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around
     her, and they go...

     ...OVER the side, WHOOSHING DOWN in a gigantic, every-increasing
     LOOP, as the endless steel cable UNWINDS from its huge drum like a
     fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale.

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOOOOOO....

     The ride no theme park could insure, SWOOPING out ACROSS the
     skyline, DROPPING like an anvil, as the cable UNSPOOLS hundreds of
     feet, nothing but NOTHING for miles below them, Gin grabbing a
     breath to SHRIEK her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches
     its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless
     instant...

                               MAC
                     Let go NOW!!

     He YANKS her loose, and they drop...

     ...four feet.  The ball SWINGS OFF lnto space to some unknown
     mayhem.  Clutching Mac, Gin looks WAY down to the street, and
     realizes they are standing on...

     ...a rooftop.  Quiet, safe.  Alone.

                               MAC
                     Planning.

     She WHIPS around, GLARING death at his eyes.

                               MAC
                     And dumb luck.

     She COLLAPSES in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm,
     sobbing...

                               GIN
                     God, I hate you.

     He holds her tenderly.  Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Good.  I hate you, too.

     EXT. NATHAN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

     WITH Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all
     across her shoulder.  Very early, even the busiest street in the
     world is less than that at this hour.  Up ahead...

     ...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag,
     leaning casually against a pole.  Talking into a cellular.

     As she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear
     his conversation...

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...if I can't have my usual
                     suite, I'll take my business
                     to the Bristol, simple as that.

     He sees her now.  Smiles small.

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...why indeed should I be more
                     loyal to you than you've been to
                     me?  Think it over.

     SNAPS the phone shut.

                               MAC
                     You ran your calls.

     She did.  She is frankly exhilarated.

                               GIN
                     All the transactions, all the
                     transfers.  It's a miracle.

                               MAC
                     Why?  The CD erased the trans-
                     actions, all accounts seem in
                     order.  It looks like the thieves
                     were stopped in time.

     She sighs.  It is a miracle.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel says police have
                     nothing.  A man in black-tie, a
                     blonde in a gown.  The elevator
                     guards saw faces, but no mug shots
                     to ID.  I think it's over.

     Mac's smile.  Bittersweet affection.

                               MAC
                     Except it never is, really.
                     Quite.  Over.

     She smiles.  It is easy, but dazzling.  Atypically soft.

                               GIN
                     Well, one hopes not.  The Bristol,
                     huh?  In...Paris?

     Ah.

                               MAC
                     You're not going back to Mr. Cruz,
                     and the nine-to-five?

                               GIN
                     Not hardly.  I've arranged to be
                     killed in a car crash.  On Taipei.
                     Amazing how little it costs.

                               MAC
                     Well.  You want to watch those
                     pennies.

     She takes a breath.  Scared, in an excited way...

                               GIN
                     I could arrange for two.  In that
                     crash.

     His smile back.

     He looks at his watch.  Takes her hand.  Leads her to the subway
     steps.

                               MAC
                     You know, for a bitch.  You can
                     be awfully sweet.

                               GIN
                     Woman of mystery.  What do you say?
                     I like the Bristol, just fine.
                     mean, it's not the Ritz...

                               MAC
                     You know, all night I've been
                     wrestling with something...

                               GIN
                     Not the most flattering way to
                     put it.

     He takes his big tourist shopping bag.  Puts it in her hand.

                               MAC
                     I've changed your travel plans.

     They are descending now.  Into the vast underground train station.

                               GIN
                     Mine.

                               MAC
                     Instead of taking the subway to
                     the airport, you change at Jordan
                     Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that?

     Got that?

                               MAC
                     Jordan is only 90 seconds up the
                     line.  Like a wire transfer, you're
                     gone.  Vanished.

     He holds up a silencing finger.  Listen to me.

                               MAC
                     In this bag are passports,
                     tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a
                     good one.  A dress you can slip on
                     in five seconds.

     Her eyes moving over his face.  What is this?

                               MAC
                     You're on a tight connection to
                     the Trans-Siberian Express, be in
                     Europe in a week.

                               GIN
                     Mac, wh...

                               MAC
                     Shhh.  You always talk too much.

     They're at the booth.  He pays their fare.  Through the turnstiles,
     now.

                               MAC
                     Time has come to return the favor.
                     One last time.

     Smiles at her.  As they enter a tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Tell you.  What business.  I'm
                     actually in.

     And in an instant of blind panicked clarity.  She gets the whole
     thing.

                               GIN (hushed)
                     My God.  You're a cop.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     That's my girl.

     Keep walking.  People are everywhere.  But they are alone in the
     world.

                               MAC
                     See, my profession was cover,
                     too.  A notorious thief has access
                     to colleagues, their plans...

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     I've turned in...well, couple
                     hundred.  over forty years.
                     Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI...

     Looking around the tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Thought I might retire.  After you.

                               GIN
                     And all the...microchips, the
                     diamond machine...

                               MAC
                     Well, the chips were returned.
                     The machine was just a box, did
                     you actually think it was real?

     Glances at her.

                               GIN
                     I thought...everything was real.
                     Stupid girl.

     End of the tunnel in sight now.  It leads to a massive, endless
     quai.  Trains in transit.

                               GIN
                     Those were your jobs, so I could
                     have claimed entrapment.  You had
                     to wait.  For mine.

     Nearly there.  He says nothing.  Looks pretty grim.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bone...

                               MAC
                     Well, the State Department liked
                     that one.  They have more fish to
                     fry with Beijing than Taiwan.

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     So they're taking credit for
                     letting it go through.  Tho I'm
                     afraid your Colonel may be in for
                     a career disappointment.

     She stops walking.  She has to know...

                               GIN
                     And the 5 billion.

     Ah.  That.

                               MAC
                     I haven't told them.

     Gently, takes her arm.  Leads her onto the endless train platform.
     Walking slower now.

                               MAC
                     I said you hadn't revealed the
                     job.  That it wouldn't take place
                     until after the changeover.

     Down the platform they stroll.  As her eyes wander...

                               MAC
                     Don't look, they're there.

     Her breath catches.  Her eyes go down.

                               GIN
                     And my tickets.  In the shopping bag?

                               MAC
                     Well.  Kept my options open.  If
                     I give you up, they don't matter,
                     do they?

     Her heart pounding through her chest.

                               GIN
                     If.

                               MAC
                     Had lots of crazy thoughts.  One
                     was retirement.  With four billion
                     dollars.  After all, I know some
                     places where life could be private...

                               GIN
                     But you couldn't do that, huh?

     They've stopped.  Just two travellers in a strange land.  waiting
     for a train.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise.  They wouldn't be here.

     He nods.  Smiling pleasantly.

                               MAC
                     Creature of habit.  I suppose.

     We feel her adrenaline racing.

                               GIN
                     Lots.  Of thoughts, you s...

                               MAC
                     Keep smiling.  They won't move,
                     until I raise my left arm.

     And so she smiles.  As prettily as she can manage.

                               MAC
                     I thought.  Well, I've got the CD.
                     I could contact the banks, reverse
                     all the transactions...

     A train is COMING.  We HEAR it.

                               MAC
                     ...except maybe.  Leave you with...
                     oh, a hundred million, say.  To
                     tide you over.

     SEE the train.  Slowing.  Pulling in.

                               MAC
                     Then, I thought, nah.  Not my style.

     With a SHRIEK of metal.  The train PULLS toward us.

                               MAC
                     I figured.  What the hell?

     What the hell?

                               MAC
                     Let her keep the lot.

     The train STOPS.  The doors OPEN.  People come out, people go in.
     Pouring around them.  They are alone again.  The subway doors stand
     open.  Two feet away.  She looks at them...

                               MAC
                     No rush.  The doors won't close for
                     60 seconds.

     Sixty seconds.  And still smiling...

                               MAC
                     There's a pistol in the bag.  Reach
                     in slowly.  Take it out fast.  Point
                     it at my temple.

     She freezes to stone.

                               MAC
                     You can do it.  If I say you can.

     And she...DOES IT.  A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head,
     Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we...

     WHIP PAN to see.  Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close.
     They REACT, pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off.  BACK TO...
         
     Two people. Alone in the universe.

                               MAC
                     Step onto the car, keep the
                     pistol trained on my face.

     She hesitates.  Does as he says.  Passengers are screaming,
     cringing, bolting for other cars.  Our world is FROZEN.  His hands
     raised...

                               MAC
                     Seems I was wrong.

     Gentle smile.

                               MAC
                     Entrapment.  Is what robbers.
                     Do to cops, huh?

     Her eyes are flooding.  The gun is trembling.

                               MAC
                     Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the
                     shoulder, it'll slow them down.

     Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy.  Tears are on her cheeks.

                               GIN
                     Oughta shoot you in the face.

                               MAC
                     Come on, you can do it, if I sa...

                               GIN
                     No way.  Not anymore.

     She sobs.  She can't stand this.

                               MAC
                     Ten seconds, hold on.

                               GIN
                     When do I see you?

     There is no answer.  There are no words.

     The doors HISS SHUT.  She stares, training her pistol on him
     through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents,
     and the train...

     PULLS away.  An instant to pick up speed, and it ROARS into a
     tunnel.  Gone.

     Mac stands motionless as ALL HELL breaks loose around him, AGENTS
     rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly...
         
     Still staring after the train.

                               MAC
                     Airport.  Changing at Mongkok
                     Station, we can cut her off.

     Walkie-talkies WHIP out.  These guys are the same the world over.
     We begin to CRANE UP...

                               MAC
                     She might lose the wig, be looking
                     brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...

                               AGENT
                     I think Yaumatei changes for the
                     airport, and it's closer.

     Keep PULLING UP, an AERIAL VIEW now, too high to see their faces...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I think you're wrong, but cover it.
                     You got maybe four minutes.

     HIGHER still, the mob below an ant colony...

                               MAC (O.S., calmly)
                     No problem.  She's trapped.

     But as the crowd parts.  We can make out one lone man...

     Staring after.  What has gone.

               Suddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion
               you have ever heard. The buildings begin to shake, swaying wildly.
               The Bonaventure Hotel implodes, collapses inward in the thudding,

               The ruins of L.A. Rubble, smoke, a lethal wasteland. An army of
               terrifying figures climbs atop a mountain of debris. They raise
               their weapons into the night sky.

               A red line tracks along the mountainous areas surrounding the

               A Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible
               Chinese. A frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money,
               placing bets.
               
               Two men sit at either end of a long table. They are in deep
               shadows, facing each other. We only get glimpses of them: One fat.
               Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A
               cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the
               size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters.
               
               The other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of
               two six-guns in holsters. A futuristic gunfighter. The cockroach
               dashes past his fingers. WHAP! He squashes it.
               
               The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a
               dozen languages.
               
               The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in
               front of the two men. Then he leans over to...
               
               A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it
               out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues
               to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom
               into the first glass.
               
               He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and
               bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally,
               he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart
               and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the
               heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third
               glass.
               
               Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood
               is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses
               on the table between the two men.
               
               The two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues
               placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats
               above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from
               one end.
               
               The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger,
               sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light
               circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.
               
               The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes
               slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red
               liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then
               gulps it down.
               
               The crowd explodes. More bets.
               
               The salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time
               it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a
               man with an eye-patch.
               
               The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused
               between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with
               milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars.
               
               One glass left. The two men stare at it intently.
               
               The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It
               circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally
               stopping on the fat man.
               
               The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at
               the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison.
               His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws
               his hand.
               
               The crowd reacts, boos, as...
               
               The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And
               without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and
               drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops
               them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.
               
               The two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward
               the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters.
               
               Flashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand
               positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty,
               trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and
               clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day...
               
               The draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with
               gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand
               there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls
               face first into the alley, dead.
               
               The crowd goes completely ape shit as SNAKE PLISSKEN emerges from
               the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the
               money...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. Long hair. A black eye-patch. A tight-lipped
               grimace. The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism.
               The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth. A legend.
               
               PLISSKEN strolls out of the alley into the crowd. He counts his
               money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him. PLISSKEN
               stops her, pays for a pack of cigs. As she eyes him...
               
               CLOSEUP OF PLISSKEN'S ARM
               
               ... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her
               fingernail. A drop of blood appears.
               
               PLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters
               rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to
               disperse.
               
               Helicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is
               suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away...
               
               KACLANG!
               
               Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere.
               The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him
               down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside
               the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers -
               rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for
               him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK...

               A throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and

               drawbridge. Out of its black belly comes...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. A steel collar is clamped around his neck. Eight
               lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken
               down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his
               face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready
               cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is
               marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police
               Anchor as he scampers along in front of PLISSKEN, interviewing
               him.

               Celebrating cops cheer as Plissken is lead to...
               
               A SIGN ABOVE A CONCRETE BUNKER - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees
               march. Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out
               of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the
               bunker entrance.
               
               The deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps,
               thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of
               society. Single mothers carry babies. Teenage runaways huddle
               together. There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers,
               the prisoners of a massive cultural war.
               
               As Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares
               out:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               You are now entering the Deportation
               Center. You have been found guilty of
               moral crimes against the United States of
               America.
               
               A great cheer goes up from the cops as the Police Anchor conducts
               his interview...
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces, Black
               Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts.
               Youngest man ever decorated by the
               President.
               
               Plissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank.
               

               INT. SODIUM VAPOR CORRIDOR - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               A glowing, vaporous-orange corridor. More cops gather to watch
               Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation
               Center.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes,
               Plissken. The murder of an Internal
               Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank
               president. Gun fighting for profit. The
               list goes on and on...
               

               INT. CONCRETE HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Deeper into the Deportation Center. Camera tracks along the
               deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags. Plissken, the
               Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the
               dark, low concrete passageway.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You used to respect the law. Served your
               country like no man before you. Role model
               to a generation.
               
               The Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's
               face.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What happened to you, war hero? You were
               the best we had.
               
               STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Steel walls. Deeper into the Deportation Center. The deportees
               here are in worse shape. Some appear to be dead. Plissken and his
               entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded
               message...
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               You are sentenced to permanent expulsion
               beyond the borders of the U.S. You now
               have the option to repent of your sins and
               be electrocuted on the premises. If you
               elect this option, notify the Cleric
               Sergeant in your Processing Area.
               
               Plissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in
               front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men. Beyond, through
               opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into
               futuristic electric chairs.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               The whole world's watching. Every good and
               decent person who works and hard and
               follows the rules. What would say to them?
               
               Plissken's expression is blank.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What would you say to all of us who
               believed in you, who looked up to you, who
               thought you stood for right over wrong,
               good over evil? Be my guest. What do you
               have to say, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (beat)
               Call me Snake.
               
               The guards move Plissken through a doorway, and the huge steel
               doors slam shut on the Police Anchor and the camcorders.
               

               INT. CORRIDOR - PROCESSING AREA - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move
               urgently along a corridor.
               
               BRAZEN
               ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a
               database of 5 million sociopathic
               personalities. He hit the bottom of the
               curve.
               
               MALLOY
               Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can
               pull it off - not an army, not a man.
               
               BRAZEN
               Zero emotional developments. Total lack of
               compassion. A highly developed
               psychopathic instinct to survive.
               
               3RD MAN
               Let's get this over with.
               

               INT. CONCRETE CELL - NIGHT
               
               The cell door slams shut. Plissken turns around. Writ and leg
               irons. He looks around.
               
               In the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light
               above it. A watch lies on the table. Plissken shuffles over, picks
               up the watch, examines it.
               
               The cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the
               room unarmed. The door closes.
               
               Malloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light. The 3rd
               Man stays back in the shadows by the door.
               
               MALLOY
               How you doin' Plissken?
               (no reply)
               You like the watch?
               
               PLISSKEN
               You assholes didn't bring me here to give
               me this for 20 years of dedicated service.
               What'ya want?
               
               Malloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows...
               
               3RD MAN
               Get to it.
               
               Malloy raises a control unit, pushes the button. The lights go
               down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall...
               
               

               INT. PROTOTYPE DEFENSE LAB - SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
               
               From the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge.
               Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly
               areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a
               tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty,
               virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered
               dress.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of
               government officials began a tour of the
               Livermore Defense Lab. The President's
               daughter, Utopia, was among them.
               
               Plissken continues to watch the image on the wall...
               
               MALLOY
               An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to
               Washington.
               
               The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes...
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER
               
               From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the
               main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a
               black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on
               top. In the other, a machine gun.
               
               UTOPIA
               (to the camcorder)
               To the American people - it is time to
               rise up and demand the surrender of the
               President and his corrupt theocracy of
               lies and terror.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We
               scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
               
               Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy
               presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads
               out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation.
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY
               
               Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret
               service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates
               a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera.
               She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage.
               
               UTOPIA
               Today is Day One of a brand new world. The
               days of the empire are finished.
               (beat)
               To the President - my father, you know
               what this is.
               
               She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it
               at the camcorder.
               
               UTOPIA
               You know what it will do. Unless you
               abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I
               will use it - on you.
               
               CONGRESSMAN
               Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If
               something should happen -
               
               UTOPIA
               It will be in my hands - and the hands of
               my lover.
               
               She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can
               muster. The others are shocked.
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man
               I've ever known. I'm on my way to his
               arms.
               
               She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small
               hatch in the floor, scrambles down...
               
               WHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again
               standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in
               front of him.
               
               MALLOY
               Somehow during the tour, she came into
               possession of a prototype transmitting
               device. We don't know how.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia became depressed after her mother's
               suicide, began to withdraw into her
               virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up
               her own little world in cyberspace and
               stay in it for days at a time.
               (hits a button)
               Somebody else was in there with her.
               
               AN IMAGE APPEARS
               
               In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and
               sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of
               Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American
               terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a
               gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around
               him.
               
               MALLOY
               Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian
               terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang
               in L.A.
               
               Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome,
               charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to
               embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's
               on a loop. The image disappears.
               
               The lights in the cell come up.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
               then tried to erase them. She missed this
               fragment on the end of her last tape.
               Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR
               master data bank - and then went prowling
               around for innocent blood, someone
               vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely,
               looking for something to believe in.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Sad story. You got a cigarette?
               
               MALLOY
               Shut up, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's the little black box do?
               
               MALLOY
               Top secret. Only on a need to know.
               
               PLISSKEN
               And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm
               goin' to Hollywood.
               
               MALLOY
               That's right, big shot. Unless you do what
               we want you're not coming back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
               find the President's daughter, secure the
               box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm
               free?
               
               MALLOY
               That's the deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll
               like L.A.
               
               After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and
               Brazen. He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers.
               
               3RD MAN
               If you bring out the prototype, you'll
               receive a full pardon for every immoral
               act you have ever committed in the United
               States. Just like in '97. Remember New
               York, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at him)
               Who are you?
               
               MALLOY
               It's the President, for Christ's sake!
               
               PRESIDENT
               I give you my word. Put the prototype into
               my hands, and you're a free man.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I can see you're real concerned about your
               daughter.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Well, I'll think it over.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're running out of time.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I've been doin' that all my life. Might as
               well do it in L.A. Everybody else there
               is.
               
               MALLOY
               Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10
               hours to live.
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and the President turn to leave...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
               
               MALLOY
               Having second thoughts?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in
               me this time.
               
               MALLOY
               You don't understand. It's already in you.
               
               PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes
               suddenly. Her fingernail scratches his arm. He tightens.
               
               MALLOY
               The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
               undercover cop. She injected you with
               incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming
               in your bloodstream. It'll start to take
               effect in 9 hours.
               
               BRAZEN
               It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
               Genetically engineered. 100% pure death.
               Complete nervous system shutdown. You
               crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not
               a pretty sight.
               
               Plissken takes a step toward him. Malloy holds up a large
               hypodermic.
               
               MALLOY
               Of course there's an anti-toxin.
               Neutralizes the virus immediately upon
               injection.
               (beat)
               We'll give it to you, but you have to do
               us this little favor.
               
               TWO BEATS...
               
               ...and then Plissken attacks the President, hurls himself across
               the room, throwing the chain around the President's neck...
               
               Plissken passes right through the President, causing his image to
               waver slightly, then falls on his ass.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Didn't think we were that stupid, did you?
               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM
               
               The real Malloy, Brazen, and President stand in front of a laser
               camera in a small room offering a view of the cell through a
               transparent portion of the wall.
               
               MALLOY
               We're holographs.
               
               INSIDE THE CELL
               
               Plissken stares at the three images in front of him, then at the
               camera lens on the wall...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get this crap out of me.
               
               MALLOY
               I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working
               with you, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (beat)
               Call me Snake.
               

               INT. BRIEFING ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Plissken checks through various tactical survival items and
               weapons laid out on a table. Brazen watches as Malloy show shim a
               high tech submachine gun.
               
               BRAZEN
               Very sweet little weapon. Core burner.
               Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds.
               (moves on)
               Two 9mm handguns.
               (holds up a silver pill)
               Oral projectile. Mouth dart. Hold it in
               your mouth for ten seconds, the coating
               dissolves, it becomes a weapon.
               
               Malloy breaks open the silver pill. Inside is s small, lethal
               looking dart.
               
               BRAZEN
               Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several
               seconds.
               
               Plissken picks up a small, computerized compass.
               
               MALLOY
               Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted
               in her arm. You can locate her with this.
               
               Brazen hands Plissken a large black clip.
               
               BRAZEN
               This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo
               enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades.
               Blows through anything.
               
               Plissken snaps the clip onto his pistol, then unsnaps it.
               

               EXT. POLICE COMPLEX - NIGHT
               
               Plissken suits up. Submachine gun, handguns, six-guns. He, Brazen
               and Malloy walk quickly across the complex.
               
               MALLOY
               L.A. is in a constant state of warfare.
               Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
               
               BRAZEN
               Heavy Third World connections. They get
               weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers -
               everything is pumped into the island from
               the south.
               
               MALLOY
               Some areas have power - they're on line to
               San Onofre.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               As Brazen's command helicopter takes off...
               

               INT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               Plissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'll need to know more about this thing.
               
               MALLOY
               Only a handful of people are aware of its
               existence. Let's just say it's the
               ultimate defensive weapon.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Defense against what?
               
               MALLOY
               There's a war about to be declared, or
               didn't you know?
               
               Plissken shrugs.
               
               MALLOY
               Third World wants to live like we do - and
               they plan on taking what they want. The
               Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade
               Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make
               a run at the border, we got a full scale
               attack on the United States.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what does this thing do?
               
               MALLOY
               All you need to know is get it back here
               by 5 a.m.
               

               EXT. WALL - ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               The Command helicopter lands near a large access tunnel inside the
               containment wall.
               

               INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel.
               Armed guards stand at the ready. A hatch in the tunnel floor
               stands open. A ladder disappears down into the darkness.
               
               MALLOY
               (points to the open hatch)
               You're going over by submarine. One-man
               submersible. Nuclear powered.
               
               Plissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where do I put ashore?
               
               MALLOY
               Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through
               the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl.
               You should be able to pick up Utopia's
               tracer there.
               (beat)
               Once you go inside, you're on your own.
               (beat)
               You know what you have to do with the
               girl, don't you?
               (beat)
               We have to spare this nation her trial -
               for treason.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So you want me to take her out?
               (Malloy nods)
               Is that an order from the President?
               
               MALLOY
               Let's just say it's what's best for the
               country.
               
               PLISSKEN
               By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
               
               MALLOY
               A medical team will be standing by.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not you?
               
               MALLOY
               No.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Good.
               
               KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no
               damage. Malloy laughs.
               
               MALLOY
               Thought you might try that. First clip is
               filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.
               
               Malloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken.
               Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay. Below
               him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped
               like a dart. The submarine's hatch is open. Plissken climbs
               inside.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken seals the hatch behind him. He has to lie flat on his
               stomach to operate the sub. He quickly hits various switches and
               buttons, powering up the cockpit.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy and Brazen move to a surveillance-command post.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O. RADIO)
               Com check.
               
               Malloy picks up the microphone.
               
               MALLOY
               I'm here, Plissken.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken looks at the wrist watch. It ticks down ominously. Eight
               hours and counting down...
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Stand by for launch. Ignitor.
               (Plissken pushes a button)
               Fuel rod injection.
               
               Plissken pulls a lever, watches his dials. A deep humming sound
               grows louder inside the sub.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's in the green.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Lock fuel rods.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (hits a switch)
               Locked.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
               
               Plissken turns a throttle-like control with his left hand.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Out of the rear tubes of Plissken's sub comes a roaring blue glow.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               PLISSKEN
               75% power.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Hands on switches and counting.
               5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY
               
               The rear tubes roar. Suddenly the sub is shot forward through a
               long, circular tunnel.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken braces himself as the cabin lurches, vibrates with the
               force.
               

               EXT. THE WALL - NEWHALL PASS - NIGHT
               
               A door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel. In a
               roaring explosion, the sub rockets out of the tunnel, shot from
               the wall like a cannonball. The submarine is airborne for several
               seconds, then drops down, and slams into the San Fernando Sea.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken is rocked with the impact. He guides the sub with hand
               controls. In front of him on a screen is a schematic diagram of
               the underwater landscape of the San Fernando Valley.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - 405 FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               In the underwater darkness, see the broken remains of the 405
               Freeway, as the subs creams past, its nuclear wake churning in the
               water.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen and other cops follow Plissken's course on a
               gigantic computer screen.
               
               MALLOY
               Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of
               obstructions down there.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - VAN NUYS CITY HALL - NIGHT
               
               As the sub rockets past the ruins of the Van Nuys City Hall,
               barely missing it.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...
               
               Plissken ignores him, carefully maneuvering the sub with his

               EXT. UNDERWATER - THE VENTURA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               Camera follows the sub as it streaks along just above the
               submerged ruins of the Ventura Freeway. See the ghostly shapes of
               cars, trucks, busses below, smashed and overturned.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the
               freeway.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%.
               

               EXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
               
               The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a
               hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the
               Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads:
               "SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status.
               
               BRAZEN
               His reactor's starting to overheat.
               
               MALLOY
               Plissken, slow down the sub. You're
               overloading the power plant.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green,
               moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One
               the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right
               toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT
               
               The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through
               it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and
               wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed
               downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.
               
               KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the
               currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the
               Universal Studios Tour.
               
               The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future,
               passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean.
               It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a
               million pieces.
               
               The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the
               Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls -
               hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit
               through tiny cracks in the hull.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - MOVING WITH THE SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               The sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface.
               

               EXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT
               
               The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside
               with a hard thump.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide
               backwards down toward the water.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The
               sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear
               exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps
               out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up
               the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the
               sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.
               
               A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the
               antenna.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm here.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Where's the submarine? It's disappeared
               off our screens.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's history. I gotta go.
               
               Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the
               hillside when...
               
               WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying
               something huge and rounded at the ends.
               
               Plissken raises his submachine gun...
               
               ... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit.
               Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder.
               Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV.
               
               PIPELINE
               Too bad about your boat, man.
               (Plissken doesn't move)
               Supposed to be some swells out here
               tonight. Big ones.
               (beat)
               You like to surf?
               
               Realizing Pipeline is no danger, Plissken moves past him up the
               hillside.
               
               PIPELINE
               You look kinda familiar.
               (beat)
               You hang out around here much?
               
               But Plissken's moved off into the darkness.
               

               EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               Plissken reaches old Mulholland Drive, now dark and desolate.
               Shells of houses stand nearby, black and empty. It has begun to
               rain.
               
               The sound of gunfire. Plissken ducks behind a tree...
               
               Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side. Windows
               down. Guns blazing at each other. They pass Plissken, continue
               down Mulholland, ripping each other apart with gunfire. Plissken
               darts across Mulholland, down the mountainside.
               

               EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain pours down as Plissken makes his way down a steep
               incline.
               
               CRACK! A dark figure steps out from behind a tree. Plissken spins,
               submachine gun ready. It's Pipeline.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey, man. I know who you are. You're Snake
               Plissken. Man, I can't believe you're
               really here.
               
               More gunfire from above on Mulholland...
               
               PIPELINE
               Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
               
               PIPELINE
               (points)
               Down that way.
               
               Plissken starts down.
               
               PIPELINE
               Be careful. Some real strange dudes
               hangin' out there these days.
               
               Plissken continues moving, now just a blurry figure in the rain.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here,
               man?
               (as Plissken disappears)
               I heard they busted you up real good in
               Cleveland...
               

               EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way
               down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then
               stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from
               above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way
               down the hill toward him.
               
               Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward
               like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his
               feet... and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and
               sliding in the mud.
               

               EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT
               
               The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out,
               slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the
               goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the
               moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline
               when...
               
               A VOICE (SPINAL) (V.O.)
               Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise!
               
               Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of
               the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black
               duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks
               just like Charles Barkley.
               
               Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army
               of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush.
               Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in.
               
               SPINAL
               Take cover, fool.
               
               Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on
               stage, and the cross is on fire.
               
               CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the
               burning cross holding a ceremony. Next to the cross on stage, a
               hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto.
               
               Plissken reacts.
               
               SPINAL
               Let's take him.
               
               A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others
               quickly race down the hillside. He fires.
               
               THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it
               rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows
               pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...
               
               A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from
               the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his
               feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A
               hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are
               overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the
               Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts
               of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it
               starts to rain again.
               
               Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight
               continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and
               jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding
               flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As
               he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the
               rain is washing the mud off his body...
               
               AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is
               washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops.
               
               SPINAL
               Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
               
               Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind
               them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the
               rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Hey, what's going down, Snake?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm looking for somebody.
               
               SPINAL
               Who ain't?
               
               Plissken pulls out his tracer. It is blipping red, just south of
               the Bowl.
               
               SPINAL
               Say, is it true what they say about
               Cleveland, man?
               
               Plissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can
               always shift down and mojo with us
               anytime.
               

               EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped
               again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the
               distance, the sound of thumping music.
               

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is
               Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's
               like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs
               celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic.
               Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under
               the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads:
               "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES",
               "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED"
               
               One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
               
               CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER
               
               Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene
               orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a
               small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the
               air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises.
               
               HIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD
               
               ... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through,
               cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches...
               
               The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead
               a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all
               scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard.
               
               Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired
               hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least
               none that we can see.
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and
               I do some celebrating?
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's going on?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               You must be new around here.
               (beat)
               You look familiar. Have I done you before?
               
               Plissken grabs the hooker.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's happening?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang.
               Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man
               'round here tonight.
               (whispers)
               He's gonna take down the police and make
               'em kiss his fine ass.
               
               Plissken lets her go, stares...
               
               HIS POV - A CADILLAC
               
               ... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels.
               Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large
               glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of
               light and flicking them back into the night...
               
               Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And
               there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear
               and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the
               prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind
               her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa.
               
               Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along
               with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's
               moved off...
               
               Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos
               ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes,
               Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of
               the cycle, jumps on.
               
               ON THE MOTORCYCLE
               
               The Mescalito biker turns to react...
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the
               bike, hops up on the seat.
               
               KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the
               other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms
               along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan...
               

               EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT
               
               As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the
               corner.
               
               ON PLISSKEN
               
               Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains,
               iron bars, and swords in their hands. Plissken stares up ahead.
               
               HIS POV - THE CADILLAC
               
               ... is just a few feet away. Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either
               side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with
               one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and
               fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to
               the chain.
               
               Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire. He
               turns to see...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken
               swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then
               Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The
               Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own
               chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids,
               explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
               
               Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take
               aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden
               wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the
               back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other.
               They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.
               
               Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on
               horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips
               through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of
               control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the
               saddle.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for
               control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them
               around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst.
               Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the
               saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
               
               Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head,
               pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it
               mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the
               end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.
               
               THE BIKE
               
               With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off,
               jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.
               
               THE CADILLAC
               
               Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He
               swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up
               to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car
               in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...
               
               MESCALITOS
               
               Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps
               moving toward the Cadillac...
               
               SUDDENLY A HAND
               
               Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun.
               Plissken turns to snatch it back -
               
               WHEN CUERVO JONES
               
               Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken.
               
               They struggle. Cuervo raises his machete. Plissken grabs his
               wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street,
               smacks Cuervo in the face.
               
               A BOLAS-SWINGING MESCALITO
               
               Comes roaring up on his bike, throws the bolas...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him
               in the face, sending him flying...
               
               KAWHAP! Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at
               last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away
               down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's
               submachine gun.
               
               Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Later, Snake. We finish it later.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet.
               
               HIS POV - THE CARAVAN
               
               ... disappears up Sunset.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Stands alone in the deserted street. The ruins of a supermarket,
               cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate.
               
               He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie.
               After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm
               handguns, slipping them into their holsters.
               

               EXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT
               
               On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the
               darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter
               aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant
               clangs.
               
               Plissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass
               homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then
               Plissken glances at his wrist watch.
               
               CLOSE - WRIST WATCH
               
               Three hours gone.
               
               Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset...
               
               VOICE (V.O.)
               Snake Plissken, right?
               
               He spins around.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars
               sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con
               man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Wow! Snake Plissken!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a
               small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio,
               rises, walks over to Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're a star in your own right, you know
               that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How
               you doin'?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where'd they go?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Man, I'd love to have your autograph,
               Snake.
               
               He searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I've been hearing about you ever since
               that New York deal back in the 90's.
               You're one smooth operator.
               (offers pen and paper)
               Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's
               Head, one to Slasher Smith...?
               
               Plissken grabs him by the throat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man
               with the juice, Snake. Got the President's
               daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big
               doings.
               
               Plissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's
               forehead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Location.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where
               the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've
               been there, y'know.
               
               Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device
               Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Nice little gizmo you got there.
               (whispers conspiratorially)
               Look, Snake. I've got connections in this
               town. You need something, I'm your man.
               
               Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard
               toward Beverly Hills.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't
               walk through Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken's figure disappears...
               

               EXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT
               
               The old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red
               letters: "QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT"
               
               Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark
               Sunset Boulevard.
               
               

               EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now
               they are dark, ruined.
               
               CLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION
               
               As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the
               wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is
               in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored
               features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie...
               
               SENTRY
               (into walkie)
               Specimen moving west on Sunset.
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive.
               The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his
               right. He stops, stares down Sunset...
               
               HIS POV - A FIGURE
               
               Emerges from the shadows. This is the gatekeeper. Strange,
               mismatched body parts. A black-skinned arm attached to a pale
               white body. His face is unnaturally smooth - too many face lifts.
               He carries a torch.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Halt!
               (beat)
               Where are you going?
               (no reply)
               Are you here for the auction?
               
               BEHIND PLISSKEN
               
               Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with
               mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female
               body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large,
               uneven stitches. Plissken is surrounded.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Welcome to Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken raises his gun, starts to move, when suddenly a figure
               rises behind him out of the shadows...
               
               A MULTI-COLORED FLESH HAND
               
               Raises a lead pipe, brings it down hard...
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S HEAD
               
               THUNK! He goes out like a light.
               
               As Plissken slumps unconscious to the street, the figures move for
               him. Their arms lock around him, drag him away with amazing speed
               - a pack of wolves on a deer.
               
               CLOSEUP - PLISSKEN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken bolts awake, to find himself tied to a cross. It's
               lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving.
               

               EXT. RODEO DRIVE - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng
               of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters.
               Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
               
               Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts. The once
               beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles.
               Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.
               
               Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and
               Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together
               like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the
               street's center. Acrid smoke rises.
               
               The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is
               anchored in the middle of the street. Surrounding the intersection
               are patients of every size, age, sex.
               
               Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and
               planted right next to his. A beautiful girl is tied to this cross.
               This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess.
               She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around
               50.
               
               TASLIMA
               Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My
               name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Are you crazy?
               
               TASLIMA
               A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be
               dead. So are you, Snake.
               
               Plissken looks across the street. Our of the ruins of the once
               famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists
               with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding
               knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments...
               
               TASLIMA
               I can't believe I got caught.
               (sighs)
               I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang.
               Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up
               sometimes. I forget stuff.
               
               Plissken struggles with his bonds.
               
               TASLIMA
               I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took
               a wrong turn...
               (sighs again)
               Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it
               sometimes.
               
               OUT OF THE RED DOOR come more interns and nurses carrying surgical
               pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
               
               The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround
               Plissken and Taslima on the crosses. They move back to the
               sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken
               and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place
               and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their
               positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What are they?
               
               TASLIMA
               They live here, used to be like us. But
               after too many silicon implants, their
               muscles turned to jelly. The only way they
               survive is to have body parts transplanted
               over and over again.
               (whispers)
               Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills
               gets out alive.
               
               PLISSKEN
               No screamin' shit.
               
               TASLIMA
               Oh no, it's the Doctor.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               TASLIMA
               The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
               
               THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS
               
               Steps out into the street. He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk
               of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in
               Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination,
               he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work
               attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak
               through a metal box attached to his windpipe.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               
               Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd.
               He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before
               him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made
               up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               I've never seen more beautiful specimens.
               There will be no auction tonight. These
               body parts will go to those who need them
               the most.
               
               The crowd gumbles.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck.
               With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto
               his tongue, closes his mouth.
               
               The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward
               Plissken.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame
               you only have one.
               
               A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it
               in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face
               to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good
               eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.
               
               FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!
               
               WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He
               freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls
               forward.
               
               The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the
               rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!
               
               Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other
               hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off
               the step-ladder.
               
               WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time
               as the doctor hits the pavement.
               
               The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor
               lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.
               
               Snake starts to run...
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake, help me.
               
               SNAKE
               Why?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima
               follows him.
               
               Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees
               Taslima following...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't follow me.
               
               TASLIMA
               You need help.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Like hell I do.
               
               Then Plissken comes to a dead stop.
               
               HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET
               
               Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken,
               pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone
               street...
               

               EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives
               chase. They stop at another small alley between two large
               buildings.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down this way.
               
               They disappear into the small alley.
               

               EXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
               
               It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on
               either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75
               foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               This is a dead end.
               (looks at her)
               You took us into a dead end!
               
               TASLIMA
               I just thought you wanted to get away. I
               didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
               
               KACLANK! They turn...
               
               The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from
               his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...
               
               Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               He follows Taslima through the window.
               

               INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the
               balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting
               hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -
               "CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are
               wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
               
               They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
               
               TASLIMA
               Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
               these buildings.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The what?
               
               Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands
               are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw
               dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
               
               Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two
               men.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yelling)
               Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
               gun!
               
               Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor
               fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts
               three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
               
               Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good
               measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...
               

               INT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
               
               They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do we get out of here?
               
               TASLIMA
               Sewers. Come on.
               
               She pushes open the door...
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails
               rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.
               
               Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down there.
               
               Plissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by
               Plissken...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the
               sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving
               chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain
               seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and
               run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients
               overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
               
               Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird
               whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It
               gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming
               and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping
               back down the tunnel.
               
               FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
               
               An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake - what is it?
               
               PLISSKEN
               How the hell am I supposed to know? This
               is your damn city.
               
               Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -
               floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing
               larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a
               blasting, ringing sound. Music!
               
               It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
               
               From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
               
               On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an
               optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music
               blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of
               the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in
               jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat
               is hooked to his belt.
               
               He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the
               music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He
               holds the gun on them.
               
               Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO
               BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off
               the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like
               Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               What're you doing in here?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Looking to get out.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way?
               
               With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.
               Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.
               With it, he examines Plissken's face.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               You're Snake Plissken.
               
               TASLIMA
               Yes. Isn't he cool?
               
               There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.
               Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
               Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and
               footfalls of the patients gets closer...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Those damn patients are coming back. You'd
               better climb aboard.
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo
               Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only
               light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I use the eye and the music to scare em
               off. They're so whacked out, man, it works
               great. Chased a whole bunch of em right
               off the edge there a few months ago.
               
               He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the
               passage.
               
               TASLIMA
               (she peers over the side)
               How far down does it go?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Don't know - never do hear em land.
               Earthquake opened it up.
               
               The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...
               
               INSIDE THE TUNNEL
               
               Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and
               sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up
               ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
               

               INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control
               center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges
               and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered
               with dust and grime.
               
               Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,
               all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open
               fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of
               sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade
               launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked
               everywhere.
               
               The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I own this whole place. Used to work here
               in the old days. I was right in this room
               when the big one hit. What a mess. We were
               waist high in shit.
               (turns proudly to them)
               Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed
               at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought
               my whole family, my amigos, down here to
               live with me.
               
               TASLIMA
               Gun runners.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, it's a living, baby.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
               to China, take an airplane to Brazil?
               (looks at Taslima)
               Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place,
               Snake. We got our problems, sure - but
               this is paradise, man.
               
               Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to
               Plissken.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
               Explosives? I can get you a crate of
               hellfire grenades, no problem - five
               hours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               All the sewers are collapsed under Venice.
               You have to go topside. Right up there.
               
               He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the
               darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,
               carrying crates of weapons.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway.
               Just follow the signs. Get off at the
               Lincoln Exit, turn left.
               
               Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the
               ladder, followed by Taslima...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
               You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime
               at all.
               

               EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate.
               Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the
               sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in
               heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.
               
               Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I
               don't think it's such a good idea.
               
               Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeways are dangerous.
               
               He keeps walking.
               
               TASLIMA
               Goodbye, Snake.
               
               Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as
               close to 'thank you' as he gets.
               
               TASLIMA
               Sun's coming up in a few hours.
               
               She walks up to him.
               
               TASLIMA
               UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend
               who's got a place near here. We can crash
               there if you want, Snake.
               (she moves close to him)
               I'd love to take care of you. Make you
               feel good.
               
               Without an answer Plissken turns and walks away...
               

               EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and
               trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.
               
               Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past
               rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...
               
               There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old
               in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old
               illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a
               barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway,
               staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats
               stare at him through the windows.
               
               CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken. He spins, 9mm ready...
               
               It's Taslima, running to catch up with him.
               
               TASLIMA
               I changed my mind. I'm going with you,
               wherever you're going.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (gestures to the cars)
               What the hell is this?
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I know that. There are people in some of
               these cars.
               
               TASLIMA
               It's where they live. I guess after
               everything happened, they just needed to
               do what they'd always done before. During
               the daytime, they just pull down the
               shades on their windows and sleep.
               
               Plissken continues walking. Taslima catches up...
               
               TASLIMA
               What are you gonna do in Venice?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Find Cuervo Jones.
               
               TASLIMA
               No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
               
               Suddenly a shot rings out. Taslima is struck and falls. Plissken
               drops between the cars and crawls over to her.
               
               TASLIMA
               Run, Snake...They're coming.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               She touches his hand and looks at him softly.
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Taslima dies. Plissken stares at her for a moment.
               
               More shots ring out - landing very close to him.
               
               FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS
               
               From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen
               Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go. Behind them grinds
               an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun.
               Atop the truck is Delgado. He wears a flame thrower on his back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling. All around
               him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the
               Mescalitos.
               
               THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes.
               
               AS THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Roars past, firing into the vehicles on the freeway, the people
               running, screaming...
               

               EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
               
               Clawing his way through the undergrowth, Plissken bursts onto a
               side street. Behind him come the Mescalitos on foot. Plissken
               runs, firing back every step of the way...
               
               AHEAD ON THE STREET
               
               Suddenly, in the blowing mist in front of him, a car screeches
               into view. It's a perfectly restored, 1966 Cadillac convertible.
               Candy-apple red. The stereo blasts "Last Night" by the Satellites.
               
               And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hop in, Snake!
               
               THE UNDERGROWTH
               
               As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine
               gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying
               everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the
               back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie
               roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke.
               
               DELGADO
               
               Takes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH!
               
               A GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME
               
               Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down
               the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves
               around a corner...
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs
               into the front seat.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost
               burned your ass off!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is
               almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks.
               Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally,
               the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows
               down to a cruise of 70.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Too many people know where you're going,
               Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his
               men were back there waiting for you.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Delgado?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough
               hombre. You don't understand, Snake.
               Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island.
               We're on the move, man. Big time.
               

               EXT. DARK INTERSECTION - NIGHT
               
               The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old
               junked cars out of the way.
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Stop the damn car.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               No way.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said pull over.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               All right. Anything for you, Snake.
               (beat)
               Although I was going to take you to Cuervo
               Jones' place.
               
               Plissken lowers the gun.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where is it?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Right over there.
               
               He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a
               button on the steering wheel with his finger.
               
               ON THE DASHBOARD
               
               A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two-
               inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds
               rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four
               holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel
               closes up over the barrel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He
               lets me use it sometimes.
               (looks at Plissken)
               Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot
               with a fun-gun. You feel it?
               
               Plissken gulps for air.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Pure mesh, man. 100-proof artery choker.
               
               Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you
               down to one inch from death, that is
               living, man.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG
               
               Kicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated
               streets of Venice.
               
               Plissken fights desperately against the drug, but he can't move.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You should've talked to me first, Snake. I
               could've set this whole thing up. I'm
               actually Cuervo's agent, you know.
               
               As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's
               voice begins to fade...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And I'd love to represent you, too. We
               could make a bundle together. I know I
               could really help your career...I mean,
               you're a legend and all - but the last
               couple years, man, it's like you've fallen
               off the face of the earth.
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As the world crashes to black!
               
               FADE IN:
               

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL LAX - NIGHT
               
               Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity
               of the LA airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with
               the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles. The
               wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac.
               
               BEHIND IT
               
               Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former
               Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading:
               "MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL"
               
               PLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE
               
               Opens. Looks around fuzzily.
               

               INT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               He is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the
               center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by
               Mescalitos.
               
               In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment.
               Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered
               around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards
               from Carefree, Arizona.
               
               Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie
               scurries along at his side.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't
               I? All I'm asking for is what you
               promised.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               We'll see.
               
               Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake.
               Holds out a glass filled with red liquid.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Carrot juice?
               (no response)
               Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you.
               No?
               (no response)
               Your health.
               
               Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head,
               grimaces. Sweat pours down his face. He gasps for air.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts
               real bad.
               (beat)
               That's good.
               
               He kneels down next to Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Dying isn't good enough for you. You need
               pain. You'll never make it to where you
               want to go without a little pain.
               
               He stands, considers Plissken for a moment.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
               typical of American idealism. The old
               west, Snake.
               
               Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's
               beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Man against the sky. The individual.
               Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much
               in America, Snake. You remind them of what
               they used to be.
               
               Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard
               filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly,
               illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are
               being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Here is the real L.A., Snake.
               
               Plissken lifts his head to see.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The poor. The old. The lost. People
               without hope.
               
               He crosses back to Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Do you know what they want? One word.
               Liberation.
               (beat)
               They want a chance to live - before it's
               all gone. They've been hated for too long
               -
               (smiles)
               Now it's their turn.
               
               He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully
               unlocking him from the treadmill.
               
               Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet...
               
               As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed
               in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still
               carries the prototype with her.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
               Actress.
               
               Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds
               on to it.
               
               UTOPIA
               You said I could hold it.
               
               He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected.
               Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken.
               
               UTOPIA
               Who's that?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You never heard of Snake Plissken?
               
               Utopia takes a couple steps closer, squints.
               
               UTOPIA
               He doesn't look like his picture.
               (frown)
               I bet he's fake.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
               
               UTOPIA
               Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
               
               Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia.
               
               UTOPIA
               Ooww!
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Go on now. Do as I say.
               
               Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               I'm going to show her what it means to be
               a woman - for the first time in her
               pathetic little life.
               (smiles)
               Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs
               love.
               
               He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You want to hook up with us? Join the
               revolution? We're all getting out of here
               tomorrow night.
               (holds up the prototype)
               We're gonna rule the world. Come with us,
               Snake.
               
               Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish
               it later. So guess what? It's later.
               
               He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away...
               

               INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
               
               The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with
               machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken
               is hurled in. The door slams shut.
               
               Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man
               steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
               
               DELGADO
               You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
               
               Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming
               machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his
               wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just
               barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
               
               Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.
               Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and
               wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-
               CLANG!
               
               Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself
               through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick
               right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the
               machetes CLANKS to the floor...
               
               Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
               
               WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
               
               THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at
               it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.
               

               EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top
               and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by
               Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on
               those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their
               cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.
               
               Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move.
               
               TOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL
               
               It's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the
               side...
               
               PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD
               
               Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire
               dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it.
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the
               ground, takes his rifle.
               
               Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan.
               

               EXT. THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan comes rolling down Manchester, into a vast
               parking lot toward the Forum. Portions of the gigantic sports
               arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour
               into the entrances.
               
               The caravan pulls up at the Forum Club entrance. Cuervo Jones,
               Utopia, Map To The Stars Eddie and the others enter.
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Approaches, ducks behind an old junked car.
               
               THE FORUM - DAMAGED WALL
               
               Plissken sneaks up to a crumbled, broken wall of the Forum, crawls
               inside through a large crack...
               

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear
               cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,
               opens it, steps out...
               

               INT. FORUM HALLWAY - NIGHT
               
               The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy
               hallway.
               
               Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
               
               Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a
               body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is
               wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
               
               He moves forward...
               

               INT. FORUM ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Plissken peers into the main arena. A basketball game is underway.
               The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the
               other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is
               in the crowd, enjoying the game...
               
               Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The
               whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above
               his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.
               
               There's blood everywhere on the floor. The referees wear bullet-
               proof body suits and helmets. Trainers with stretchers stand by.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 5 - 4...
               
               A BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Dribbles the ball towards the basket.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand and take aim.
               
               
               THE BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air. It
               sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the
               24-second violation.
               
               The Black Muslim crowd cheers. The Korean Dragons sit down.
               Plissken watches...
               
               CUERVO JONES, UTOPIA AND THE OTHERS
               
               Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court.
               Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the
               game on his silver portable radio...
               
               THE REFEREE
               
               Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon
               dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off.
               The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off...
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1... HONK!
               
               THE KOREAN DRAGON
               
               Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24
               second violation.
               
               A whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and
               fire!
               
               BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
               
               The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets. He falls dead on
               the floor. The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body
               and hurry off the court.
               
               Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops.
               
               ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               (sound of effect of breaking
               glass)
               Shot clock!
               
               The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A."
               begins playing on the loudspeaker.
               
               The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot
               like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players,
               JAMAAL, notices Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
               Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
               
               The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand,
               thumping chests, high-fiving each other.
               
               JAMAAL
               Welcome aboard, Snake.
               
               But Plissken pays no attention. He sees:
               
               CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the
               court.
               
               CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce
               man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face.
               Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has
               a firm grip on the prototype.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The time is now. We are the strongest. If
               we go together, the others will come.
               (beat)
               We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go
               together. What do you say?
               
               Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps
               into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good,
               cold eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking
               it out in trade. I need a favor...
               
               JAMAAL
               Sure, Snake. Anything.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need to get across the court now...
               without drawing attention to myself.
               
               JAMAAL
               Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore
               thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake.
               Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's
               kick some butt!
               
               The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they
               move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               (whispers)
               You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
               
               Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end.
               
               JAMAAL
               Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
               man.
               
               The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the
               ball. The game is underway.
               
               Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover.
               They go into a set play.
               
               The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use
               slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full
               combat.
               
               The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him
               flat. No foul.
               
               Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones.
               
               UTOPIA
               It's that weird guy again.
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit...
               
               Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when
               suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands!
               
               JAMAAL
               Snake! Shot clock!
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at
               Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly...
               
               Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn
               sounds just as it leaves his hand...
               
               THE BASKET
               
               Swish. Nothing but net.
               
               The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles,
               disappointed. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen
               quickly leave. The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes
               toward one of the exits. He stops, sees...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding
               behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs
               Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake, man... Great shot!
               
               Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The
               Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him
               by the collar, drags him off toward an exit...
               

               EXT. FORUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the
               caravan of waiting vehicles. Xi-Ping has his own armada of
               vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards. Cuervo Jones pulls
               Xi-Ping aside.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               That man in black. He's very dangerous.
               
               XI-PING
               One eye?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Yes. We gotta dump him.
               
               XI-PING
               What does he want?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (glances at the prototype)
               I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I
               do not need this. I got a war to win.
               
               ANOTHER EXIT - THE FORUM
               
               As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night,
               crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start
               their engines.
               
               Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they going?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (groggy)
               Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me,
               Snake. I can help you.
               
               Plissken shoves the barrel of his pistol up against Map To The
               Stars Eddie's temple.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Bankrupt City. The Happy Kingdom.
               (beat)
               Snake, Cuervo's hooked up with Xi-Ping. He
               is primetime, man - Mister Bad News. The
               rest of the city's joining up with 'em.
               (beat)
               You're shit outta luck, Snake.
               
               Plissken reaches into a pocket, comes out with the large black
               clip, slips it on his 9mm pistol.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not yet.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I could've helped you. We coulda made a
               deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
               
               Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars
               Eddie's jaw with a WHACK! He flops unconscious on the pavement...
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels,
               moves away from the Forum toward an exit. Plissken moves after
               them, ducking behind the row of cars...
               
               FORUM EXIST
               
               The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit...
               
               Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves
               past him. He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of
               the Caddy drifts closer, he springs...
               
               And grabs on to the rear bumper. The monster wheels spin like
               huge, black scythes on either side of him. Plissken reaches under
               the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under
               the Cadillac. He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as
               the caravan pulls out onto Manchester. With the other he raises
               his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the
               front seat should be...
               
               BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the
               leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the
               driver and Xi-Ping instantly!
               
               In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to
               swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the
               seat and grabs it.
               
               Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
               BLAM!
               
               The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly
               everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face
               with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the
               Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X-
               Ping flop under the monster wheels.
               
               Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the
               opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him
               in total shock, but before he can speak...
               
               Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the
               back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side
               door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab
               Plissken...
               
               But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia
               under his arm, slides across the seat...
               
               ... and sails out of the Cadillac...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No!
               
               Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on
               top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly.
               Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the
               Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams
               into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a
               hot dog stand.
               
               ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her,
               and she fights him tooth and nail...
               
               UTOPIA
               Lemme go...!
               
               INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb,
               slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber.
               
               PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA
               
               Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood...
               and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop,
               as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the
               caravan suddenly puts on its brakes.
               
               Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic
               collision...
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac.
               
               Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole
               in the street, pries it up...
               
               Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges
               into the street, pointing at Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Kill him, kill him...!
               
               Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole
               opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The
               street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot
               lead...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets
               to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through
               the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE
               
               Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To
               The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the
               Forum...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (grins to himself)
               Good thinkin', Snake.
               
               He heads off down the street...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL
               
               Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has
               to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy
               drain away from the main tunnel...
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move
               along, slow as they come to...
               
               THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF
               
               One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our
               journey with Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop-
               off, his eye burning into her...
               
               Her feet reach the very edge.
               
               Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror.
               She gulps air in staccato bursts...
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off.
               
               He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one
               of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims...
               
               UTOPIA
               My... father sent you... didn't he?
               (beat)
               He sent you to kill me...
               
               Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights.
               
               UTOPIA
               Didn't he?
               (begins to cry)
               
               But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet
               Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares
               at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get out of here.
               
               Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said go!
               
               Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away
               down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at
               the prototype in Plissken's hand...
               
               UTOPIA
               Don't take it back. Don't give it to him.
               Please. Let me have it.
               
               Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What does this thing do?
               
               UTOPIA
               (her eyes grow wide)
               No!
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh!
               He spins, drops the prototype...
               
               ... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the
               sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
               
               Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map
               To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward...
               
               ... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor.
               
               Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He
               slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to
               raise it...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So long, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ...
               
               Plissken spins, and dives off the edge...
               
               ... down into the drop off...
               
               PLISSKEN'S BODY
               
               Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight
               to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness
               swallows him up...
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo
               Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where is he?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He jumped. Down there.
               (beat)
               He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed
               Plissken.
               
               Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below.
               Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Give it to me.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You said I could be Vice-President,
               Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (extends his hand)
               Give it.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it
               all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your
               girl back, I got it all. Just for you,
               Cuervo. Just for you.
               
               Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally
               Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the
               prototype...
               
               ... but slips on the wet floor...
               
               ... and drops the prototype with a CLANK!
               
               CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
               
               A red light comes on, blinks urgently.
               
               PROTOTYPE VOICE
               (tiny, filtered)
               I am now armed and ready for use. Use
               extreme caution. The location of the
               effected blast area can only be determined
               by the orbital position of the SatStar
               Ring.
               
               Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo
               Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a
               smile...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               This is turning out to be my lucky day.
               (stares coldly at Map To The
               Stars Eddie)
               Get this asshole outta here.
               
               Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back
               along the tunnel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait. Please...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the
               drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously,
               across the face.
               
               Utopia reacts to the stinging slap.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo...?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're my woman, you understand? You don't
               let anybody take you away from me without
               a fight.
               
               UTOPIA
               I tried...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (in her face)
               Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you
               give your life. You fight till you're
               dead. Then I forgive you.
               (screams)
               Understand?
               (shakes her)
               Understand?
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes...
               
               He shoves her down the tunnel...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Let's go.
               
               The others follow them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               As Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the
               sound of hundreds of helicopters rise.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (looks up)
               Look, baby. They're all mine.
               
               POV - THE SKY
               
               Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All
               models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood
               Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the
               blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs. They are on their way
               southeast, toward Orange County.
               

               EXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT
               
               Looking out at L.A. from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign,
               and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city.
               
               ANGLE ON THE TWIN TOWERS OF CENTURY CITY
               
               They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to
               the sky. Chopper roar overhead. A group of vagrants cluster around
               a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're
               watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The
               sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building -
               the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away. Desk,
               furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium. Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in
               urgent motion. A loudspeaker voice blares:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               Full stage battle alert. All personnel to
               battle stations.
               

               INT. HALLWAY INTO COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into
               Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert.
               
               MALLOY
               A sky full of enemy choppers on radar.
               Moving over the city to the southeast.
               
               A COM Officer rushes up to Malloy...
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander - massive vehicle and troop
               movement on the ground. All major streets
               leading to the southeast.
               
               PRESIDENT
               What're they doing?
               
               Malloy looks at the President grimly.
               
               MALLOY
               Getting ready to invade.
               
               PRESIDENT
               (beat)
               So where's Plissken?
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air...
               
               A huge blue eye opens. Looks around.
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh...
               
               DARKNESS
               
               And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long
               strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness.
               
               Plissken's eye blinks.
               
               THE DARKNESS
               
               Begins to reveal details: slimy walls. Below, a black pit of hell.
               Wind gushing.
               
               And then a light stabs across the void...
               
               CLOSE - PLISSKEN
               
               ... The light hits Plissken's good eye...
               
               The light is from inside the eye of Pendejo Bob. He stands on a
               small ledge, at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake. You okay?
               (unhooks the lariat)
               I heard gunfire down here...
               (begins to swing the rope)
               Never been down this far before...
               (swings the rope in a huge
               arc)
               Grab this.
               
               Pendejo Bob tosses the lariat. The noose flies across the pit, and
               Plissken grabs it with his good hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Now hang on.
               
               Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose, as Pendejo Bob
               jerks the line hard. Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope
               jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction...
               
               Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh...
               
               And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line
               catches, and swings against the side of the pit. He dangles with
               only his one good arm holding on to the rope.
               
               Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's
               weight. Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge
               of the pit toward the cave above...
               
               ... when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below
               Pendejo Bob. He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his
               hand, and pulls himself in...
               
               Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of
               the pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake...where are you?
               
               Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him.
               Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water. He turns on weak
               legs, back toward the pit behind him. Bleeding. Numb in one hand.
               His leg on fire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yells)
               I'm in another opening... Storm drain...
               There may be another way up to you...
               
               Plissken crawls along the drain. The sound of rushing water gets
               louder.
               
               He comes to the edge of the drain. Right below him is another
               drain filled with water rushing through it like a river.
               
               Plissken is stuck. He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward
               the pit... when suddenly everything starts shaking. Booming. It's
               a small earthquake, a pre-shock.
               
               SNAP!
               
               Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks,
               disintegrates...
               
               And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled
               suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               
               Stands silently above, listening...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Snake...
               (no reply)
               Snake!
               
               Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake.
               Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the
               vibrating storm drain...
               

               EXT. STORM DRAIN - WILSHIRE CANYON - NIGHT
               
               Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge
               opening in what appears to be a canyon wall.
               
               CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE DRAIN
               
               As an arm shoots out, clutching the edges of the drain.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled
               canyon bottom. He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his
               eye. Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg. Finally he rises
               unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings.
               He finds himself at the bottom of...
               
               THE WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Straight down Wilshire Boulevard is an enormous canyon, a river
               bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake. At least 30
               feet deep, it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and
               buildings above, off into the distance.
               
               Plissken warily glances at his watch: 1 hour 10 minutes to go.
               
               Suddenly Plissken is struck by a pair of headlights. Pipeline's
               dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom, sloshing through
               water, pulling up next to Plissken.
               
               PIPELINE
               Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great
               shot.
               (stares at him)
               You look like shit.
               
               Plissken hobbles over to the dune buggy as Pipeline gets out.
               
               PIPELINE
               You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?
               
               Pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear
               of the buggy. He lifts one down and slings it under his arm.
               
               PIPELINE
               Could be a big one comin' any minute
               now...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
               
               PIPELINE
               Long gone. You'll never catch up with him
               now, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where?
               
               PIPELINE
               Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The
               whole town's gonna be there. Things
               changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not
               the same as the old days, man.
               
               A thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on
               their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Take me there...
               
               But he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his
               knees. Pipeline stares at him.
               
               PIPELINE
               You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need
               help.
               (bends down, helps Plissken
               to his feet)
               You should talk to Hershe. She hates
               Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they
               split up.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               PIPELINE
               Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo
               Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that
               way.
               
               Pipeline points down the canyon to the east.
               
               PIPELINE
               She's connected with the Black Cowboys,
               and they don't take shit from nobody...
               
               Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts
               to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly.
               
               PIPELINE
               Yo', man. It's a big one.
               
               And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of
               the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground.
               
               Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake.
               Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in.
               
               Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon
               floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized
               chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls.
               
               And then suddenly it all stops.
               
               The booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and
               Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them
               continues to slosh about violently.
               
               PIPELINE
               Tsunami, Snake.
               
               His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the
               dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to
               Plissken.

               Surf's up big time.
               
               Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west
               behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom
               of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on
               its way...
               
               Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands.
               
               PIPELINE
               Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda
               ride.
               
               Plissken looks behind him...
               
               POV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI
               
               Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is
               a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a
               thunderclap.
               
               Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over
               to Pipeline, kneels down...
               
               PIPELINE
               Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get
               on your board till it peaks.
               
               Behind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for
               them.
               
               PIPELINE
               Don't lose it, man. You slip off your
               board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know
               what I mean?
               
               The roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon
               barrel. The tsunami is 100 feet away... 75 feet... 50 feet... 25
               feet... It rolls up right behind them...
               
               PIPELINE
               Hang on, Snake!

               YAAAAAAA!!!!
               
               THE FRONT EDGE
               
               Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off
               from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a
               cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they
               disappear under the blackness...
               
               Until suddenly Pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami, riding on
               his surfboard, arms outstretched, feet braced.
               
               And then Plissken pops up beside him, surfing clumsily on top of
               the tsunami wave, kneeling on his surfboard.
               
               They blast down Wilshire Canyon at 80 miles an hour. Plissken is
               wobbly on the surfboard, but he manages to stay on top of the
               wave. Finally, he gets the hang of it, glances over at Pipeline,
               who grins from ear to ear.
               
               PIPELINE
               Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!
               
               Plissken looks up ahead...
               
               HIS POV - MOVING THROUGH WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Five feet from street level. An old van speeds along what's left
               of Wilshire Boulevard, right on the canyon's edge. It veers around
               debris in the street, changes lanes suddenly, hell bent for
               leather.
               
               Plissken and Pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the
               tsunami sweeps them along.
               
               Now they move alongside the van and Plissken stares over...
               
               CLOSER - THE VAN
               
               Behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie, driving like a
               lunatic, his teeth bared and set, madder than shit.
               
               Plissken's eye widens, burns.

               See you later.
               
               And suddenly Plissken shifts his weight, and the surfboard tips
               and slides sideways, across the surface of the tsunami all the way
               over to the edge, right next to the van. Map To The Stars Eddie
               glances to his left...
               
               HIS POV - PLISSKEN
               
               Is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie stares in absolute horror. Plissken tips
               the board again, and slides another 5 feet closer...
               
               AS MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Jams the pedal, and the van screams forward...
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Stands up and leaps from the surfboard...
               
               For a moment he is airborne, leaping across the gap to the van...
               and slams into the side of the van. He grabs on to the roof, hangs
               on with one hand, his body whipping against the rocking, bucking
               side. Map To The Stars Eddie starts swerving, trying to throw
               Plissken off.
               

               EXT. VAN - WILSHIRE BOULEVARD
               
               The van shoots back and forth across Wilshire, Plissken dangling
               inches from the tsunami-filled canyon. Plissken pulls himself up
               and crawls onto the roof...
               
               INSIDE THE VAN
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pulls his gun, cocks it...
               
               When suddenly Plissken's hand snakes down from the roof, reaches
               in the driver's window, grabs his hair, and slams his forehead
               into the steering wheel with a THOCK!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie goes out like a light. He slumps over in
               the seat... but his foot is stuck on the accelerator.
               
               Plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand, and manages to steer
               the van from the roof. The van lurches wildly, hits a chunk of
               concrete in the street, skids, fishtailing violently from the
               impact. It smashes against the curb, screeches and bumps along
               concrete.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie's foot is bumped right off the accelerator,
               and the van slows to a wobbling, grinding stop.
               
               Plissken slowly climbs down from the roof, opens the driver's
               door, shoves Map To The Stars Eddie out of the way, and jumps in.
               

               INT. VAN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire.
               Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around.
               
               Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map
               To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Listen up. I need directions. Downtown.
               Somebody named Hershe.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Sure, Snake. No problem.
               (groggy)
               You gonna kill me?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Later.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot
               you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God,
               man.

               Cease fire with the bullshit.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks
               down, turn right.
               
               CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN
               
               Cuervo Jones' image fills the screen. He addresses the camera,
               holds the prototype in his hands.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have
               the news media standing by for my
               coronation. I'm arriving in style.
               
               PULL BACK from the TV screen to reveal we are in...
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and
               Police Personnel stare silently at their TV screens.
               
               BRAZEN
               He must be bouncing the signal from one of
               our communications satellites.
               
               PRESIDENT
               That means CableNet has already picked it
               up. This thing's going live all over the
               country.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (on the TV)
               It's a brand new day comin' up this
               morning, and I'm just so proud to be
               leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
               
               SSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static.
               
               A grim silence.
               
               MALLOY
               The prototype appears to be armed, Mr.
               President.
               (the President nods grimly)
               Shall I begin evacuation?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Does he know how to activate it?
               
               MALLOY
               Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the
               button.
               
               BRAZEN
               What about Plissken? He could still be -
               
               PRESIDENT
               Forget him. He's dead.
               
               MALLOY
               That may not be true, Mr. President.
               (beat)
               He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead
               so many times I can't count. But he never
               stays down.
               
               A long beat.
               
               MALLOY
               There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait
               for Plissken, or surrender. It's your
               decision.
               
               The President sighs heavily.
               

               EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT
               
               Jammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen
               Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the
               Big One.
               
               The van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship.
               

               INT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
               
               The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and
               Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship.
               

               INT. DECK OF SHOPS - NIGHT
               
               They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their
               glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable
               dirt.
               

               INT. LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT
               
               They enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There
               is light in the room beyond.
               

               INT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas
               jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool.
               A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over
               everything.
               
               At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy
               Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns.
               
               Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling
               face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us.
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'?
               
               The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely
               drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing
               as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice.
               
               SPINAL
               (eyes brightening)
               Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you.
               
               Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the
               transvestite.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need a favor.
               
               HERSHE
               What's in it for me?
               
               Plissken stares, a glimmer of recognition on his face.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute. I know that voice.
               (beat)
               You're Carjack Malone.
               
               HERSHE
               Not anymore.
               
               SPINAL
               You two know each other?
               
               Plissken is seething. Hershe remains calm, glacial.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You owe me. You left me holdin' everything
               back there in Cleveland.
               
               SPINAL
               (astounded)
               Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
               
               HERSHE
               I was called away on urgent business,
               Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't lie to me.
               
               HERSHE
               All right, so I made another deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I got a new deal for you.
               
               Plissken raises Map To The Stars Eddie's gun, aims it right
               between Hershe's eyes.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You help me, you live.
               
               The others tense, hands on guns.
               
               SPINAL
               I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
               
               HERSHE
               We have a little arrangement. Anything
               happens to me, you're dead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm already dead.
               
               HERSHE
               (long beat)
               I see your point. What's the favor?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at his watch)
               Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the
               Kingdom. I got one hour.
               
               HERSHE
               Dream on, blue eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Say goodnight, Carjack.
               
               Plissken cocks his gun, starts to squeeze the trigger...
               
               HERSHE
               Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
               
               SPINAL
               Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two
               armies. No one gets near him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And he's got the prototype. And the girl.
               He holds all the cards.
               
               HERSHE
               Exactly what is this prototype? What does
               it do?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You push the button, it sends a signal to
               a ring of space defense satellites.
               They're orbiting bombs. Nukes. They
               explode. Huge space burst.
               (beat)
               EMP. Electromagnetic Pulse. It happens
               instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP
               shuts down every power source below the
               satellites - instantly. All electrical
               devices, computers, cars, airplanes,
               cities. It's the dark ages again.
               
               HERSHE
               So whoever has it runs the show.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               They were gonna use it on South America,
               Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the
               United States.
               
               SPINAL
               Only Cuervo's got it now.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And that ring of satellites will be in
               position over the U.S. at 5:00 a.m. this
               morning.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do you know all this?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I used to represent the guy who invented
               it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
               
               A long silence.
               
               HERSHE
               So what's the deal, gorgeous?
               
               PLISSKEN
               We get the girl and the prototype. And we
               get out.
               
               SPINAL
               All of us?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Me too?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (stares at him hard)
               We'll see.
               
               HERSHE
               Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we
               gonna go? What's the payoff?
               
               SPINAL
               I'd like to get out but I don't have
               enough money.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The President's promised to give whoever
               helps me 1 million dollars.
               
               SPINAL
               Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of
               them.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
               
               This gets everyone's attention.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Aw, come on, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear
               to God.
               
               HERSHE
               I don't know, sounds thin to me.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones
               rules the world?

               You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin'
               things up as you go along. That's why I
               cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a
               bum like the rest of us.
               
               Smoke has begun to drift into the pool area.
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               (a soft voice)
               Use the air.
               
               They look at him.
               
               MOJO DELLASANDRO
               They're burning. Santa Anas. The night

               EXT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black
               Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary. Mojo
               Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig. The wind
               whips around them. The hillsides in the distance are on fire.
               
               They look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the
               deck. The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig. He bumps up
               and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro
               brings him back down to the decking.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I don't know about this thing.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't like it, don't come.
               
               SPINAL
               Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
               
               HERSHE
               My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you
               understand, cowboy?
               
               As Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To
               The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs
               thumping clumsily into each other. Eddie holds up that small,
               metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I got an idea, Snake.
               (shows Plissken the radio)
               This looks like the prototype, right?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah, kinda.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on
               Cuervo.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If he lets you get close enough.
               
               HERSHE
               The wind's up. Let's go.
               
               The men brace themselves. Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he
               wants to die.
               
               Hershe looks over at Plissken and grins.
               
               HERSHE
               See you in hell, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without
               me.
               
               With that Plissken launches himself off the deck, sailing out over
               open space, then down toward the street...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward. He arcs
               away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown
               skyscrapers. Behind him, one after another, the group takes off
               into the wind, diving, rising with the wind.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down
               toward the pavement below. He screams like a madman until the wind
               lifts him at the last possible second.
               

               EXT. TOPS OF SKYSCRAPERS - NIGHT
               
               The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings. A bracero
               family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a
               sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has
               been torn off. They wave to Plissken as he passes.
               
               Two floors down, someone has hooked up huge speakers and a
               croaking male voice is singing a Barbra Streisand hit to a
               background track.
               
               A beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a
               narrow girder, waving a scarf at the moon.
               
               Plissken and the others now fly in formation, like avenging bats
               through the night, except for Map To The Stars Eddie who keeps
               rising and plunging violently, barely in control.
               

               EXT. DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               An army of vehicles and people pour into Disneyland - but it's a
               Disneyland gone to hell. A huge sign reads: "THE HAPPY KINGDOM"
               
               The gates no longer exist. The overhead tram lies broken on the
               ground. Slowly vehicles drive straight inside...
               
               A battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones and a grim-looking
               Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghost-town
               square of Main Street. Ahead is the fairy castle, broken and
               crumbling, like some relic from a nightmare. Around it are the
               thrill rides, tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the
               original earthquake.
               
               Crowds are waiting. Gangs of every conceivable description. Ethic
               gangs. Female gangs. Gangs of children. Also families with
               hangers-on. As soon as the limousine appears, the crowds begin
               cheering.
               

               INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               They're simple people. They love a party.
               (turns to Utopia)
               We're gonna throw them one hell of a party
               when we get to America. Right?
               
               Utopia is silent, sullen. Cuervo raises his hand to her and she
               jumps, cowering.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Put a smile on your face.
               
               A terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
               
               As the limousine inches down Main Street, suddenly a wall of
               headlights pop on. 100 or so battered old vintage Chevys rev their
               engines, begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts.
               Gangs begin cheering, firing their weapons into the air like New
               Year's Eve.
               
               At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost an arena,
               beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters.
               
               As the limousine stops, and Cuervo Jones emerges, Utopia on his
               arm, the cheering begins, a wall of sound through the park. Three
               Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like
               headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old
               Thompson machine guns. They stop, give the right-handed power
               salute. One of them, BIVOUAC, speaks to Cuervo.
               
               BIVOUAC
               Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to the crowd, extends his arms.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Are you ready for the New World?
               
               And the loudest, longest cheer you've ever heard goes up.
               

               EXT. SKIES ABOVE DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and the group sail through the sky like silent avenging
               angels toward Disneyland below them and several miles away.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Glances at his wrist watch. Only 20 minutes left. Map To The Stars
               Eddie swings wildly over in his direction, manages to stabilize
               his glider for a few moments.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Is that what I think it is?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah. The place kept changing owners.
               Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris
               killed 'em.
               
               Hershe and Spinal sweep over next to Plissken and fly in close
               formation.
               
               HERSHE
               Snake. We need some kind of diversion.
               
               A beat later all of them look over at Map To The Stars Eddie.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - THE ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones leads Utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in
               front of all the others. The choppers are all starting up,
               roaring, blades turning.
               
               Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map
               To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes
               Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it! I made it!
               Wait for me...
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food
               restaurant - KACRUNCH!
               
               A beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey Cuervo...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Bivouac.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Would you please kill him for me?
               
               BIVOUAC
               My pleasure.
               
               Bivouac raises his machine gun...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait! I got news. There's about to
               be an attack.
               
               Cuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac. Everyone tenses. Map
               To The Stars Eddie races over...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's
               Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You told me he was dead.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I thought he was, but he came back.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where?
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath,
               looking like he may faint...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Oh Cuervo...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (long beat)
               What?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (stalling)
               It's so good to see you again.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where's Plissken?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He's... near.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're stalling, Eddie.
               (grabs him)
               Talk, you little gringo!
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (eyes wide)
               Cuervo, look out behind you!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him,
               and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand.
               At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an
               old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and
               grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You've lied to me for the very last time.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The
               Stars Eddie's face...
               
               KABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street.
               
               WHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys
               dive right down across Main Street.
               
               KABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover.
               
               Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it...
               
               BLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere!
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead
               helicopter when...
               
               Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo,
               Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap.
               
               SERIES OF FAST CUTS:
               
               Chaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping
               hellfire from his automatic rifle.
               
               People running. Explosions.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia.
               
               Plissken and Cuervo Jones get to their feet and have at it!
               
               Through flames and running people Plissken and Cuervo battle.
               
               In Cuervo's hand is a long black knife. Just as he's plunging it,
               Plissken steps aside and grabs him. Locked together, they battle
               savagely.
               
               The knife cuts Plissken's chest.
               
               Cuervo moves for Plissken's throat.
               
               Plissken smashes him in the face.
               
               They both grip the knife in a deadlock.
               
               From above, Spinal dives down and hurls a grenade. Cuervo and
               Plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the
               grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby.
               
               When the smoke clears, three things are on the ground. Plissken.
               Cuervo Jones. The prototype.
               
               Instantly Plissken and Cuervo dive for the prototype. Plissken has
               it, kicks Cuervo in the face, drags himself to his feet and takes
               off running (as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg)
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drags Utopia toward the lead helicopter, as
               Hershe comes in for a landing.
               
               Spinal comes in for a landing, continues to throw grenades. The
               other Black Cowboys land, provide covering fire.
               
               Plissken races for the chopper. Behind him, Cuervo Jones is on his
               feet and in pursuit.
               
               Hershe opens fire at Cuervo. Cuervo dives behind a smoking,
               burning Chevy.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT
               
               As everyone scrambles in. A Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides
               down the bulkhead and out the door.
               
               Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls. Utopia and
               Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together. The
               others are in the back, firing back at the gangs. Plissken pulls
               in power.
               
               CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE

               EXT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The lead chopper shudders, trying to get off the ground. Gunfire
               continues.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER
               
               The ship shakes violently.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
               
               HERSHE
               (screams from the rear
               compartment)
               Somebody get off!
               
               SPINAL
               (glares at him)
               Who?
               
               All eyes quickly move to Map To The Stars Eddie...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Bullets rip through the windscreen.

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The ship trembles. Plissken moves his feet, jams in the left tail-
               rotor pedal all the way.
               

               EXT. THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               Rotates, turns around 180 degrees on the ground, pushed by the
               tail rotor force.
               
               THE CYCLIC CONTROL
               
               As Plissken inches it forward...
               
               THE HELICOPTER
               
               Begins sliding across the ground, skids grinding along the
               pavement, sparks flying - slowly at first, now picking up speed...
               
               In the cockpit, the ship lurches and jumps and slams! Everyone is
               bounced around.
               
               The helicopter moves fast now - faster -
               
               LOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS
               
               As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a
               foot -
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other
               gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper...
               
               THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               As it lifts - five feet - climbing...
               
               The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's
               sprinting figure.
               
               POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
               
               See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans
               out the door.
               
               HERSHE
               We're not gonna make it over the fuckin'
               mountain!
               
               The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15
               feet... 10... Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way... 8
               feet... 5...
               
               The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right
               skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound,
               and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging
               half off the ship!
               
               On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting
               helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off
               into the sky. Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               An alarm horn sounds. Everyone is on the move.
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               A crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving
               over a grid of L.A.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's
               passed into restricted space, heading this
               way.
               
               Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Is it Plissken?
               
               Nobody knows.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander, I'm getting radio contact with
               the aircraft.
               
               MALLOY
               Boost it.
               
               The COM Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice
               booming through HQ.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O.)
               Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Thank God.
               
               MALLOY
               (grabs a radio mike)
               Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the
               prototype?
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               PLISSKEN
               (into his radio)
               Yeah, I got it.
               
               Plissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in
               his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               PLISSKE
               (to Map To The Stars Eddie)
               Now give me the real one.
               
               Utopia stares into Plissken's eye.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't
               have it.
               
               Suddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and
               pulls out the real prototype. She hands it to Plissken
               
               UTOPIA
               Now we're even, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks
               him in the face. His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment,
               then he slumps in the seat.
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Malloy set up in the staging area for landing.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander Malloy - he's got lots of
               company.
               
               Malloy and the others look at the computer screen. Plissken's
               green blip is followed by hundreds of other green blips all
               rapidly closing in on him...
               
               MALLOY
               Battle stations...
               
               The room springs into action...
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               PLISSKEN
               I think we've burned off enough fuel. We
               may be lighter enough to hover. Just
               barely.
               
               HERSHE
               Can you land?
               
               PLISSKEN
               No. The right skid's broken. If I try to
               set it down she'll crash. I have to stay
               in a hoverwhile you jump off.
               (beat as Plissken looks at
               Utopia)
               Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give
               her your dress.
               
               HERSHE
               (ice cold)
               My name is no longer Carjack. Will you
               please get that through your fucking head?
               
               SPINAL
               Holy shit.
               
               They look, as suddenly the night sky on either side of them is
               filled with gang helicopters!
               

               EXT. SKY OVER THE SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT
               
               The lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers. Above, below,
               on either side.
               
               Right next to Plissken, Cuervo's chopper pulls up just ten feet
               away. Cuervo grins out at Plissken evilly, unhooks himself from
               his seat...
               
               On the other side, another chopper with Bivouac and the Black
               Muslims pull up. In the rear compartment, a Black Muslim aims what
               looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor.
               
               KAWHAM!
               
               The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the
               side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding. In the
               lead helicopter, the Black Cowboys, Spinal and Hershe aim their
               weapons.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't shoot! They can drag us down into
               the sea.
               
               Cuervo Jones leaps from the opened door of his chopper, flies
               through space, lands on Plissken's door with a WHUMP! He smashes
               through the side window and grabs Plissken.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! Gang choppers open fire, riddling the rear
               compartment with bullets. Spinal and several Black Cowboys are
               hit!
               
               Plissken fights Cuervo through the door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (to Utopia)
               Take the controls!
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               UTOPIA
               What do I do?
               
               But Cuervo wrenches the door open, grabs Plissken, and pulls him
               out of the seat. Utopia grabs the controls.
               
               The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping.
               Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the
               doorway, one foot in, one foot out.
               
               Plissken embraces Cuervo and throws them both over the edge...
               
               They fall through space, locked together, until...
               
               WHAP! They are jolted to a dead stop, swinging in mid-air,
               Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid.
               
               The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and
               Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and
               forth by the helicopter's gyrations.
               
               In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls. The ship is shaking,
               swinging like a pendulum. Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the
               rear compartment. Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains
               consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Where's Plissken?
               
               Outside, Cuervo clutches Plissken around the neck, struggling and
               thrashing. Plissken head butts him, dazing him for a second...
               
               KA-CRACK! The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on
               the helicopter above. Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at
               each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid,
               climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race...
               
               Both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the
               left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the
               San Fernando Sea. Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other. Plissken
               slides away from him, looks up... sees the grappling hook stuck
               into the side of the helicopter...
               
               Plissken swings up, straddling the skid. He reaches up and begins
               prying loose the grappling hook. Cuervo's coming right up behind
               him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands. He raises the
               knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door,
               lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Cuervo.
               
               Cuervo looks at him, starts to say something, eyes bulging...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               If you get to America - let's do lunch.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! The shots hit, and Cuervo buckles, falls backwards
               off the skid, plunging downward toward the surface of the San
               Fernando Sea... KASPLASH!
               
               Plissken rips out the grappling hook...
               
               AS BOOM!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the
               seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the
               water below.
               
               Plissken jumps back inside the cockpit.
               
               UTOPIA
               Snake, look.
               
               POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
               
               Police battle helicopters thunder toward them. In unison, the
               police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms.
               Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness
               and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is
               filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming
               wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water.
               
               It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships
               circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and
               rockets spitting blue-white fire. The pound the living hell out of
               the enemy choppers. In f.g. Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the
               wall.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President, Brazen and the rest the Firebase watch as
               Plissken's helicopter approaches, then zooms right over Rotor City
               and heads for the distant treeline.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Where the hell is he going?
               

               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT
               
               Plissken's helicopter comes in, lower and lower, into a hover five
               feet above the ground. Inside, Plissken pulls in all the power
               he's got.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's taking all the power we've got to
               hover.
               
               CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE
               
               Shows 100% plus power. The helicopter is in a trembling hover.
               Inside...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Jump out. Head for the treeline and
               disappear.
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               Utopia jumps out of the helicopter... lands on the ground and
               takes off running into the darkness. Inside...
               
               PLISSKEN
               All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me.
               We're gonna land.
               
               Plissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets
               down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll.
               Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the
               blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild. The fuselage jumps
               and twists in a grinding fury. Smoke and debris fly. The blades
               snap off...
               
               FROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE
               
               Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen,
               barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered
               with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part
               of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into
               flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank. Fire billows into
               the cockpit, engulfing Plissken...
               
               Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire.
               Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the
               flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball.
               
               Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded...
               
               ... as Malloy, the President, Brazen, and a squad of police arrive
               in vehicles. They slowly get out...
               
               ... as Plissken limps toward them...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where's the anti-toxin...?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Give me the prototype.
               
               Plissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President.
               
               MALLOY
               Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real
               one.
               
               Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To
               The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real
               prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken
               glances at it lying on the ground.
               
               Nobody moves. Plissken looks at their faces.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Give me the goddamn shot!
               
               Suddenly everyone begins to smirk. A couple cops laugh.
               
               MALLOY
               It was all a fake, Plissken.
               
               Plissken stares at him. More laughter.
               
               BRAZEN
               You were injected with glucose. There is
               no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going
               to die - at least not from anything we
               gave you.
               
               MALLOY
               C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's
               phony, you know that.
               
               Plissken moves toward the President, stops inches away.
               
               MALLOY
               Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride,
               and you came through. Not bad for a
               dirtbag like you.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're free, Plissken. But if you even so
               much as break wind on a country road I'll
               crush you like a bug.
               
               The President glares at Plissken, turns, walks away.
               
               COP (O.S.)
               Commander...
               (Malloy looks at him)
               Look what we found.
               
               Across the clearing come two policemen dragging Utopia along with
               them. They bring her up in front of Malloy. Utopia glances at
               Plissken.
               
               MALLOY
               You didn't finish the mission, Plissken.
               We'll have to do that for you.
               
               Plissken, Malloy and Brazen watch as Utopia is taken away. Finally
               Plissken turns to Malloy.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Got a smoke?
               
               MALLOY
               You're gonna have to learn to respect the
               law, Snake. The United States is a no-
               smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking,
               do drugs, no women unless you're married,
               no guns, no foul language. It's a brand
               new day for you, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The name's Plissken.
               
               Plissken walks away. Follow his feet as they stop next to the
               prototype lying in the grass...
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Utopia is being strapped into an electric chair by her police
               guards. The guards step back from Utopia. One of them walks over
               to a huge switch on the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               TRACKING SHOT WITH PLISSKEN
               
               He holds the real prototype, calmly pushes the button.
               

               EXT. SPACE - DAWN
               
               The ring of space satellites hover silently above the Earth. See
               the United States, North America below, as a beautiful sunrise is
               beginning.
               
               Suddenly the satellites explode into white...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               As the sky is lit white. Malloy, Brazen, and the cops look up. All
               vehicles stop. Lights out. Sounds of motors running down.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - DAWN
               
               Darkness. No power. Everyone looks around. Utopia smiles.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The daylight is coming as police helicopters fall from the sky,
               crashing. Panic. Policemen run everywhere. A duty sergeant races
               up to Malloy...
               
               DUTY SERGEANT
               We're being attacked, Commander. The north
               wall.
               

               EXT. WALL - DAWN
               
               All of L.A. has arrive at the wall in boats. Gangs lean ladders,
               use ropes and hooks - they scale the wall. Pendejo Bob leads the
               charge. Pipeline is right behind him.
               

               EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - DAWN
               
               Gunfire. A pitched battle as cops try to repel the horde of L.A.
               invaders as they pour over the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The Firebase is overrun by invaders. Hand-to-hand combat. World
               War III has begun. Panicked cops race for the trees, abandoning
               their positions.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The Third World warriors free Utopia from the electric chair. She
               joins them as they swarm through the halls...
               

               EXT. HILLSIDE - FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               Plissken is at the edge of the Firebase, moving out into the
               hillside. Camera tracks with him towards the rising sun.
               
               A smile crosses Plissken's face. He tosses the prototype down a
               ravine, and walks away into the sunrise.
               
               FADE OUT
               
               THE END

FADE OUT 1997

EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY SECURITY CONTROL -- NIGHT.
A Jeep pulls up outside the base.  It comes to a stop and the driver
pulls out a walkie-talkie.

DRIVER
This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.  I have an escape in progress.
An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall.

TILT UP -- WALL
EXT. CLOSE UP -- SIGN "New York Maximum Security Penitentiary Manhattan
Island"

CONTINUED TILT UP -- EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
Two guards watch for the escapees in question.

EXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND -- NIGHT
A helicopter flies over the bay towards Manhattan Island.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The two escapees paddle, trying to get across the bay.

EXT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The search light WHITES OUT THE SCREEN

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The two escapees continue paddling.  THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT.

HELICOPTER PILOT
You have 10 seconds.  Turn around.  Start back to the island.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The pilot targets the boat on a computer screen in front of him.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
Two shots are fired directly in front of the escapees as a warning.
They ignore them and continue paddling away from the island.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP -- PILOT'S HAND
The pilot FIRES AGAIN.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The boat EXPLODES.

EXT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
Following the helicopter as it returns to the base.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme walks back to the main base, pulling out his walkie-talkie on the
way.

REHME
Gotham 4, confirm the kill.

HELICOPTER PILOT
Circled the base.  Over.

REHME
Security, this is Rehme.  We have confirmation from Gotham 4.  We have a
kill in midharbor.  South of the battery.  Two in the water dead.

SECURITY
Two confirmed.

REHME
Very well.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme walks into a building labeled "LIBERTY ISLAND SECURITY CONTROL and
picks up a phone.

REHME
Air traffic, this is Rehme . . .

EXT. AIR TRAFFIC -- NIGHT
The helicopter lands.  In the background, a BUS FULL OF PRISONERS comes
up.

EXT. BUS -- NIGHT
S.D. "SNAKE" PLISSKEN gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by
three guards into the base.  He looks like the essence of cool.  His
hair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the
line, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on.  He's wearing a black
spandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair
of camouflage pants with lots of pockets.  His jacket is a brown leather
jacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of
handcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight
metal bar between them.  He's not resisting anything, but the police are
not taking any chances.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main
floor.

VOICE
Attention.  You are now entering the debarkation area.  No talking.  No
smoking.   The next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours.
You now have the option to terminate and be cremated on the premises.
If you elect this option, notify the duty sergeant in your processing
area.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP ON SIGN -- "No talking.  No smoking.  Follow the ORANGE
line."
EXT. CLOSE UP ON SNAKE.  He is not impressed.
STEADICAM VIEW OF THE HALL, SNAKE'S P.O.V. Guards, guards, more guards.
Who cares.

As Snake rounds the corner:

O.S. GUARD
Hold it.

Snake stops, turns, directs an impertinent glance at the speaker.  He's
still not impressed by any of this.

FADE OUT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADE IN.
EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme waits as a limo pulls up.  Out steps BOB HAUK.

REHME
We've got a small jet in trouble, over restricted air space.

HAUK
Where is it?

REHME
Seven miles out and closing.

The two of them walk AWAY.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk and Rehme walk down the stairs.  They turn TOWARD US and walk into
the AIR TRAFFIC ROOM.  Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission
screens, wearing headsets and working.   Following Hauk and Rehme into
the room:

INT. AIR TRAFFIC ROOM -- NIGHT

REHME
We've been on the board for the last twenty minutes.  We haven't been
able to reach them.  There was a transmission ten minutes ago.  He
identified as "David 14."  Then all of a sudden he was cut off.

Hauk and Rehme stand behind a CONTROLLER.

CONTROLLER
David 14, acknowledge.  David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.  Squawk
7700, contact on 121.5.
(to Hauk and Rehme)
There's still no reply.
(to his headset)
Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space.

O.S. CONTROLLER
New York, I have it.

Hauk pulls Rehme aside.

HAUK
Who is it?

REHME
I don't know.

HAUK
You have the code?

REHME
There's no David 14 on the computer.

HAUK
Unlisted?

REHME
Unregistered code.  We telexed Washington.  Still waiting for a reply.

CONTROLLER
I think I've got him, sir.

Hauk and Rehme walk back over to the controller.  He patches a voice-
over through.

REBEL VOICE
It's too late, assholes.  All your imperialist weapons and lies can't
save him now.  We're going down.  We're going to crash.

CONTROLLER
David 14, acknowledge!

CODEMAN
The code's coming in, sir.

Hauk and Rehme dash over to the codeman.  He shows them a display.
"Aircraft Identified.  Code: David14.  Decode: AIR FORCE ONE."

"Air Force One" blinks as Hauk and Rehme look at each other in shock.

EXT. PLANE -- NIGHT
The plane is flying over New York.

INT. COCKPIT -- NIGHT
The REBEL has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own.

REBEL
Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . . .

She pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read.

REBEL
We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the
name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country
have struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick!

INT. PLANE -- NIGHT
A secret service AGENT taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel
continues.

REBEL
What better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in
the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison?

The agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers.

AGENT
(to 2ND AGENT)
Unlock the pod!

2ND AGENT immediately runs off.

PAN LEFT TO PRESIDENT.

AGENT
She's bolted the door.

PRESIDENT
Can't you shoot off the lock?

AGENT
No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.

PRESIDENT
How about lifting the door off of the hinges?

AGENT
No, sir.

EXT. CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to
it.

PRESIDENT
Get me to the pod.

The President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the
plane.

INT. POD ROOM -- NIGHT
The pod opens.  An expert attaches a locating device to the President's
wrist.

EXPERT
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from
the pod.  I'm activating it now.

SCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod.
He pushes a few buttons.

PRESIDENT
God save me and watch over you all.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
A guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme and Hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane.

VOICE
Computer simulation tracking Air Force One.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The plane goes down.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP -- MONITORS
As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the
building.  It's the pod.

O.S. MAN
It's down!

HAUK
It's the escape pod.

REHME
40 degrees, 50 yards from impact.

HAUK
I'm going in.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Helicopters prepare for, and execute, launch, and fly into New York.  A
guard watches them.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme watches monitors as Hauk talks.

HAUK
1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.  We're moving down.  Direct sight ahead.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The helicopters land.  A swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs
back.  He follows with a second swarm.  The first swarm assumes a
defensive position near the pod.  Hauk examines the pod.  It's
definitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames.

An odd LAUGH from nowhere.

WEIRDO walks out of the darkness.  He nods his head to Hauk.

WEIRDO
You touch me... he dies.  If you're not in the air in thirty seconds...
he dies.  You come back in... he dies.

Weirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the
President's middle finger, complete with ring.

WEIRDO
Twenty seconds.

HAUK
I'm ready to talk.

WEIRDO
Nineteen.  Eighteen.

HAUK
What do you want?

WEIRDO
Seventeen.  Sixteen.

HAUK
Let's go.  Let's go!

Weirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the
helicopters and hauls ass out of New York.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone.  Hauk is in the
foreground, looking pensive.

REHME
Yes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.

Hauk picks up a phone.

HAUK
This is Bob Hauk.  ...We can't.  If we move in with choppers, they'll
kill him.  We're lucky if he's not dead already... They don't want
anything yet.  By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too
late.

REHME
Tell him we have to go with your plan now.

Hauk waves him off.

HAUK
We can't wait until tomorrow.  If we have to move in and take the
island, it's a last resort.  It's 8:45.  I want permission to try a
rescue.  Thank you.

INT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol.  He looks up from his desk.

HAUK
All right.

OVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD
He's dangerous, sir.

HAUK
(with quiet confidence)
I know.  I'll be OK.

HAUK'S P.O.V.
We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure.  It's Snake Plissken
all right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks into
Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raises
his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," but
he doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head.

HAUK
I'm not a fool, Plissken.

SNAKE
(coooooool)
Call me Snake.

Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.

HAUK
S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.
Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decorated
by the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Life
sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your
ass out of the world, War Hero.

Snake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffed
right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand,
strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.  He lets out a
calm breath and says:

SNAKE
Who are you?

HAUK
Hauk.  Police Commissioner.

SNAKE
Bob Hauk...

HAUK
Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.  We heard of you, too, Plissken.

SNAKE
Why are we talking?

HAUK
I have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
act committed in the United States.

Hauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is something
he wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it.

HAUK
(pressing his advantage)
There was an accident about an hour ago.  A small jet went down inside
New York City.  The President was on board.

SNAKE
(re-establishing control over the conversation)
President of what?

HAUK
That's not funny, Plissken.  (beat)  You go in, find the President and
bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.

We sense amusement from Snake.  This is not the first time the
government has asked him for a favor.  But he's not a soldier or a "War
Hero" anymore.  He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon.
He's holding the cards now, and he knows it.

SNAKE
Twenty-four hours, huh?

HAUK
I'm making you an offer.

SNAKE
Bullshit.

HAUK
Straight just like I said.

SNAKE
I'll think about it.

HAUK
No time.  Give me an answer.

Snake turns away.  Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined
to be in the driver's seat.

SNAKE
Get a new president.

HAUK
We're still at war, Plissken.  We need him alive.

SNAKE
I don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.

HAUK
Is that your answer?

SNAKE
I'm thinking about it.

HAUK
Think hard.

Snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette.  Next question:

SNAKE
Why me?

HAUK
You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.  You know how to get in quiet.
You're all I've got.

SNAKE
I guess I go in one way or the other.  Doesn't mean shit to me.  Give me
the paper.

HAUK
When you come out.

SNAKE
Before.

HAUK
I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.

SNAKE
Call me Snake.

INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT
Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns,
a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a
Uzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a cool
expression.

REHME
Some of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind and
converted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline source
in there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areas
have streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete control
of the underground.  They're night raiders.

Snake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  He
picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.

HAUK
Tracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we can
track you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  A
safety catch.

Snake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's the
button.  This is familiar.  He smiles.

INT. HALL -- NIGHT
Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down the
hall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared.

SNAKE
Where am I landing?

HAUK
Top of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't see
it, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's a
service elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate the
prison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down to
fifty.  From there on down
you walk.

Snake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his
authority, and it's not working very well.

HAUK
You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.
It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.

He hands Snake a homing device.

HAUK
Homing device.  Shows directions and distance.

INT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
Snake and Hauk walk into the room.  They're met by a young medic.

HAUK
Strong antitoxin.  Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.

Snake braces himself against a table.  The medic is holding an
injection-type tech gizmo.

MEDIC
Take off the jacket.

SNAKE
I'll be OK.

HAUK
Let's go, Plissken.

Snake shrugs off his jacket, disoriented by the place.  He's nervous.
His hackles are up.

SNAKE
I don't like needles.

Hauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand.  He activates it and
the time blinks on.  It's counting down as we speak.

HAUK
Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds...

SNAKE
We talked about twenty-four.

HAUK
In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over.  China and
the Soviet Union will go back home.  The president was on his way to the
summit when his plane went down.

Snake snorts.

HAUK
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.  The tape recording inside has
to reach Hartford in 22 hours.

SNAKE
What's on it?

HAUK
You know anything about nuclear fusion?

Snake turns away.  No.  Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise.

HAUK
It's about the survival of the human race, Plissken.  Something you
don't give a shit about.

Hauk steps aside.  The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.

MEDIC
I'm going to inject you.  It'll sting for a second or two...

He raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them.  Snake jumps a
little; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things.

HAUK
That's it, Plissken.

Snake gets off the table.  The medic turns around.

MEDIC
Tell him.

SNAKE
Tell me what?

Hauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that.

HAUK
That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and
flying off to Canada.

Hauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the
medic.

SNAKE
What did you do to me, asshole?

HAUK
My idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Two
microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already starting
to dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve.
Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive.
About the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to --
(he gestures)
open up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen
seconds --

Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.

SNAKE
TAKE THEM OUT NOW.

MEDIC
They're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour is
up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.

Snake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  This
is his life he's watching tick away.

HAUK
We'll burn out the charges IF you have the President.

SNAKE
What if I'm a little late?

HAUK
No more Hartford Summit.  And no more Snake Plissken.

SNAKE
When I get back I'm going to kill you.

HAUK
The Gullfire's waiting.

EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
Snake pulls up in a Jeep.  He walks up to the tiny plane called the
Gullfire.  Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane
and does his job.  He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and
closes the overhead window.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake turns on his monitors.

SNAKE
I'm ready.

HAUK
21 hours.

SNAKE
Suppose he's dead, Hauk.  If I come back without him, you'll burn these
things out?

INT. BASE --- NIGHT
Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to
come up.

HAUK
Get them both back, Plissken.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about
it.

HAUK
Remember, once inside you're on your own.

SNAKE
Oh, you mean I can't count on you?

HAUK
No.

SNAKE
Good.

EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
A larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is
essentially a big hang glider.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk checks Snake's life clock, "Master Life Clock".
20:17:43... 42... 41....

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake's watch reads 20:17:40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35...
He starts controlling the plane.  He flips the tracer open and hits the
button, testing it.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
The master life clock shows the test confirmation.

COMPUTER
Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds.

Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake takes the plane in.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake looks over his monitors.  He sees New York coming up.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk waits at his microphone.

HAUK
Are you picking up the target blip?

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Right on course.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The plane aims for the World Trade Center.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
It's been a while . . .

The plane is aiming right at a building.

HAUK
How's your altitude?

Snake calmly angles the plane up.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken?  Plissken?  Plissken, what are you doing?

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Playing with myself.  I'm going in.

Snake targets the World Trade Center.  He checks his instruments.

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
The plane comes down.  It hits hard.  Snake puts on the brakes, adds a
grappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken?  Plissken?

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake walks over to the elevator.  He uses the power box to get the
elevator started.  He looks around, and the doors open.  He gets in the
elevator.  The doors close.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake's voice comes through the radio.

SNAKE
I'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor.  Just like
Leningrad, Hauk.

HAUK
Is the glider intact?

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti-
covered building.

SNAKE
Yeah, but taking off is for shit.  I'll work it out.

HAUK
You'll have to use the east stairwell.  It'll take you a little while to
get to ground level.

Snake checks his life clock.  19:22:44. 43. 42.

HAUK
Call me when you get outside.

Snake puts his walkie-talkie away as someone runs past.  He doesn't
notice.  He walks on.

FADE OUT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADE IN.
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake walks along with his tracer.  He goes through alleys and streets.
He draws his gun as he walks by a group of people.  He's armed and ready
to fight.

EXT. PLANE CRASH -- NIGHT
The plane is still burning.  Smoke is coming from everywhere.  The plane
is severed in the middle.  The crash is very impressive.  Snake walks
and notices a few people go by.  He pulls out his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
I'm at the plane.  Nobody else made it, Hauk.

Something beeps.  His tracer.

SNAKE
Wait a minute.

He looks at his tracer.  A small red dot lights up in the southeast
corner.

SNAKE
I've got his pulse.  Right up ahead, moving northwest.

He puts away his walkie-talkie and checks his life clock.  18:50:18.
17.  16.

DISSOLVE TO:
Images.  Snake holding the tracer.  He gets closer and comes up to a
building, formerly a theater.  He walks in.

INT. THEATER -- NIGHT
The pulse keeps getting stronger.  Snake walks in.  He holds his gun at
the ready.  There's a truly horrible musical going on.

INT. STAGE -- NIGHT

ACTORS
This is hell!  This is hate!  (etc.)

Snake looks around.  No sign of the president, but there is a CABBIE
enjoying the show.  Time to move on.  He enters against his better
judgment, but he's just passing through, so that's OK.

INT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
Snake keeps moving, but there's a noise.  He turns around, aiming his
gun.  Cabbie holds up his hands.

CABBIE
Hey!  You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?

SNAKE
What do you want?

CABBIE
Nothin'.

Snake lowers his gun.

CABBIE
I thought you were dead!

Snake moves on.

CABBIE
Hey!  You don't want to walk around down there, Snake!

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer.  Snake walks
past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl.  He doesn't
take much notice.  He keeps going.  He sees a BUM sitting by a fire.

BUM
Hi, Chief.  Nice night.  Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey.

A guy tries to sneak up behind Snake.  Snake knocks him out and points
his gun at the bum.

BUM
Easy now, chief.  I'm walking.  I'm walking.

The bum walks away.  Snake keeps going.  A man beats up another man at a
sink.  The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer.  Snake kicks
the beater and knocks him out.

SNAKE
Mr. President . . .

The man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles.  He's a DRUNK.

DRUNK
I'm the President?  Sure, I'm the President.  If I knew where I got this
thing --
(indicates the tracer)
I'd be the President.

SNAKE
Where did you get it?

DRUNK
I woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle . . .

Snake slams the tracer against the sink.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
The President's life signs all fail.

OFFICIAL
Oh my god . . .

MEDIC
It . . . It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . . .

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
Hauk?!

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
I'm right here, Plissken.

SNAKE
I don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's NOT the
President.

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake holds the walkie-talkie up to the drunk.

DRUNK
(to the tune of Joy to the World)
Hail to the chief . . . La la la la la la . . .

SNAKE
All right, get your machine ready.  I'm coming out.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
18 hours, Plissken.

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Listen to me, Hauk.  The President is DEAD, you got that?  Somebody's
had him for dinner!

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken, if you get back in that glider I'll shoot you down.  You climb
out, I'll burn you off the wall.  You understand that, Plissken?

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake stares at his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
A little human compassion . . .

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake walks on.  He's in an area with streetlights.  He keeps going.

EXT. POD -- NIGHT
Snake stares at the pod.  No clues.  He looks around.  Nothing.  As he
comes back up, he sets up a chair and sits down heavily.  He touches his
neck.  It's like he can feel the cores dissolving.

A crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers.  Snake doesn't know what
he's doing, but he doesn't like it.  Especially not when the manhole
covers start to rise up.  He runs off.

EXT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
Snake finds the restaurant, and runs inside.  No one follows.

INT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
Snake backs into a corner.  The floor is weak and starts to go out from
under him once.  He gets into the shadows.  There's someone there.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You a cop?

Snake levels his gun at her.

SNAKE
No . . .

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You've got a gun.  You got a smoke?

Snake tosses her his cigarettes.  She lights one.

SNAKE
Keep your hand over it.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
It's all right if we're quiet.  They won't hear us.
(reacting to the cigarette)
Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in?

SNAKE
What's going on out there?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Crazies.  It's the end of the month.  They're out of food.

SNAKE
Do you live here?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Skulls?  You kidding?  I'm with the Turks now.  I just got caught in the
street after dark and now I'm stuck here all night.

SNAKE
A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
No.

SNAKE
Shit.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You're a cop.

SNAKE
I'm an asshole.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Hey, wait a minute.  I know who you are.  Yeah!  But I heard you were
dead.

SNAKE
I am.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!  What you doing in here with a gun,
Snake?

SNAKE
Looking for somebody.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Who?

SNAKE
The President.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Come on!  He really here?

SNAKE
Somewhere.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
When you find him, are you gonna take him out?

SNAKE
Mm-hm.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Take me out with you, Snake.

SNAKE
Why?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
I can think of lots of reasons why . . .

She makes a move to kiss him, but there's a noise.  They split up, but
she gets sucked through the floor.  Snake tries to save her, but it's
too late.  He gets the hell out of there.

INT. BUILDING -- NIGHT, EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT, EXT. ALLEYS -- NIGHT
Snake runs through the building, breaks a window, and climbs up a fire
escape to get to a new floor.  He breaks a window to get in, then pulls
a cabinet in front of the window.  He shoots through the cabinet,
causing some crazy to scream.  He busts down a door, shoots open part of
a wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a
telephone pole.  He then climbs up a wall.  On the way he drops his
walkie-talkie.  He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up.

CABBIE
Where you goin', buddy?

Snake points his gun at Cabbie.  He looks behind him, then gets in the
cab.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from "American
Bandstand."

CABBIE
Bad neighborhood, Snake!  You don't want to be walking from the Bowery
to 42nd street at night!  I've been driving a cab here for 30 years and
I'm telling you, you don't walk around here at night!  Yes, sir!
They'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat.  Usually I'm not
down around here myself, but I wanted to catch that show.

Cabbie lights a rag stuffed down the neck of a bottle which is full of
gasoline.

CABBIE
This stuff is like gold around here, you know.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Cabbie throws the bottle into the alley, where it explodes.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, Snake, when'd you get in?  I didn't even know they caught you.
(laughs)
Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab.  Wait'll I tell Eddie!  Hey, hang on,
Snake.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Cabbie makes a sharp turn.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?

SNAKE
Looking for somebody.

CABBIE
Well, why didn't you ask me?  Hell, I know everybody in this town.  Yes,
sir.  I've been driving this cab for thirty years, this very same cab.

Snake points his gun at Cabbie.

SNAKE
I'm GONNA ask you.  Now where's the President?

CABBIE
The Duke's got him!  Everyone knows the Duke's got him!  You don't have
to put a gun to my head.  I'll tell you!

SNAKE
Who's the Duke?

CABBIE
The DUKE!  The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!  The big man, that's who!

SNAKE
I want to meet this Duke.

CABBIE
You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?  Nobody wants to meet the Duke!
You meet him once and then you're dead!

Snake points the gun more insistently.  Tough.

EXT. BRAIN'S BUILDING -- NIGHT
Cabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building.

CABBIE
I hate to leave her on the street.  Usually I don't leave her alone at
all.  But you're a special case, Snake.

He and Snake walk up to the door.  Cabbie knocks on the door with his
shoe.

CABBIE
It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.  You can relax.

Relax?  Snake checks his life clock.  17:40:46. 45. 44.  Relax, my ass.

SNAKE
Thanks.

CABBIE
Boy, they got a great place here.  Like a fortress!

SNAKE
They?

From the inside, someone answers.

MAGGIE
Who is it?

CABBIE
It's me!

MAGGIE
Who's me?

CABBIE
Cabbie!

MAGGIE
What do you want?

CABBIE
Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important --

MAGGIE
No way, Cabbie --

CABBIE
No, it's Snake!  Snake Plissken!

Maggie opens the door.  She stands there and surveys the pair.

MAGGIE
YOU'RE Plissken?

CABBIE
He wants to see Brain.

MAGGIE
Why?

SNAKE
I want to meet the Duke.

Snake and Maggie exchange a glance.  She leads them in.

INT. BRAIN'S -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake?  It used to be a public
library.  Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest!  Mr. Fabulous!  Duke loves
him.

SNAKE
(gesturing at Maggie)
Who's that?

CABBIE
That's Maggie.  Brain's squeeze.  The Duke gave him to Brain just to
keep him happy . . . see what I mean?

Snake can tell that Maggie's more than just Brain's squeeze; she's his
bodyguard, too.  She looks like she'd be willing to kill to protect
Brain.

MAGGIE
Heard you were dead.

INT. BRAIN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Brain?  Brain!  I brought somebody to see you!

Snake looks at Brain.  He knows this guy.

SNAKE
Harold Helman.

Brain puts down his book and stands up.

BRAIN
Snake?

MAGGIE
"Harold"?

SNAKE
Where you been, Harold?  It's been a long time.

MAGGIE
You never told me you knew Snake Plissken, Brain.

CABBIE
Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare
some . . .

No one pays attention.  Snake advances on Brain.  Brain sits down.

SNAKE
I'm glad you remember me.  Yeah.  A man should remember his past.
Kansas City, four years ago.  You ran out on me.  You left me sitting
there.

BRAIN
You were late.

SNAKE
We were buddies, Harold.  You, me, and Fresno Bob.  You know what they
did to Bob?

His face changes.  He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and
points his gun.

Maggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake.

SNAKE
You want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby?
(to Brain)
Where's the President?!

BRAIN
Swear to god, Snake, I don't know --

SNAKE
Don't fuck with me!

BRAIN
Why do you want to know?

SNAKE
I want him.

BRAIN
Working for the man now, huh?

SNAKE
Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --

BRAIN
Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is and unless you know
EXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you'll never find him.

Snake takes his gun away.  He contemplates Brain.

SNAKE
Listen, I'll take you out of here.  Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of
blocks down the street.  And all you gotta do is get me to him.

Everyone realizes the importance of this.

CABBIE
No kidding?  On the level?  Will you take me, too?

BRAIN
We've got to deal somewhere else.

SNAKE
No glider.

MAGGIE
We've got the President.  And the Duke's taking everybody out of here.

SNAKE
Never happen.  See, I know something you and the Duke don't know.  We've
only got so long before Mr. President don't mean a whole lot.

BRAIN
You're lying.

MAGGIE
Maybe he's not . . .

BRAIN
I know him!  Look at his face, he's lying!

SNAKE
Right, Harold.  I'm lying.  So I might as well have some fun and keep
looking by myself.

He cocks his gun and points it at Brain again.

MAGGIE
Brain --

SNAKE
Talk to him, baby --

MAGGIE
Brain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him --

CABBIE
(panicking)
Brain, you've got to tell him!

MAGGIE
(panicking)
Brain, you've got to tell him --

CABBIE
(panicked)
Tell him, tell him, tell him --

BRAIN
ALL RIGHT!!!

Snake lowers the gun.

SNAKE
You always were smart, Harold.

BRAIN
Just one thing right now.  Don't call me "Harold."

EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT
Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out.

SNAKE
So you work for this Duke, huh?

BRAIN
Yeah.  Make gas for him.  Figure out things for him.

SNAKE
Like what?

BRAIN
(showing off)
Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know
where they're planted.

MAGGIE
We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before
they shot the poor bastard.

BRAIN
We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade.

CABBIE
What a sight, Snake!  The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and
the President right out front!  Oh, that would have been so fine . . .

MAGGIE
(ironically)
Yeah, it would have been . . .

CABBIE
Yeah, but we're going with Snake now.

The three of them cross into the street.  Cabbie panics.

CABBIE
That's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke
-- everybody knows that.

We get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is
gone and his cab is racing away.

MAGGIE
Cabbie, you slime!

The Duke's car heads right for us.

MAGGIE
No, Brain!

The two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of
them hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended
over the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A
fourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of
a car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at
his side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy
jacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock
on the door.

MAGGIE
He's looking for you, Brain.

SNAKE
What does he want?

BRAIN
He wants my diagram of the bridge.  When he finds out I'm with you he's
going to want my life!  Shit, Plissken, I knew I shouldn't have listened
to you --

SNAKE
We've got to get to the President NOW, while he's busy.

BRAIN
Forget it, he's on the other side of town and we got no wheels.  The
deal is off --

SNAKE
Just calm down.

EXT. CAR -- NIGHT
A lone man sits, looking bored.  Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him
out, and gets him out of the car.  He briefly considers shooting the guy
on the hood of the car.  Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks
around.  Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get
Brain and Maggie.  He knocks the other guy out of the car.

BRAIN
(panicked)
I think they saw us!  Turn left, turn left here!

INT. CAR -- NIGHT

MAGGIE
Brain, this is Broadway.

BRAIN
I know, I know, the Duke'll take Seventh Avenue, Broadway is five
minutes --

MAGGIE
No!!!

BRAIN
Yes!!!  Just keep driving!

SNAKE
What's wrong with Broadway?

EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT

SNAKE
(to the car)
Come on sweetheart . . .

People start throwing bricks.  Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes
it to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold
a purse).  Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who
gets on the car.  A bystander grabs Brain.

BRAIN
Maggie!

Maggie protects him.  She shoots the people grabbing at him.  Snake
angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away.  He glares
at Brain.  Everyone seems visibly shaken.

SNAKE
Hold on.

Snake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars.  He takes off, the
car a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on
Broadway.

EXT. TRAINS -- NIGHT
Brain points to the cars as Snake watches.

BRAIN
He'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire.

Snake looks around.  The Duke's caravan passes.  There are more cars
than there were before.

BRAIN
It's all right.  He's got to go in the front way.  It'll take him five
minutes.  If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your
own.

SNAKE
When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking.

They drive off.  Snake gets to the trains.  No one notices.  Maggie and
Brain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car.

BRAIN
Hi, guys.  Hi . . . how's it going?  Cooled off a little, huh?

HEAD DUDE
What do you want, Brain?

BRAIN
Duke told us to wait inside.  He's on his way here now.

HEAD DUDE
He didn't say nothing to us about it.

BRAIN
Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you?
That's why he's the Duke.

The camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad
cars.  He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to
wonder if Brain double-crossed him.

HEAD DUDE
Why don't we wait outside here for him?

BRAIN
Why don't we wait inside for him?

HEAD DUDE
'Cause I got orders, that's why.

BRAIN
What are your specific orders, by the way?

HEAD DUDE
Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside.

BRAIN
How's the President holding up, by the way?  Any political discussion
you've had with him?

INT. PRESIDENT'S TRAIN CAR -- NIGHT
Two guards sit with the President, talking.  The first guard is by the
President.  The second is looking out the window.

SECOND GUARD
That Brain is a real pain in the ass.  He's always sniffing around like
a dog.

FIRST GUARD
He comes up with the gas.

The second guard looks out the window.  Snake grabs him by the neck, and
breaks it.  The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and
that tips off the guard.

FIRST GUARD
What are you looking at?

He turns and Snake throws a star at him.  It lodges right in his brain,
but not fast enough.  Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow.

Snake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him.  The
president still has the briefcase.  This is it, this is the big time.
Snake keeps calm.

PRESIDENT
Are you from the outside?

SNAKE
Stop shaking.

PRESIDENT
I can't!  Who are you?

SNAKE
Hauk sent me.  We've got to move fast.

PRESIDENT
Move fast?  You're goddamned right I'll move fast.

SNAKE
Quiet!

Snake limps away, President in the lead.

EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT
Snake and the President keep moving.  Suddenly, Snake gets jumped.  Ten
guys surround him and the President, and though Snake fights well, it's
not well enough.  Brain comes out with Maggie.

BRAIN
They got him.  Now watch him.

The Duke steps out from the car, followed by Weirdo.

DUKE
Friend of yours, Brain?

BRAIN
He had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing I could do.

DUKE
(not believing it for a second)
Uh-huh.

Weirdo points accusingly as he and Duke walk away.

BRAIN
Maggie . . .

Duke walks up to Snake.  Snake isn't giving in even though he's pretty
sure he's beat.

DUKE
Who are you?

Snake doesn't answer.  Duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right
leg and pulls on it.  Snake writhes in agony.

DUKE
I said who are you?

BRAIN
Snake Plissken, Duke.  The Man sent him in here.  Something's going down
. . . we need him.

Duke recognizes the name.  He is impressed.  He lets go of the arrow.
Snake hates him more than ever.

DUKE
Snaaaaaake Plissken.  I've heard of you.

He raises a crowbar over his head and smacks Snake with it, knocking him
out.

DUKE
I heard you were dead.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
A helicopter flies over the city.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The pilot looks at a grid-view of New York.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is surveillance 4 to security control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Nothing in the searchlight. There aren't any fires on the
street.  Nobody moving down here.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President wait.

SURVEILLANCE 5
Surveillance 5 . . . security control . . . negative on infrared body
scan . . . no movement in the searchlight . . . nothing strange going on
down there.

They look at the Master Life Clock.  12:27:39.  38. Where's Plissken?

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Plissken lies unconscious on a bed, crossbow pointed at his head.  Three
guards are at the ready.

INT. BASE -- DAY

VICE PRESIDENT
We've got to go in now.

HAUK
We hold.

VICE PRESIDENT
You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.

HAUK
This is my prison, I'll give the orders.

VICE PRESIDENT
I override all that!

HAUK
Just try.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY
Unbelievable smog.  Helicopters fly.

SURVEILLANCE ?
...still negative on the scan.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative on the sweep.

EXT. WALL -- DAY
Hauk stands on the wall, listening.

SURVEILLANCE 10
Surveillance 10.  Still negative on the scan.

SURVEILLANCE 5
Surveillance 5 still negative.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative...

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Snake begins to come to.  We hear gunshots and cheering.  The guards go
to announce Snake's consciousness.

INT. HANGAR -- DAY
Brain and Maggie move to the center of the gunshots and cheering

INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY
The Duke sits firing with Plissken's gun at the President, whose
briefcase is still chained to his arm.

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Snake sits up.  There are LOTS of crossbows aimed at him.

GUARD
Don't move, Snake.

Snake turns to face him.  He stands up.  We see for the first time
exactly why he's called "Snake" Plissken.  There's a snake tattooed on
his stomach.  The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a
good idea of where it leads and what it becomes.  Ah ha.

Snake's life clock is gone.  He has no idea how much time he's got.
Shit.

INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY

DUKE
I want that diagram, Brain.

BRAIN
Oh. It's at my place, Duke.  Duke, that Plissken said something about a
time limit.

DUKE
What time limit?

BRAIN
(gesturing at President)
On him.

DUKE
That's a lot of crap.
(to the President)
What did I teach you?

PRESIDENT
(weakly)
You... You are... the Duke of New... New York... You're... A-Number-One.

DUKE
I can't hear you.

PRESIDENT
YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK... YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE!

DUKE
(to Brain)
Get me the diagram.

BRAIN
Duke... Don't kill Plissken.  We need him.

The Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance.

DUKE
Get moving, Brain.

Brain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh.  The Duke fires at the
President's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down
and kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then
puts it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke
has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had.

Which is not saying much.

EXT. NEW YORK -- LATE AFTERNOON
Helicopters fly above ground.  A group stands with a car, gesturing
wildly.

INT. HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

PILOT
People out below in the park.  Can you see them?

INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON

PILOT
Surveillance 2 to Security Control.  We're getting that readout, mostly
in the infrared.

Hauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor.  At least something's
going on.

PILOT
We have a visual sighting on it.  It's a crowd of prisoners in Central
Park.  They're waving at us.  Signaling us in the food drop area.
They're waving us down.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON
The prisoners wave the helicopters down.  A group of guards lands and
runs over to the station wagon.  They get the briefcase which has been
sawed off the President's handcuffs.

INT. ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
Snake is awake and surrounded by guards.  The cheers are louder.

INT. BRAIN'S -- LATE AFTERNOON
Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun.  It's one of Snake's.

BRAIN
I still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was
telling the truth or not.  God, I hate that guy.

Brain stands in front of his maps.

MAGGIE
He got in somehow.

BRAIN
Yeah, yeah, but how?  You gotta land the glider and take off.
(he gestures at the map)
You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port
Authority's too low to the ground.  Unless it was some...
(he gets it... they don't call him "Brain" for nothing)
Someplace high up.  World Trade Center.  That's it.  There we go.  The
World Trade Center.  And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to
take off than it was for him to land.

INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON
Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase.

HAUK
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President.
69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.  No bullshit or he's dead."

VICE PRESIDENT
Where's the tape?

HAUK
Not here.

He reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles.

REHME
They're Plissken's.

Yeah, they were on the table.  He never did use them, though, and only
half of them is necessary in his case anyway.

VICE PRESIDENT
So much for your man, Hauk?

Hauk hesitates.  This is the last thing he wants.

HAUK
Warm up the choppers.  We're moving in.

EXT. BASE -- SUNSET
Helicopters prepare for takeoff.

INT. BASE -- SUNSET
Hauk sits at the microphone.

HAUK
Plissken?

The master life clock reads 1:56:38. 37. 36,

INT. ROOM -- SUNSET
Snake slowly gets to his feet.  He's still groggy, but it's time for him
to move.

GUARD
Come on, get up!

Snake limps through a hallway and into a stadium.

INT. STADIUM -- SUNSET
Boos greet Snake as he walks in.  In the center of the room is a
fighting ring.  Snake climbs in, not without effort.  A huge and
extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers.  Snake
notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock.  In the
balcony above is the Duke.  The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and
everyone gets silent.

DUKE
They sent in their best man.  And when we roll down the 69th street
bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man
leading the way.  From the neck up.

The crowd cheers.

DUKE
On the hood of my car!

More cheers.

DUKE
Let's do it!

Ugly and Snake take bats.  They circle each other.  Ugly strikes at
Snake.  Snake ricochets off the ring.  He rolls around, fighting for his
life.

INT. BUILDING -- SUNSET
Brain and Maggie walk around.  They knock on a door and Weirdo answers.
He's wearing Cabbie's hat.

WEIRDO
Hello.

BRAIN
Where'd you get the hat?

WEIRDO
Got it from Cabbie.

BRAIN
Yeah?

WEIRDO
Traded him.

BRAIN
For what?

WEIRDO
What are you so nervous about?

BRAIN
I'm here to see the President.

WEIRDO
Who says?

BRAIN
The Duke.

WEIRDO
No he doesn't.

BRAIN
Well... I'll have to tell him you said that.

Weirdo doesn't really believe it.  If it's not true, so what?

But if it IS true, the Duke will have him tortured to death.

WEIRDO
Wait a minute.  Why?

BRAIN
He's got something hidden in his clothing.  The Duke wants it.

WEIRDO
What?

BRAIN
I'll show you.

WEIRDO
You'll tell me.

BRAIN
Cyanide capsules.  The Duke don't want a dead president.

Brain pushes his way in.

INT. ROOM -- SUNSET

BRAIN
Gentlemen.  Mr. President.

Weirdo lets the door slide closed.  Brain starts checking the
President's clothes.  The President has been dressed in a wig and tied
to a chair with an American Flag on it.

WEIRDO
Cyanide?

BRAIN
Yeah.  He might try to take it tomorrow.

Weirdo walks up to Brain.

WEIRDO
That's bullshit.  You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --

Brain stabs Weirdo, who dies with a gasp.  Maggie dispatches of the
three guards.  She smiles.  Brain unties the President's hand.  The
President snatches off the wig in a rage.

INT. TOURNAMENT -- SUNSET
Snake notices a guard wearing the eagle tracer.  A trash can lid and a
bat with spikes on it is handed to him.  The next round begins.

EXT. HOUSE -- EVENING
Brain, the President, and Maggie sneak out.  A guy in a cowboy hat
notices.

INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
Ugly and Snake keep fighting.  Snake is not doing very well.  But he's
catching up.  As Ugly tries to hit him, he nails Ugly in the groin, then
in the back of the head.  The crowd begins cheering "SNAKE!  SNAKE!"
The Duke can't believe it.  Snake runs to the guard with the tracer and
activates it.

INT. BASE -- EVENING
The Master Life Clock begins blinking "Tracer Status: ACTIVATED."

COMPUTER
Tracer activated at one hour, thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

Rehme jumps out of his seat.

REHME
Hauk!!

INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
Snake limps around, getting his stuff back together.  He looks at his
life clock.  1:34:54.  53.  He doesn't have much time.

The guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the Duke and yells for attention.
Duke immediately gets up and leaves, as do his hangers-on.

GUY IN COWBOY HAT
LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!

The crowd shuts up.

GUY IN COWBOY HAT
THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!  BRAIN TOOK HIM!

The crowd rushes out.  Snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast
as he can.

EXT. BASE -- EVENING
Rehme catches up to Hauk at the last second.  Hauk has been stalling.

REHME
(shouting over noise)
Hauk!  Plissken's tracer!

Hauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot.

HAUK
Get on the radio!  Keep them down!  Nobody move!

INT. BASE -- EVENING
Two monitors show Snake's tracer.

REHME
He's approaching the World Trade Center.

HAUK
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

REHME
He's inside.

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- EVENING
Snake limps around.  He notices a cab.  Fifty flights of stairs with
his leg shot to hell.  He hesitates only for a second, then starts up.

INT. BASE -- EVENING
The Vice President, Hauk and Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors.

VICE PRESIDENT
It's gone.

HAUK
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.  Download the choppers.  We're in
a standby situation.

Rehme runs off.

VICE PRESIDENT
Anybody could have pushed that button.

HAUK
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.  Now we'll give him a
little more time, just to make sure.

The master clock shows 59:44. 43.

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake gets out of the elevator.  Maggie, Brain, and the President all
take cover behind a chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down
the glider.  It doesn't work.  The glider floats away.

BRAIN
Goddamned redskins!  They're savages, Mr. President!

Snake runs to get them.  They get in the elevator.

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake has the President by the arm and is leading everyone out.

BRAIN
Listen, Snake, I swear to god, I thought you were dead --

SNAKE
Yeah, you and everybody else.

He grabs Brain by the tie and aims the gun at his head.

SNAKE
That's your car in the lobby?  The keys!  Quick!  Quick!  Diagram of the
bridge!  Hey, hey, hey --

Snake takes all the abovementioned items.

BRAIN
I'm the only one who knows how to read that, Snake --

SNAKE
Stay out of my way, Harold.

BRAIN
Besides, you can't read and drive at the same time.  You need us!

Snake is tired.  He's pissed.  He's got half an hour to live if that.
He doesn't have time for Brain's shit, and he lets him know it.

SNAKE
You shouldn't have double-crossed me again, Brain.  Come on, let's go --

He suddenly notices there's nothing on the end of the President's chain.
He holds it in front of the President's face.

PRESIDENT
They sawed it off...

SNAKE
The tape?

PRESIDENT
Gone... I don't know where...

BRAIN
I do.

Snake shoots him a look.  Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is
telling the truth.  Maybe.

BRAIN
Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is.  Just take us to the car and
I'll take you right to it.

SNAKE
Shit...

He tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain.  They go down the stairs.
Snake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining.

MAGGIE
Don't talk.  Breathe.

PRESIDENT
Come on, come on, we're wasting time!

Snake gets into the car.  It won't start.

BRAIN
What's wrong?

SNAKE
Dead, Harold.

BRAIN
What?!

Snake hands the keys to Brain.

SNAKE
Here, take these.

Snake looks under the hood.  There's a man with a crossbow pointed
straight at him.  Shit.  They've been caught.  Again.

DUKE
Car trouble?

Snake looks over the hood.  There's the Duke.  With a dozen guards.
Brain steps out.

BRAIN
Hi, Duke.

DUKE
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.  You and Brain just say good-
bye to each other.

The Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment.  At that
moment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent.  At the same
time, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow.  Steam
flies everywhere, enough for cover.  The four of them run for it.  The
Duke runs after them.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
A cab pulls up.  Its radio is playing "American Bandstand".  Guess who's
driving?  You got it!

The group of four runs up to the cab.  Snake runs around and makes
Cabbie scoot over.  He wants to drive.  Cabbie looks shocked.

PRESIDENT
GO, GO!

The Duke and his followers arrive too late.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

BRAIN
(trying to explain the map)
...and then there's three more...

Snake waves him off.  Cabbie's trying to make conversation.

MAGGIE
They're behind us --

BRAIN
They come in groups of threes!

Snake pops the American Bandstand tape out of the tape player and puts
it in his pocket.

SNAKE
Where's the tape, Brain?

CABBIE
What tape?

SNAKE
Where is it?

BRAIN
Tape...

PRESIDENT
The tape from the briefcase!

CABBIE
Oh, that tape!

He pulls it out of his pocket.

CABBIE
Here it is!

Cabbie hands it to Snake.  Brain laughs, trying to cover his ass.

BRAIN
You traded away your hat for it!

CABBIE
How'd you know?

BRAIN
See, see!

Snake pops it into the deck.  It begins spewing out information.  It's
the right one.  He slips it into his pocket.

PRESIDENT
Here, give me that tape!

HA!  No way!

SNAKE
Not just yet.

Snake checks his life clock.  23:20. 19. 18. 17.  Didn't that guy say 15
minutes before the last hour was up?  But Hauk said they'd been playing
with this, so the 15 minutes was built in already.  Still, 23 minutes.
That's cutting it pretty fucking close.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake races as fast as the cab can go.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely.
They're not.  The Duke is behind, but he's FAR behind.

CABBIE
Easy... easy!

BRAIN
Go for it, Snake!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle.  Cabbie looks like he's
having a heart attack.

Snake swerves on Brain's direction.  So far so good.  A mine goes off,
but it's behind them.

The Duke goes forward.  He's going by the seat of his pants.  But he
knows the general direction of how Snake went.  A mine goes off behind
him, too.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Brain reads the map.  Cabbie continues to freak out.

CABBIE
You've got to slow down a little, Snake...

BRAIN
I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.

MAGGIE
You think?!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The Duke continues in pursuit.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

BRAIN
Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when I tell you.

CABBIE
You're pushing her too hard, Snake.

BRAIN
OK, OK, NOW!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The cab explodes, being cut right in half.  Everyone makes it except
Cabbie.  Cabbie had been driving that very same cab for thirty years.
He died with it.

The President, Snake, Maggie and Brain all keep going on foot.

BRAIN
I said JOG RIGHT!... you asshole.

Brain leads the way as they keep crossing the bridge.

BRAIN
Stay to the right, stay to the right, now jog left.  Hold it, left...
left... LEFT, DAMMIT!

The other three go right.  Brain goes left and a mine explodes under
him.  Maggie walks up to the body in shock.  Snake limps up to her.

MAGGIE
Brain...

SNAKE
Keep moving...

The Duke's car is coming.  Snake checks his life clock

SNAKE
Maggie... he's dead.  Come on.

Maggie calmly holds out her hand.  Snake smiles and hands her his gun.
His grin grows.  It's one of respect for what she's about to do.  He
runs off after the President.

Maggie walks around to Brain, then steps in front of him.  She points
the gun at the Duke's car.  The first three shots don't connect.  The
fourth nails the headlight, and then the Duke runs her over.  He keeps
going.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme runs up to Hauk and the Vice President.

REHME
Station 19!  They spotted two cars on the 69th street bridge.

HAUK
Is it Plissken?

REHME
Taxicab and a Cadillac.  Taxi hit a mine.  There's four people on foot.

VICE PRESIDENT
Fourteen minutes...

HAUK
Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.

He pulls out a phone.

HAUK
Strombaerden!  Get over to Station 19.  They're coming across the
bridge.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The President and Snake run on.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
A jeep pulls up.  Rehme's voice comes up over the loudspeaker.  The
guards on the jeep ready the winch.

REHME
 This is Rehme, Security Control.  We are in a standby situation.
Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.  All helicopters, down.  Wall
guard, do not fire on prisoners.  Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.  All
vehicles, stand by.  Repeat, stand by.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake and the President are close enough to the wall to hear all this.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
The wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the President
and Snake.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake pushes the President up to the wall.  The winch comes down and
Snake helps the President into it first.  The President goes up and
over.  Snake's life clock reads 1:32.  But he doesn't have time to watch
seconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him.
Snake ducks for cover.  The wall guards die.  The winch comes down
again, and the Duke sees it.  He starts toward it.  Snake tackles him
and beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out.  He grabs the
winch.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
A hand stops the winch from moving.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake comes to a stop.  He panics and starts pulling on the winch line.
The Duke comes to and stands up.  But he can't get anywhere because the
President has found a machine gun and is now firing away.  He is very
accurate.  He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing.

PRESIDENT
(manic voice)
Yeah, hey, Number One!  You're the Duke!  You're the Duke!

The President calms down somewhat.

PRESIDENT
You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.

The President starts the winch again.  Snake climbs up and gets over as
fast as he can without injuring himself.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine.  Hauk interrupts the medic.

HAUK
The tape, Plissken.

Snake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk.  He
is furious.  As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back.
He holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck.  They buzz, they buzz
louder, and then he takes them away.

MEDIC
That's it.

Snake continues to pant and fume.  He stares at them, then lifts his
wrist to look at his life clock.  2 seconds.  One second.

Beep.

Nothing.

Snake lowers his wrist.

EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
A jeep pulls Rehme up.  He jogs to the President, who is being shaved
and prepared for broadcast.

REHME
I radioed ahead, Mr. President.  They know the situation.  They're
waiting for your broadcast.

PRESIDENT
Yeah.

Snake approaches.  The President nods.

PRESIDENT
Oh, it's all right.

Snake walks up and looks the President straight in the eye.

PRESIDENT
I, uh... I want to thank you.  Anything you want... you just name it.

SNAKE
Just a moment of your time.

AIDE
Three minutes, sir.

PRESIDENT
Yes?

SNAKE
We did get you out.  A lot of people died in the process.  I just
wondered how you felt about it.

PRESIDENT
I want to thank them.  This nation appreciates their sacrifice.

The President is full of shit after all.  Snake has reason for his
cynicism.  The President is uncomfortable with Snake's glare and it
shows.

PRESIDENT
Look, uh, I'm on the air in...
(questioning his aide)
Two and a half minutes?

AIDE
Yes, sir.

Snake lights a cigarette and walks away.  Rehme watches.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake walks away.  Hauk stands nearby.  Snake stops in his tracks.

HAUK
You going to kill me now, Snake?

SNAKE
I'm too tired.  Maybe later.

HAUK
I've got another deal for you.  I want you to think it over while you're
resting.  I want to give you a job.  We'd make one hell of a team,
Snake.

SNAKE
(glaring)
The name's Plissken.

He limps away.

EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
The President looks suitably freshened up.  He's even smiling a little.

AIDE
You're on camera, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT
Good evening.  Although I shall not be present at this historic summit
meeting, I present this, in the hope that our great nations may learn to
live in peace.

He pops in the tape and presses the "PLAY" button...

...and out comes "American Bandstand".

The President's face goes slack.  His career's over.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake keeps limping.  He pulls a tape out of his pocket, yanks the
magnetic tape out, winds it around his hand, rips it to shreds, and
throws the tape away.

      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      FADE IN:

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               It was then that the dark spirits
               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.
               And there it lay for 700 years...

      As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same

      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its
      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and

      TRACKING SHOT

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

      A great wind billows fog about the place.

               Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife,
               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small
               cabin where they could study it
               undisturbed.

      Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and
      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.

      down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and
      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.

      A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten

      He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and
      distraught.

               It has only been a few hours since
               I've translated and spoke aloud the first
               of the demon resurrection passages from
               the Book of the Dead.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO
      FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

					RAYMOND
               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this

      A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music
      on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash
      is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the
      melody with two fingers.

                              LINDA

      of lightning strikes.

      FINAL SHOT OF EVIL DEAD I

      We are racing forward.  We have taken the POV of
      an EVIL ENTITY as it glides with dark purpose through
      a section of woods. It approaches the rear door of the
      cabin.  The door is torn violently open.  The next door
      falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It
      jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of
      the cabin.  Ash is seen in the distance.  He is staggering
      away, his back to us as we race at him.  He turns suddenly
      towards CAMERA and screams.

      The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an
      extension. Ash is caught by an invisible grip.
      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the
      air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins
      tearing through the branches and smaller trees,
      clearing a path with his body.  He finally slams into
      a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked
      unconscious.

      He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us.
      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,
      his lips, jet black.  He is Possessed.  A bright edge of
      morning sunlight moves across his face.  He turns his
      beastly face skyward.

      Ash, no longer possessed, collapses into the mud puddle,
      unconscious.

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the
      woods.  We hear the shriek of demons.  The sound of
      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      vast area of empty woods around Ash.

      A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare
      out at us with evil malice.  The eyes stare out from
      the two dark windows.  The dark nose area is the open
      doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the
      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.

      like a trapped animal as he looks about for a means of
      escape.  He spots something.

      A narrow dirt road cutting through the woods. Then,

      kicks up dust and gravel.

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted
      remains of the steel and wood bridge that crossed
      a great mountain chasm.  A LOUD SCREECH of brakes
      is heard on the soundtrack on this cut.

      A sign hangs from the twisted girders.  It reads:
      "DANGEROUS BRIDGE - 2 TON WEIGHT LIMIT - CROSS AT OWN

      steps, not knowing which way to turn.

      Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as
      he begins to scream, we CUT TO:

      As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain
      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to
      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it
      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the

      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      A static shot of a closet with it's door half open.
      The door begins to swing slightly open, revealing
      a rack of clothes inside.  We hold on this for a
      moment.


85B   ANGLE - CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT       85B

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin
      to tremble and finally blow away from the light breeze
      that sweeps through the cabin.  The CAMERA PANS down
      from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of
      the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is
      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that
      slight space between the trap door and the floor we
      see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes
      a sigh of relief.

      Ed Getly stands in the FG and watches as an older
      style twin engine cargo plane flies over the camera
      and lands.


149L  AIRSTRIP - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT - PASSENGERS         149L

      The airplane rolls to a halt.  A man wearing a
      jumpsuit ties the airplane off and blocks the wheels
      while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie
      Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she
      moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers
      emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie.

                              ED
               Annie!

                              ANNIE
                         (smiling at sight of him)
               Hi.

      They embrace and kiss.

                              ED
               How'd everything go on the expedition?

                              ANNIE
               Terrific.  I found the additional pages
               from the Book of the Dead.

                              ED
               So you said in the telegram.  What
               condition are they in?

      She holds out the glass case for Ed to look at.

               Haven't aged a day in three thousand years.

                              ANNIE
               Maybe longer.

                              ED
               When do we begin the translations?

                              ANNIE
               Tonight.  Is everything all set with my
               father?

                              ED
               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap
      hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.

                              ED
               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      CHEVROLET CAR TRUNK

      CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides
      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view
      of the boarded cabin in the distance.  It approaches.
      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.


152   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          152

      Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which
      lay upon the cabin floor.  Camera pans to window #1.
      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      bedroom.


154   ASH'S POV - MIDDLE ROOM AND REAR BEDROOM              154

      As he approaches the rear bedroom, the music grows louder.
      As he enters the room he halts his gaze on the old wooden
      piano.

      MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.


156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      156

      As he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody.
      He recognizes the music.  It is the same music that Ash
      had played earlier, when Linda was dancing.


157   CLOSE SHOT - PIANO AND RADIATOR                       157

      As steam spouts from the radiator pipes.  As the piano
      keys depress and release themselves.  The melody grows
      louder.


158   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      158

      As he lowers his head.  His horror gives way to sadness.
      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      Wind sweeps in through the place as the curtains flutter
      wildly.  Through the window is a sweeping fog.

      Ash runs through this room and into the main room.  He

      The tiny figure of Ash can be seen looking off toward
      this hill.  In the foreground is a crude burial cross
      and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and
      splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed
      as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its
      feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the
      night air.

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      As it leaps through the air and gracefully situates
      itself atop Linda's neck, she begins to spin, yet her
      head remains in place, never taking her eyes from Ash.
      With a sensual twirl and leap, she disappears into the
      evening mists.

      had blown open.

      clamped to his hand.


187   INT. WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash
      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.  It is a room
      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.

      outline of where a chainsaw once was.


187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the
      chainsaw.  Behind him, the door to the shed bursts
      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.


187D  MEDIUM SHOT                                           187D

      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.


187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.


187L  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187L

      Trying to fight his feelings, he knows what he must
      do.  He pumps the throttle on the saw.


187M  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    187M

      Pleading with him.

                              LINDA
               You promised me we'd always be
               together.  You swore to me!


187N  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187N

      Agonized.

                              ASH
               NO!


187O  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             187O

      Once again fully possessed, and speaking in the voice
      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO
               LINDA! YOUR LOVE WAS A LIE!  AND
               NOW SHE BURNS IN HELL!


187P  EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S DUMMY HEAD               187P

187Q  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187Q

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.


187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R

187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.


188   CRANE SHOT - EXT. WORK SHED - NIGHT                   188

      Ash in a confused state as he staggers from the
      work shed and towards the cabin.  Again clutching
      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.


189B  INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          189B

      Ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the
      sound.


189C  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV - THE ROCKING CHAIR     189C

      It rocks back and forth with a definitive motion,
      halting for a moment at it's pints furthest forward
      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

      He slowly approaches the chair, scared shitless.


189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...


191   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM/MIRROR ROOM - NIGHT              191
      MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - ASH AND REFLECTION

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.


192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192
      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      His reflection is as it should be.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S RIGHT HAND - DUMMY HAND
      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      Wind and fog swirl about the place.  Ash's ECHOING
      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

                              ASH (0.S.)
               Give me back my hand!!

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      The hand picks up plates and begins breaking them over
      Ash's head.  Then a bottle.

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.


212   CLOSE-SHOT - HAND                                     212

      It digs its nails deep into the floorboards and begins to

214   CLOSE SHOT - HAND - GELETIN HAND                      214

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?


214A  ANGLE - ASH - COMEDY KNIFE RIG                        214A

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

      from the car.


218   ANNIE'S POV                                           218

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE
               Excuse me.  This the road to the
               Knowby's cabin?

      reads: "Dangerous Bridge - Two Ton Weight Limit".

               Hell you wanna go there for, anyway?

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs
      it into her mouth.  She doesn't like Annie and her
      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.

               that's right... There is a trail.
               You could follow Bobby Joe and me.

               That sounds all right.

      A hiking trail winds through the woods.  Bobby Joe
      leads the way with flashlight in hand.  She pockets
      some bills.  She is followed by Annie and Ed who
      carry the glass case containing the missing pages
      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

                              JAKE
               Jesus H. Christ!  I thought she
               was talkin' 'bout them two goddamn
               little pieces!

227   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT                                    227

      The wind rushes fog about the place with a fury.
      A large moon hangs in the night sky.


228   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          228
      CLOSE SHOT - EVIL HAND

      No longer attached to Ash's arm, it still writhes about
      beneath Ash's foot which pins it to the floor.


229   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - HAND'S POV - EYEMO W/ MOUNT       229

      As he grabs the steel wastebasket, dumps out the trash
      lowers it quickly over the CAMERA, trapping the hand
      within.


230   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     230

      With a note of finality, Ash slams down a pile of books
      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".


231   FIREPLACE                                             231

      Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been
      resting upon the coals.  He grits his teeth.


232   ANGLE                                                 232

      Just out of frame, Ash thrusts the glowing shovel against
      the stump to cauterize the wound.  Red steam hisses up
      into frame as Ash screams.


233   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     233

      He tosses aside the shovel and douses his smoldering
      stump into a vase of fresh flowers.


234   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      234

      Unspooling a roll of duct tape.


235   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     235

      He tapes the tablecloth into a makeshift bandage
      about his wrist.  Behind him, the wastebasket
      silently slides across the floor.


236   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     236

      "CLANG"! He turns to see.


237   CLOSE SHOT - THE WASTEBASKET                          237

      Upon its side.  The Evil Hand is gone.


237A  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      237A

      He turns to a "pitter patter" sound.

      It scampers across the floorboards headed for a hole
      in the wall.

248   CLOSE SHOT - ASH AND HAND - SQUIB                     248
      TRACKING WITH HAND, ASH IN BG

      He raises the shotgun and FIRES.  BLAM!  The floor
      next to the hand explodes.


249   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN THE WALL - SQUIB - EFX. HAND     249

      The hand leaps into the hole as a section of wall next
      to it EXPLODES.  Blam!


250   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      250

      Ash quickly reloads both chambers of the gun.
      He tracks the SOUND of the PITTER PATTER as the hand
      scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat.

254   ASH'S POV - WALL - SQUIB                              254

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

                              ASH
               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its
      middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.


258   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               258

      He raises the gun, revealing his face as the
      CAMERA PANS UP with his movement.


259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.


260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260

      The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume.


261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261

      Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and
      3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.


261A  INSERT ASH'S FINGER PULLS THE FIRST, THEN             261A
      SECOND TRIGGER


261B  INSERT FLAME BELCHES FROM THE GUN TWICE               261B


262   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      262

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      Terrified, he turns to more laughter.


276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.
      Ash turns.


276A  CLOSE SHOT                                            276A

      Other books upon the floor laugh.


277   MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                     277

      He turns sharply toward us and breaks into an
      uproariously frightening bout of laughter.


278   WIDE SHOT - ASH                                       278

      The wooden door behind Ash comes to life.  It
      stretches out as though it were elastic with each of
      its own low and terrible laughs.


279   WIDE SHOT - MAIN ROOM - TRACKING SHOT                 279
      RIGGING FOR TRAP DOOR, CABINETS, CLOCK

      Ash and everything in it are having the time of their
      lives.  Ash leads the bunch laughing harder and
      harder.


279A  MEDIUM SHOT - HAND HELD - FRONT DOOR AND ASH          279A

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

      The room's laughter suddenly stops.  Ash instantly
      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      Ash opens the front door.  It slowly swings inward
      with a creak revealing the empty night.


283   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND JAKE                            283

      Ash approaches the front porch as Jake enters sharply
      into his frame.  Jake tackles Ash.

      Ed enters and holds Ash down as Jake slugs him twice.
      Ash's fist comes up into frame catching Jake on the
      jaw.  Jake pulls back his fist and rockets a piledriver
      blow to Ash's face, knocking him senseless.

      She holds her shoulder where the shell has grazed her.

                              JAKE
               You gonna be alright, honey?

                              BOBBY JOE

287   MEDIUM SHOT - JAKE, ED, ANNIE, AND BOBBY JOE          287

      As Jake gives Ash a swift kick in the ribs.  Ash moans.

                              JAKE
               You know this son of a bitch?

                              ED
               No.  We thought her -

      Annie steps forward.

                              ANNIE
               Oh my God.  Where are my parents?

      Annie sets down the glass case containing the pages
      of the Book of the Dead.

      shirt and violently shakes him.

                              ANNIE
               What the hell did you do to them?

      Ed pulls Annie off of Ash. She drops Ash's moaning head
      to the floor and backs away from him, sobbing.

      Nursing his sore knuckles, he points with his elbow
      to the trap door that leads to the cellar.

               We'll throw him in there.


292   MEDIUM SHOT - JAKE AND ASH                            292

      the trap door. Half conscious, Ash feebly struggles
      with Jake.

      The shaft of light from above disappears and he is

                              ANNIE
               These are my father's things.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

                              PROFESSOR KNOWBY
                         (Voice on Tape)

                              PROFESSOR KNOWBY
                         (Voice on tape)

      Ash's legs in the foreground.  Suddenly from the
      earthen floor of the fruit cellar a half-rotten human
      head juts up!  Just the eyes are above the surface of the
      dirt.  They dart about wildly and halt upon Ash.  Worms
      crawl from the rotted forehead.

      leg as he tries to back away.  The corpse that was
      Henrietta pulls itself from the grave and emits a wail.
      She turns her twisted body to face Ash.  Moths fly
      about her in a flurry.

                              HENRIETTA
               Someone's in my fruit cellar!
               Someone with a fresh soul!

      With a sharp recoil, then spring, Henrietta makes a
      lunge at Ash.  Her face contorting, her teeth
      lengthening, her mouth opening impossibly wide
      as though she were going to swallow his head, and all as
      she lunges forward.  She changes to "Pee Wee" head.

      grabbing Jake.

      As he moves to help Jake, Henrietta swats at his jaw,
      knocking him backward into a picture frame. He shatters it
      with his head and slumps to the floor.

      Ash leaps down upon the trapdoor, slamming it to pin

      eyeball popping from her head, like a cork from a
      champagne bottle.

      her back down into the cellar. The trap door shuts.
      Ash leaps atop it. The sound of Henrietta falling down

      ravings.  Ash quickly threads the chains through the
      eyeloops.

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.

               in here.

                              ANNIE

      Annie starts to follow the instructions, but Ash halts
      her gently.  He shakes his head.  Annie snaps out of
      it.  She shakes her head and looks to the cellar.

                              ANNIE
               No.  No.  I don't know what you
               are but you're not my mother.

               No!

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

      stark shadow of possessed Ed which is cast upon the
      wall behind her.  We watch as the shadow of Ash with the
      axe, slices through the top portion of possessed Ed's

               Start up that saw and hand it here!
               We're gonna cut him up.

      Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body
      of Ed.  She is repulsed at the thought.

                              ANNIE
               No.

                              ASH

      Jake slowly stands into the empty frame. He is in shock
      from what he has just seen.  Annie slowly rises into
      frame - shaking her head in a silent "No." Ash slowly

      Jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room.
      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      Raymond Knowby emerges from the wall.  A life like
      spirit made of swirling smoke and mist.

                              RAYMOND
               Annie.

               There is a dark spirit here that
               wants to destroy you.  Your
               salvation lies in the pages
               from the Book of the Dead.

      The ghost of Raymond points to Annie's glass case.

               I ain't got your hand, baby.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Then who...?

      Bobby Joe raises her hand into frame, to reveal Ash's
      Evil Hand clutched in hers.  Bobby Joe goes nuts,
      screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand
      from her.  She slams into the lantern, knocking it out.
      We lose them in the darkness.

                              JAKE'S VOICE
               Somebody get the light!

      She runs deep into the woods, still looking behind her
      as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its
      gnarled bark folds open to reveal very human like oversized
      eyes.  A large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping
      mouth dripping tree sap saliva.

               If she went out in those woods,
               she's not coming back.

               the Sky," who was prophesized to destroy
               this Evil.

                              ASH
               He didn't do a very good job.

      Annie reads through the pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

               She's dead by now.  With these pages
               we can...

      Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand.

                              JAKE
               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and
      Annie look on in horror.

      Jake halts his screaming.  He listens in the silence
      as possessed Ash juts up into the frame!  His eyes
      are bone white, his flesh, the pale color of the dead.
      His lips, black.  He bellows to the night!

      All is quiet outside, no sign of Possessed Ash or
      Jake, and then Possessed Ash is there, emerging from
      the darkness suddenly.  He raises his finger and
      points to Annie.  He speaks in the low garbled voice
      of a demon:

                              POSSESSED ASH
               JOIN US!

      the monster that is Ash emerges.  He heads toward the
      cabin and disappears in a bank of fog.

               Get the axe.  Kill it.  Kill it.

      Jake moans and dies.

509E  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ANNIE                             509E

      Annie enters the room.  She shudders from the

      upon the floor, and over to reveal the bashed out
      window and the curtains fluttering in the wind.


509F  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE                                   509F

      The NECKLACE of Linda.


517   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            517

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.


518   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               518

      As he slowly picks up the delicate silver necklace.
      He raises it to his face;

                              LINDA (V.O.)
               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      Ash raises his head and lets out a low, lamenting, and
      pitiful wail.  A man trapped in the shell of a beast,
      crying for the one he has lost.


520   MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH - 50% POSSESSED     520

      BLADDER EFX - 50 - 20% POSSESSED

      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The
      swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal.

                              ASH
               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.


526   CLOSER - ASH AND ANNIE                                526

                              ASH
               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      Ash pushes her away.  Annie falls to the floor.  She
      stands.

      Catching his wind for a moment.  Then rolls to the
      side as the axe again comes at him!  SLAM!  The head
      of the axe slices into the wall only a few inches from
      his head.


528   MED. SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                             528

               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH

               I'm fine.

               Then let's head down into that cellar...


529B  CLOSE SHOT - TRAP DOOR                                529B

               ...And carve ourselves a witch.

544   ASH'S HAND                                            544

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to
      his stump.

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS into Ash's face.

                              ASH
               Groovy.

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      In the foreground is the base of a large oak tree.  The
      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

               Did you find her?

      darkness beyond.  Ash enters.  Again he hears the slight
      sound, a gentle ticking.

      The ticking sound is coming from behind a hanging drape.

               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the
      remaining pages from the Book of the Dead.  Getting
      scared now, he backs into the cellar's front room.

      grab at Ash's ankles.

      quickly up into the main room from the cellar.  A
      flurry of moths about her.

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.

      He pulls the trigger.  BLAM!  Flame barks from the gun.

      As it seals shut, leaving only the blue sky and the
      sound of tweeting birds.  Ash's view of the serene sky
      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his

      stand directly over him.

      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.

                             THE END

      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               It was then that the dark spirits

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

      a rocking chair.

      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO

      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this
               earth.


13Y   REVERSE ACTION                                        13Y

      The milky eyed possessed figure of HENRIETTA jolts quickly
      into the frame, and shrieks in the voice of a demon!
      Raymond Knowby screams.  He drops the microphone.


13X   CLOSE SHOT - TAPE RECORDER                            13X

      ROUNDY-ROUNDY - CAMERA MOUNTED ATOP VAN

      CAMERA MOVING swiftly down a dark tunnel. A light
      at the end growing closer. The SOUND of AIR RUSHING
      BY. The Delta 88 Oldsmobile comes ROARING out of
      the tunnel with a BLAST of AIR, and the sound of
      loud rock and roll music.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It was one week later that a group
               of college students came to the cabin.


14A   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT                    14A

      The Delta 88 Oldsmobile parked out front.  Fog roars
      past the place.  We faintly hear waltz music from
      within.  The silhouette of a woman sweeps by the rear
      bedroom window.


14B   INT. CABIN - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT                     14B
      ASH AND LINDA

      LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in
      the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan
      State University" sweatshirt.  She hums melodically to
      the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a
      delicate silver necklace.


14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14C

      A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music
      on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash
      is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the
      melody with two fingers.

                              LINDA
               Ash, what's that you're playing?

                              ASH
               Our song.

      Ash begins to play faster.

      spin.


14E   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    14E

      Out of breath, hair tousled across her eyes, she
      stares deeply into Ash's eyes.  Her lips, parted,
      in a sensual manner.


14F   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      14F

      He returns her stare, lost in her beauty.  He pulls
      her close.

                              LINDA
               Ow!


14G   SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY                               14G

      And looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she
      wears about her neck.

      She looks from the necklace to Ash.

               I really love it.  I'll never take
               it off.

      They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the
      haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.

               It was in the cabin's cellar that they
               found the Professor's tape recorder,
               and the Book of the Dead.

      CAMERA tracks in toward the trap door.  It opens by
      itself as we move down the steps into the blackness.


15    MEDIUM SHOT - INT. CABIN CELLAR - NIGHT               15

      The CAMERA pans down from the blackness to Ash who
      finds a shotgun, Raymond Knowby's tape recorder,
      tapes, the Kandarian dagger and...


16    CLOSE SHOT                                            16

      The group of students sit about the fire as they listen
      to the tape recorder. Coming from the speaker is the voice
      of Raymond Knowby reciting the demon resurrection passage.

      to comfort her.  She nervously fingers the silver locket
      she wears about her neck.

      The cabin is in the distance.  In the foreground the
      earth begins to swell, then rips apart as a red glow
      emanates from beneath.  Something evil is being
      unleashed.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One by one, they fell to the possession
               of the dark spirits.

      ASH AND LINDA

      Possessed Linda is coming after Ash.  Ash back peddles,
      stumbles and falls.

      Ash buries Linda's headless body.  He jams a crude

      of lightning strikes.

      FINAL SHOT OF EVIL DEAD I

      We are racing forward.  We have taken the POV of
      an EVIL ENTITY as it glides with dark purpose through
      a section of woods. It approaches the rear door of the
      cabin.  The door is torn violently open.  The next door
      falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It
      jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of
      the cabin.  Ash is seen in the distance.  He is staggering
      away, his back to us as we race at him.  He turns suddenly
      towards CAMERA and screams.

      The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an
      extension. Ash is caught by an invisible grip.
      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the
      air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins
      tearing through the branches and smaller trees,
      clearing a path with his body.  He finally slams into
      a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked
      unconscious.

      He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us.
      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,
      his lips, jet black.  He is Possessed.  A bright edge of
      morning sunlight moves across his face.  He turns his
      beastly face skyward.

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the

      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.

      kicks up dust and gravel.

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted

      He is stunned at the sight.  His only escape, gone.
      He looks from the bridge to the West.

      seconds.

      To reveal Ash as he looks from the sunset, to the ruined
      bridge, to the road behind him.  He moves in halting
      steps, not knowing which way to turn.

      Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as
      he begins to scream, we CUT TO:

      As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain
      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to
      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it
      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      Looking through the windshield, as branches beat and
      smash themselves against the windshield, obscuring
      our vision of the "Road" ahead.  Our view suddenly
      clears, revealing a large tree that looms directly
      ahead.

      As he runs toward the cabin.  (Actually he is running
      in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly
      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the
      farther away from the cabin he gets.

      We race into the cabin, splintering the hall door
      which Ash had swung shut.  Ash retreats into the
      rear hallway, and swings the hallway door shut.  We race
      right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces
      as we glide forward.

      in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him
      as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and
      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin

      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that

      while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie
      Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she
      moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers
      emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie.

               father?

                              ED
               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap
      hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.

                              ED
               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view

      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.

      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.

      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      3 ANGLES

      As it leaps through the air and gracefully situates
      itself atop Linda's neck, she begins to spin, yet her
      head remains in place, never taking her eyes from Ash.
      With a sensual twirl and leap, she disappears into the
      evening mists.

      ASH'S POV - THRU WINDOW

      Linda swings sharply into frame, completing the spin
      of her dance immediately in front of Ash as the music
      abruptly halts.

                              LINDA
               DANCE WITH ME!

      Linda extends her dead arms towards Ash.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH

      As he screams himself awake.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
      him sitting in the rocking chair.  Ash halts his scream,
      getting control of himself.  He looks to the window that
      had blown open.


178   ASH'S POV - THE BOARDED WINDOW                        178

      Still boarded as though it had never been opened.

      Reassuring himself.

                              ASH
               That's all.  Just a crummy dr-

      Linda's decapitated head falls into frame and lands in
      Ash's hands.


180   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             180

      It opens its eyes and looks to Ash.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Hello lover, I came from the other
               side of your dream to dance with you.


181   CLOSER SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD (BACKWARD MOTION)          181

      A four foot long blackened tongue emerges from her mouth
      like a lashing serpent.


182   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - (BACKWARD MOTION)                 182

      The tongue enters Ash's frame and forces itself into
      Ash's mouth.  Screaming as he clutches at the head of his
      former love.  The tongue instantly retracts inside her
      head.


183   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             183

      As Ash staggers painfully around the side of the
      cabin and towards the work shed; Linda's head still
      clamped to his hand.


187   INT. WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash
      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.  It is a room
      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.


187A  MEDIUM SHOT - INT. WORK SHED - ASH                    187A

      As he places Linda's head within the vice and
      tightens it around her, then withdraws his hand.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Even now we have your darling Linda's
               soul!  She suffers in torment!


187B  CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               187B

      As it rips away an old tarp revealing the chalk
      outline of where a chainsaw once was.


187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the
      chainsaw.  Behind him, the door to the shed bursts
      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.


187D  MEDIUM SHOT                                           187D

      Ash grabs a large crowbar and swings it

187E  CLOSE SHOT                                            187E

      The crowbar hits the bottom of the blade with a
      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.


187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.


187G  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187G

      As he is splattered with black bile.  He reaches down.

      Linda's head.


187J  WIDE SHOT - ASH AND LINDA'S HEAD IN VICE              187J

      From the chainsaw, fumes of blue amoke.  Ash turns
      to the head and falters.


187K  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD IN VICE                     187K

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.


187L  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187L

      Trying to fight his feelings, he knows what he must
      do.  He pumps the throttle on the saw.


187M  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    187M

      Pleading with him.

                              LINDA
               You promised me we'd always be
               together.  You swore to me!


187N  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187N

      Agonized.

                              ASH
               NO!


187O  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             187O

      Once again fully possessed, and speaking in the voice
      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO
               LINDA! YOUR LOVE WAS A LIE!  AND
               NOW SHE BURNS IN HELL!

187Q  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187Q

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.


187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R

187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.


188   CRANE SHOT - EXT. WORK SHED - NIGHT                   188

      Ash in a confused state as he staggers from the
      work shed and towards the cabin.  Again clutching
      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.


189B  INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          189B

      Ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the
      sound.


189C  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV - THE ROCKING CHAIR     189C

      It rocks back and forth with a definitive motion,
      halting for a moment at it's pints furthest forward
      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

      He slowly approaches the chair, scared shitless.


189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...


191   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM/MIRROR ROOM - NIGHT              191
      MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - ASH AND REFLECTION

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.


192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192
      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.


197   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          197
      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      The hand picks up plates and begins breaking them over
      Ash's head.  Then a bottle.


209   MEDIUM SHOT                                           209

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.

      It digs its nails deep into the floorboards and begins to
      pull...


213   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     213

      ... as he is pulled along the kitchen floor.


214   CLOSE SHOT - HAND - GELETIN HAND                      214

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?


214A  ANGLE - ASH - COMEDY KNIFE RIG                        214A

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

      The CAMERA cranes down as Annie's car approaches from
      the distance. It pulls to a halt. Ed and Annie step
      from the car.


218   ANNIE'S POV                                           218

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE
               Excuse me.  This the road to the
               Knowby's cabin?

                              JAKE
               Thas' right.  But you ain't goin' there.

                              ANNIE
               And why not?


219   CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     219

      All stand in the bright glare of the lights as the fog

      wonder at what they see.

      The piercing beams of light illuminate twisted remnants of
      the destroyed bridge that leads to the cabin.  A road sign,
      similar to the one on the other side of the bridge
      reads: "Dangerous Bridge - Two Ton Weight Limit".

               What happened?

                              JAKE
               Lady, I ain't never seen nothin' like
               it.

                              ED
               Terrific.  Now what?

                              ANNIE
               There must be another way in.
               Another road or something.


224   JAKE, BOBBY JOE, ANNIE AND ED - TWO CAMERAS           224

                              BOBBY JOE
               Sure ain't no, road.

      CAMERA pans over to reveal a brassy southern spitfire
      of a woman, Bobby Joe.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Hell you wanna go there for, anyway?

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs
      it into her mouth.  She doesn't like Annie and her
      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.


224X  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE AND ED                            224X

      Annie steps forward.  She eyes Bobby Joe.

                              ANNIE
               None of your business.


224Y  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224Y

      He feigns surprise and pleasantness.

                              JAKE
               Hey!  I just remembered... Yeah,
               that's right... There is a trail.
               You could follow Bobby Joe and me.

                              ED
               That sounds all right.

                              JAKE
               But, it'll cost ya.

                              ANNIE

      Jake looks up suddenly at Bobby Joe who gives
      a sharp shake of her head.

                              JAKE
               Hundred bucks.


224B  CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    224B

224C  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224C

      He glances through the window of Annie's car.

      Looking back to Annie, a big smile on his near
      toothless face.

               Sure!

      A hiking trail winds through the woods.  Bobby Joe
      leads the way with flashlight in hand.  She pockets
      some bills.  She is followed by Annie and Ed who
      carry the glass case containing the missing pages
      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

                              JAKE
               Jesus H. Christ!  I thought she
               was talkin' 'bout them two goddamn
               little pieces!

      No longer attached to Ash's arm, it still writhes about
      beneath Ash's foot which pins it to the floor.


229   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - HAND'S POV - EYEMO W/ MOUNT       229

      As he grabs the steel wastebasket, dumps out the trash
      lowers it quickly over the CAMERA, trapping the hand
      within.


230   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     230

      With a note of finality, Ash slams down a pile of books
      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".


231   FIREPLACE                                             231

      Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been
      resting upon the coals.  He grits his teeth.


232   ANGLE                                                 232

      Just out of frame, Ash thrusts the glowing shovel against
      the stump to cauterize the wound.  Red steam hisses up
      into frame as Ash screams.


233   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     233

      He tosses aside the shovel and douses his smoldering
      stump into a vase of fresh flowers.


234   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      234

      He tapes the tablecloth into a makeshift bandage
      about his wrist.  Behind him, the wastebasket
      silently slides across the floor.

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its

259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.

      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

      Ash leaps down upon the trapdoor, slamming it to pin

      her back down into the cellar. The trap door shuts.
      Ash leaps atop it. The sound of Henrietta falling down
      the cellar steps is heard along with the beast's wild
      ravings.  Ash quickly threads the chains through the

               I fear that whatever I have

               to come calling for me.

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.

               Let me out, dear.  It's so cold and dark
               in here.

                              ANNIE
               Mother?

      her gently.  He shakes his head.  Annie snaps out of
      it.  She shakes her head and looks to the cellar.

                              ANNIE
               No.  No.  I don't know what you
               are but you're not my mother.

               No!

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

      Jake slowly stands into the empty frame. He is in shock
      from what he has just seen.  Annie slowly rises into
      frame - shaking her head in a silent "No." Ash slowly
      rises into frame, terrified. They are looking down at
      the out-of-frame remains of possessed Ed.

390A  MAIN ROOM NIGHT - ASH, JAKE, BOBBY JOE AND ANNIE      390A

      Jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room.
      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

      Jake moves to the window and looks out.

               That's funny.

                              BOBBY JOE
               What?

                              JAKE
               That trail we came in here on...
               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      disengages herself from Ash.  They hear a sound coming
      from the middle bedroom.

      Evil Hand clutched in hers.  Bobby Joe goes nuts,
      screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand
      from her.  She slams into the lantern, knocking it out.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its

               her!

                              ASH
               If she went out in those woods,
               she's not coming back.

      Jake turns back to the window.  Ash turns to Annie.
      He glances down at the pages that Annie is looking over.


445A  ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT - PAGES AND ANNIE              445A

      One of the pages is a clear pictorial of Ash as the
      "Hero from the Sky."


445B  ASH AND ANNIE                                         445B

      Ash shudders.

                              ANNIE
               What is it?

                              ASH
               Felt like someone just walked over my
               grave.  It's that picture.

      Annie looks to it.

                              ANNIE
               In 1300 AD.  This was the "Hero from
               the Sky," who was prophesized to destroy
               this Evil.

                              ASH
               He didn't do a very good job.
               What about the passages?


446   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    446

      As she quickly gives the pages a cursory glance.

                              ANNIE
               Here it is.  Two passages.

      For the first time, she smiles at Ash.

                              ANNIE
               We've got it!

447A  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                           447A

      Annie reads through the pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

      the shotgun.  He points it at Ash and Annie.

               find her, we're gettin' the hell
               outta here.

                              ASH
               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

                              JAKE
               You two comin' with me.  I ain't goin'
               out there alone.

                              ASH
               NO, YOU IDIOT.  You'll kill us all.
               She's dead by now.  With these pages
               we can...

      Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand.

                              JAKE
               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and
      Annie look on in horror.

                              JAKE
               'Sides.  Now you ain't got no, choice.

      Jake pushes at Ash with the barrel of the shotgun.

                              JAKE
               Now move!

      Ash hesitates.

                              JAKE
               Move you son of a bitch!

      Jake, and then Possessed Ash is there, emerging from
      the darkness suddenly.  He raises his finger and
      points to Annie.  He speaks in the low garbled voice
      of a demon:

514   ASH'S POV - STAR FILTER - MIRROR NECKLACE             514

      As he moves closer to her unmoving body.  A glitter of
      light on the floor, next to her, catches his eye.


515   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            515

      For the first time, calm, as he looks intently down at

      The NECKLACE of Linda.


517   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            517

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.


518   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               518

      As he slowly picks up the delicate silver necklace.
      He raises it to his face;

                              LINDA (V.O.)
               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      Ash raises his head and lets out a low, lamenting, and
      pitiful wail.  A man trapped in the shell of a beast,
      crying for the one he has lost.


520   MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH - 50% POSSESSED     520

      BLADDER EFX - 50 - 20% POSSESSED

      His face begins to change.  His skin loses its white
      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The
      swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal.

      EXPLODING FLOOR

      As he rolls out of the way a moment before the head of
      the axe buries itself in the wooden floor.  Splinters
      fly.


525   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                   525
      EXPLODING WALL EFX

      Rolls to his feet and stands.  He ducks as Annie
      enters frame, charging him with axe, screaming.

                              ASH
               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.


526   CLOSER - ASH AND ANNIE                                526

      Ash grabs her tightly with his remaining hand.

                              ASH
               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      Ash pushes her away.  Annie falls to the floor.  She
      stands.


527   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                    527
      EXPLODING WALL EFX

      Catching his wind for a moment.  Then rolls to the
      side as the axe again comes at him!  SLAM!  The head
      of the axe slices into the wall only a few inches from
      his head.


528   MED. SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                             528

      As he grabs Annie by the face and forces her
      backwards.

                              ASH
               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH
               You'll be the first to know.
               I'm fine.


529   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE AND ASH                            529

               Yeah, but for how long?
               If we're going to beat this thing,
               we need those pages.


529A  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      529A

      As he turns to the trap door.

                              ASH
               Then let's head down into that cellar...


529B  CLOSE SHOT - TRAP DOOR                                529B

      It lies silently against the floor.  A rasping
      breath can be heard from below.


529C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      529C

      He turns from the trap door to Annie.

                         ASH
               ...And carve ourselves a witch.


530   EXT. WORKSHED - NIGHT                                 530

534   WORKSHED TABLE                                        534

      holes in it with a battery powered drill.

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to
      his stump.


545   CLOSER SHOT                                           545

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS into Ash's face.

                              ASH

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      In the foreground is the base of a large oak tree.  The
      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the
      remaining pages from the Book of the Dead.  Getting

      As she kneels down at the trapdoor, about to call down
      to Ash when the witchlike figure of Henrietta floats
      quickly up into the main room from the cellar.  A
      flurry of moths about her.

      As the pee wee Head transformation continues, Henrietta's

      a solid five feet upward, so that her head is now
      looking down upon Ash baring its teeth.

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.


605   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    605

                              ASH
               Swallow this.

      He pulls the trigger.  BLAM!  Flame barks from the gun.

      and Annie stagger for footing.

      on the surface of a giant oak is revealed, as it peeks
      in through the window at them.

      head.  It's massive jaw jutts from the head, biting
      and snapping.  Sap-like saliva drips from the orifice.
      Ash's feet kick at the mouth of rotten apple head,
      trying to keep it away.  Its jaws snap at his shoes.


645A  C.U. - ASH'S FEET - PUSHING AT THE GUMS OF            645A
      RAH'S MOUTH.

      SNAP! The massive teeth snap together biting Ash's
      foot in half.


645B  C.U. ASH                                              645B

      He screams, then looks down to his foot.


645C  C.U. ASH'S FOOT - (OVERLARGE SHOE)                    645C

      Missing the leather toe section, he reveals that
      he still has his toes intact.


646   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      646

      As he sharply jerks his arm outward!  The CHAINSAW
      ROARS to life!  He raises it high above his head and
      plunges it forward.


647   WIDE SHOT - ASH AND ROTTEN APPLE HEAD                 647

      Ash thrusts the spinning chainsaw blade into the single
      eye of the beast.

      WIDE SHOT

      As rotten apple head is sucked out the doorway of the
      cabin.  The door slams shut behind it.  Its scream
      echoes off into the distance.

655   MED. SHOT                                             655

      The cabin becomes much more quiet.  The sounds of the
      trees are gone.  Ash looks to Annie.  She is dead.  Ash
      moves to her, strokes her hair and begins to cry.

                              ASH
                You did it.  By God you did it.

      He lowers his head and begins to heave in sharp
      convulsive breaths of despair.

      Behind Ash the front door RIPS open with a TREMENDOUS
      BLAST.  The door is sucked down into the rift.  All
      of the objects in the room are sucked through the open
      doorway and down into the rift, including the pages
      of the Book of the Dead.

      Ash grabs ahold of the kitchen window ledge so as not
      to be swept outside by the force of the vacuum of the
      rift.  Objects and papers fly past him.


664   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               664

      Objects continue to fly past on wires.

      We are now within the vortex.  A swirling mass of colors
      and clouds.  And nightmarish sound effects.

      Objects come AT US from the distance and roar past, an
      uprooted tree, the grandfather clock with its hands
      winding backwards at an incredible rate, Ash spinning
      AT US, hand over foot, screaming.  The chainsaw still
      mounted to his wrist.

      Oldsmobile and the old grandfather clock.

      As it seals shut, leaving only the blue sky and the
      sound of tweeting birds.  Ash's view of the serene sky
      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his
      line of sight.  Five armor-clad medieval WARRIORS
      stand directly over him.

      and poises it above Ash's head.

                              WARRIOR #1

      A "WINGED DEADITE," a female harpy like creature with

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.

                             THE END

     FADE INTO:

     SEPIA-TONE FOOTAGE

     of a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an
     elephant.  Noah's Ark going round... and round... and
     round...


     EXT. GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY

     Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and
     fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal:

     JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus.  On the adjacent
     unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5).  Clutching a balloon,
     Matty waves at his dad.  A happy moment, like so many
     certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching
     them THROUGH...


     SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES

     wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the
     target.  They round the bend and disappear...


     MATTHEW

     Loses his grip on the unicorn.  Archer reaches over and
     pulls him into his lap.  They happily ride together...

     As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer...

     Now we see the sniper.  CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient,
     aggressive, sexual.  His finger closes around the
     trigger.

     BOOM!  A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back.  Bleeding... he
     drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the
     carousel.  His eyes desperately searching... searching...
     searching... until he sees --

     Matthew lies on his back -- still.  Slowly, Archer
     reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see
     COLOR for the first time...

     Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son...

     TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full
     color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating
     away.

     HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS:


     FBI BRIEFING ROOM

     Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below
     is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his
     eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession.


     CAROUSEL HORSE

     sweeps by, as if marking time itself...


     HOLY PLACE

     Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden
     cross.  A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer.  The
     glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a
     light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb.  This
     is no chapel... but an atrium.  Somewhere.

     And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's
     Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device.


     ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE

     sweeps by...


     ARCHER

     pockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun...


     CASTOR

     sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in
     front of it.  Totally hidden.


     BRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT

     is on a computer screen.  His criminal dossier scrolls by
     endlessly:  bombings, assassinations, mercenary
     kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire...

     Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully.  Other
     agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid-
     maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and
     coffee cups.  These people are on high alert.

                             ARCHER
               Any follow-up from L.A.P.D.
               Intelligence?

                             BUZZ
               No, sir, nothing yet.

                             ARCHER
               Get them on the phone -- now.
               What about S.I.S. and our airport
               teams?

                             WANDA
               We've had everything from psychics
               to satellites on this.  Even if
               Castor was here... he must have
               slipped the net by now...

                             ARCHER
               He's here!  And we're going to
               keep looking until we find him!

     A silence descends on the chastised team.  As they go
     back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer
     aside.

                             TITO
               Jon, these people have been
               working round the clock -- you
               gotta cut them some slack...

     Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then...

                             ARCHER
               I'll cut them some slack when I
               cut myself some slack.

     Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him.


     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MORNING)

     Castor quietly shuts the security door behind him.  An
     Hispanic voice startles him.

                             JANITOR
               What are you doing?

                             CASTOR
                      (in perfect Spanish)
               Thank goodness, I feel like Icarus
               in the labyrinth -- where's the
               men's room?

                             JANITOR
                      (in Spanish)
               This area is off limits, Padre.
                      (re:  security door)
               How did you get in that room?

     Realizing the JANITOR is already too suspicious, Castor
     puts a priestly arm around him -- and leads him down the
     hall.

                             CASTOR
               Okay... I have a confession to
               make, but you aren't gonna like
               it.  I was planting a bomb.

                             JANITOR
               Bomb?

                             CASTOR
               You know -- boom --
                      (patting his
                       neck)
               Oh, never mind...

     The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his
     head.  As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a
     stairwell.  Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in
     Castor's hand.

     Castor kicks the Janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs
     -- making everything look like an accident.


     INT. SAME BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - DAY (MORNING)

     The children's church choir -- 200 strong -- sing "Behold
     the Lamb of God."  Clergy and lay persons listen
     reverently.

     "Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually
     heading for the exit.  As he passes the risers, a teenage
     girl drops her sheet music at his feet.

     Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's
     practically licking it.

                             CASTOR
               I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.'
               But your voice makes even a hack
               like Handel seem like a genius.

     He pats her behind and leaves.  Although a little shaken,
     she's also drawn by Castor's sexual magnetism.


     EXT. LA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY (MORNING)

     The marquee proclaims:  INTERNATIONAL CHURCH CHOIRS 18th-
     21st:  AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.

     Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop.


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY (MORNING)

     The office is a monument to obsession:  photographs,
     clues, newsclips, totems of Castor Troy surround a pacing
     Archer.

                             ARCHER
                      (on phone)
               ... I don't have time to get a
               warrant from some hung-over judge.
               Just give me the go-ahead, Victor,
               and I promise -- as soon as this
               is over -- you can brand my butt
               with the Fourth Amendment.

     The instant Archer hangs up -- the INTERCOM BUZZES.

                             KIM (V.O.)
               Sir, your wife's on line one...
               S.I.S. on two...

                             ARCHER
               Tell her to hang on --

     As Archer punches up line two -- Tito bursts in.

                             TITO
               A jet was chartered at Anderson
               Airfield.  Guess who just showed
               up to pay for it?  Pollux Troy.

                             ARCHER
               Scramble the Reaction Team --
               we're moving out.  And get one of
               our people on that plane.

                             TITO
               But there's still no sign of
               Castor...

                             ARCHER
               Where one brother goes, the
               other's sure to follow...

     They rush our... the hold button on line 1 still
     blinking.


     EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     A sleek Cadillac pulls in... stopping next to a Land
     Rover.

     LARS MUELLER -- a muscular, crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets
     out of the Caddy.  An instant later -- LUNT MUELLER --
     emerges from the Rover.  They are identical twins.

     The men scan the airport carefully, then open the rear
     doors of their respective vehicles.  Castor emerges from
     the Caddy -- Armani clad.

     Exiting the Rover is Castor's younger brother POLLUX TROY
     -- skittish, brilliant, paranoid -- a human hummingbird.

                             POLLUX
               You're 26 minutes late.  The
               casing didn't fit -- right?  I
               knew that cheap-shit Dietrich
               would rip us off...

                             CASTOR
               Oh, God -- !

                             POLLUX
               What!?

                             CASTOR
               I forgot to turn the damn thing
               on!

                              POLLUX
               You're kidding, right?
                      (to the twins)
               He's kidding...
                      (grabs Castor
                       by throat)
               ... are you fucking kidding!?

     Castor hugs Pollux lovingly.  Pollux squirms like a kid.

                             CASTOR
               Bro -- everything went fine.

                             POLLUX
               I hate when you call me bro.

     Pollux heads for the jet.  Castor hands Lunt a wad of
     cash.

                             CASTOR
               Thanks for babysitting.

                             LUNT
               Anything else?

                             CASTOR
               I'll contact you when we get the
               rest of the money.
                      (turns to leave)
               Oh, and stat away from downtown.
               The inversion layer's going to be
               pretty thick around the 18th.

     The twins nod... then take off.  Castor heads for the
     jet.


     INT. JET - DAY

     Castor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT.

                             CASTOR
               Let's go, let's go!

     As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his
     seat.  A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him
     a Scotch.  He downs it, looking her over salaciously.

                             FLIGHT ATTENDANT
               Would you like anything else?

                             CASTOR
               Hell, yes...
                      (pulls her into lap)
               It's the only way to fly.

     She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its
     taxi down the runway.


     COCKPIT

     Castor yanks open the door.

                             CASTOR
               What's wrong?


     AT END OF RUNWAY

     A squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway.


     EXT./INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

     Behind the wheel is Jon Archer.  Beside him is Tito.


     BACK TO ARCHER

                             CASTOR
               It's Archer.
                      (gun to Pilot's
                       head)
               Go, dammit!

     Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand.  he turns
     around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them --
     holding a smoking pistol.  This is Agent WINTERS.

                             WINTERS
               F.B.I.!  Throttle down, captain!

     But Castor elbows the throttle up.  The jet lurches
     forward, throwing Winters off balance.  Pollux tackles
     her as the jet picks up speed.


     INT. HUMVEE - DAY

     Archer slams the vehicle into gear.

                             ARCHER
               Get out.

                             TITO
               You're not playing chicken with
               two tons of aluminum...

                             ARCHER
               Get out!

     Tito obeys as Archer peels out.  The HUMMER ROARS at the
     jet.

     The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft.

     The humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow.


     COLLISION COURSE

     as two hunks of metal bear down.  The machines are
     seconds apart when --

     Archer looks up to see...

     Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window,
     Castor holding a gun to her head.

     Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet.  The
     Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but 
     too late.  Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a 
     swirl of dust.

     As the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens.  Castor
     blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the
     tarmac.


     INSIDE

     Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until...

     KA-CHUNK:  Something POUNDS the jet -- from above.
     Castor leans out the hatch and sees...

     The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls.

     Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men.

     Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch.

     The chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs.  Archer jerks
     and weaves -- dodging the BULLETS.  The chopper pulls
     away.

     The jet finally lifts off... when...

     The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail.


     TARMAC

     Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a 
     deadly game of leap-frog with the jet.

     The end of the runway is coming up fast.

     Archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap.


     JET PILOT

     can't budge the jet's jammed yoke.  Thwarted, he powers
     back the throttle.  Thrust reverse.

                             CASTOR
               What are you doing?

                             PILOT
               The horizontal elevator's smashed!
               We can't lift off!


     CASTOR

     SHOOTS the Pilot -- then takes the controls.  He
     struggles to maneuver the jet.  Suddenly...

     A biplane descends right at them -- about to land.


     ARCHER

     pulls up just as the JET swerves radically to avoid the
     biplane and SLAMS into the hangar.


     JET

     plows through the GLASS DOOR, the NOSE-WHEEL SNAPS off.
     The PLANE SKIDS right into the hangar -- finally stopping
     at the wings.


     FBI CHOPPER

     lands.  Archer steps out calmly -- like a cop about to 
     write a traffic ticket.  He hurries to join more FBI 
     agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him.


     INT. HANGAR - DAY

     The jet hatch pops open -- Castor leaps from it, FIRING.

     Two FBI agents drop -- riddled.

     Pollux appears at the hatch -- an FBI sharpshooter FIRES,
     grazing Pollux's shoulder.  Staggered, Pollux falls --

     Castor catches him before he hits the floor --
     simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter.

     Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar.

     Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his
     anger building.  He signals Tito and the others to spread
     out.


     DEEP IN HANGAR

     A maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery.  Led by
     Archer, the FBI agents pick their way through it.

     ROOKIE LOOMIS snaps alert -- did he see something?
     Advancing carefully, he comes up on...

     Castor -- staunching Pollux's shoulder wound.  Pollux
     sees the agent -- and FIRES.

     Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded.

     Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux.

     Tito is at the wheel.  Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to
     dive off.  The forklift careens on -- driving apart the
     brothers.

     The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning
     Pollux.  Castor tries to free his trapped brother.

                             POLLUX
               Forget it -- Go!  Go!

     He slaps his Glock into Pollux's hand.

                             CASTOR
               Wherever they put you, I'll find a
               way to get you out...

     Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs
     through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar.

     Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's
     head.  As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand.

                             TITO
               -- not unless you want that 200
               I.Q. splattered all over the
               floor.
                      (as Archer
                       approaches)
               We got him now, Jon.

                             ARCHER
               That's what you always say.  Seal
               it off.  I'm going in.

     Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel.

     MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse
     dance.

     Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear.  He
     draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on.

     Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy
     movements mirroring Castor's.

     Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze
     trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers.
     The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in.

     Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering
     the challenge.  As the deadly beat between them
     continues --

     BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS
     FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead.

     INTERCUT as necessary:

                             CASTOR
               Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed
               by your obsessive need to spoil my
               fun.

                             ARCHER
               And how much will your 'fun' net
               you this time?

     BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning.
     A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP!  He fits a new
     CLIP into his pistol.

                             CASTOR
               What's it to you?  I declare it.
               Here I am, back in the States for
               less than a week --

                             ARCHER
               You're under arrest.  Incredibly,
               you still have the right to remain
               silent --

                             CASTOR
               I've got something going down on
               the eighteenth... it's gonna be
               worse than anything God ever
               dumped on the Pharaoh.  I'll give
               it up -- but my brother and I have
               to walk.

                             ARCHER
               No discussion -- no deals.

                             CASTOR
               What're you gonna do with me
               locked up?  You'll drive your wife
               and kid nuts!  I bet your daughter
               is just about ripe by now.  What's
               her name, Janie?

     Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw
     his enemy out.  Silence -- then Archer senses...

     Castor is behind him.  He FIRES -- Archer dives away.
     The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two
     huge turbine engines.  As Archer reloads, he stares at
     the control panel switches.

     Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP-
     SNAP.  Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two
     switches.

     VRRRROOOM!  The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on!  Unable to fight
     the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted
     across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall.

     The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito.

                             TITO
               Tell me he didn't get away
               again...

     Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless
     body.  Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile
     survives.


     EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET

     Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded
     into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda.

                             POLLUX
               Where's my brother?!  I want to
               see my brother!

     The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, 
     flanked by two bodyguards.  Bullying through the media,
     Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the
     devastation.

     Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded
     on the ambulance.  A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face.

                             LAZARRO
               The oversight committee would've
               roasted us for this one -- thank
               God it paid off.  Damn fine work.

                             ARCHER
               Real fine, Victor.  Especially the
               casualties.

     Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three
     bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked.
     Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the
     bodies.

     Instinctively, the two men close ranks.  Archer grabs the
     Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.

                             LAZARRO
               Classified information.  No
               photographs.

     Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and
     leads him away from the media... and the carnage.

                             LAZARRO
               You okay, Jon?
                      (off Archer's nod)
               Then go home.  Tell Eve.


     EXT.  ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET

     A renovated Craftsman.  Sipping a carton of milk, Archer
     pulls into the driveway.  He sits, gathering his
     thoughts.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT

     Archer enters and sees his wife EVE.  Handsome,
     intelligent.

                             ARCHER
               Hi...
                      (no response)
               ... What's wrong?

     She nods toward the KITCHEN.  JAMIE is there -- a sullen 
     and hard fifteen-year-old.  There are cigarette cartons
     on the table.

                             EVE
               She complimented for her 'F' in
               history with an 'A' in
               shoplifting...

     Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of
     Marlboros.  Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee.

                             ARCHER
               Nice stunt, Jamie.  You break the
               law and I'm expected to ignore it?

                             JAMIE
               That's right -- it's all about
               you.  Don't even ask me what
               happened.

     Archer looks to Eve for help.  Eve shakes her head --
     nope.

                             ARCHER
               Okay.  What happened?

                             JAMIE
               Like you'd ever fucking believe
               me!

     She bolts.  In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as
     Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her.

                             EVE
               Well, you tried.  You failed
               miserably, but you tried.

                             ARCHER
               Why won't she even talk to me?

                             EVE
               Maybe because you taught her never
               to speak to strangers.
                      (immediately
                       regrets it)
               I'm sorry... that wasn't fair.

     Eve kisses his cheek -- then gathers up her doctor gear.

                             EVE
               I've got patients waiting.  Try
               again, Jon.  She hates you -- but
               she needs you.

                             ARCHER
               Eve...

     Something in Archer's expression makes her stop.

                             EVE
               Jon -- what is it?

     But he's too overcome.  He starts to speak -- but can't.

                             EVE
               Is it -- him?  It's... it's over?

     Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks 
     up.  Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them 
     both.

                             ARCHER
               I'm going to make everything up to
               you and Jamie.  I'll put in for a
               desk job.  We'll go away, get
               counseling -- anything you want.
               This time, I mean it.


     INT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

     Freshly dressed, Archer heads down the hall.  He pauses 
     at the door to Jamie's room when he sees -- Jamie.

     Fully clothed, she's fast asleep on her bed cluttered
     with clothes and assorted girl-stuff.  Her face peaceful.

     Archer looks around her room... sees the stuffed animals 
     collecting dust... replaced by makeup, jewelry, beefcake
     Calvin Klein ads and band posters, etc.

     Archer's startled to see a lacey bustier... his little 
     girl is growing up fast.  And he's missing it.

     He pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out.
     The instant he leaves, Jamie kicks the blankets off.


     INT. FBI BUILDING - DAY

     Dominated by the FBI seal.  Archer steps to the check
     point.

                             SECURITY GUARD
               Print, please.

     Archer presses his thumb to a scan-pad -- and is cleared.


     INT.  BULL PEN - DAY

     Efficient as a beehive -- agents, cryptologists, support 
     staff buzz at their routines.  Archer strides through -- 
     drawing congratulatory nods and "thumbs up" signs...


     OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE

     Archer's team is there.  Applauding.  Proud.  Uneasy with 
     plaudits, he disperses the disappointed agents.

                             ARCHER
               Much appreciated.  Now let's get
               back to work, okay?

                             WANDA
                      (to Buzz)
               Is that stick ever gonna fall out
               of his ass?

     Archer's well-built secretary -- KIM BREWSTER -- hands
     him his messages.  She's holding a bottle of Dom
     Perignon.

                             KIMBERLY
               The C.I.A. sent this over.  What
               should I do with it?

                             ARCHER
               Send it back and tell them to stop
               wasting the taxpayers' money.
               Anything else, Miss Brewster?

                             KIMBERLY
               No, sir.

     He enters his office.  Kimberly sighs and turns to Wanda.

                             KIMBERLY
               Four years -- and he still calls
               me 'Miss Brewster.'


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Sitting at his computer -- Archer scrolls through
     Castor's file.  He grimly contemplates face-after-face of
     Troy's victims -- finally pausing on a photo of his son
     Matthew.

     Burying his feeling, he types "CASE CLOSED" over
     Castor's image.  Archer starts to press "enter" when Tito
     comes in.

                             ARCHER
               How's Loomis?

                             TITO
               He needs some surgery, but he's
               going to be okay.  That's the good
               news...

                             ARCHER
               Go on.

                             TITO
               ... Brodie and Miller from Special
               Ops need to see you.

                             ARCHER
               I don't have time for those cloak
               and dagger guys.

     Big NED BRODIE and athletic female HOLLIS MILLER stroll
     in.

                             BRODIE
               You better make time, Jon.
                      (hefts a disc)
               We found this in the jet wreckage
               -- among Pollux Troy's effects...

     Archer accedes as Miller pops in the disk.  The computer
     screen displays a CAD schematic of the bomb.  Archer
     studies it carefully -- unease growing.

                             ARCHER
               Porcelain casing... Thermal
               cloak... Undetectable payload.

                             MILLER
               Powerful enough to flatten ten
               city blocks.

                             ARCHER
               'Worse than anything God ever
               dumped on the Pharaohs.'
                      (to Tito)
               Get Pollux Troy.  Now.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INTERROGATION FOOTAGE

     Wired to a complex machine -- Pollux seems to have his
     frustrated interrogators on the run.


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Archer, Lazarro, Tito, Brodie, Miller and other FBI
     officials watch the monitor.  Pollux remains implacable

                             POLLUX (V.O.)
                      (on screen)
               That bomb was just a crossword
               puzzle to me... a mental exercise.
               I never built it...

     Lazarro shuts down the monitor... turns to Archer.

                             ARCHER
               He's lying.

                             LAZARRO
               He's hooked up to a full-spectrum
               polygraph.

                             ARCHER
               Pollux is a manipulative
               psychopath.  He can control his
               heartbeat, his sweat glands, his
               blood pressure...

                             LAZARRO
               Jon, I trust your instincts, I
               always have.  But D.C. wants more
               evidence.  And frankly, so do I.

                             ARCHER
               You'll get all the evidence you
               need when ten thousand people die.

                             LAZARRO
               We'll get a team right on it.  But
               we can't evacuate the city on what
               amounts to a hunch.

     Archer looks at the gathered brass.  He knows it's 
     hopeless.

                             ARCHER
               That bomb has been built, it's out
               there somewhere and it's going to
               detonate...


     EXT. FBI BUILDING - INTELLIGENCE MEMORIAL - DAY

     Words etched in the granite wall read:

                     IN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS
               OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
                     WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES
                        IN THE LINE OF DUTY

     Archer watches as a workman engraves the last of the
     three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring
     the dead.

                             BRODIE
               Didn't Castor give any clue where
               the bomb might be?

                             ARCHER
               Only one person knows -- his
               brother Pollux.  And he'll keep
               his mouth shut until it blows.

                             BRODIE
               We could plant an agent in his
               cell -- get him to spill the
               location.

                             ARCHER
               Pollux is way too paranoid.  The
               only person he'd talk to about
               that bomb is Castor himself.  And
               dead men can't talk.

     Brodie and Miller exchange a knowing look.

                             BRODIE
               There might be a way around
               that...


     FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S BODY

     Tubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice.


     INT. ICU ROOM - DAY

     Archer stares at the body... he can't believe it.

                             ARCHER
               Why are you keeping him alive?
                      (gets no answer)
               As long as he's breathing, he's
               dangerous.

                             MILLER
               Relax, he's a turnip.

     Miller grinds out her cigarette on Castor's leg.  Of
     course, Castor just lies there like a vegetable.

                             BRODIE
               We can arrange for you to enter
               Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy.

                             ARCHER
               What are you talking about?

     Archer turns as DR. MALCOLM HOAG (50s) enters the room.

                             HOAG
               I think I'd better answer that
               question.
                      (offers hand)
               Malcolm Hoag.  I run the
               Physiological Camouflage Unit for
               Special Ops.

                             ARCHER
               I know who you are.

                             MILLER
               But you don't know what he can do.
               Physical augmentation; enhancement
               surgery...

                             BRODIE
               ... He can disguise a compromised
               agent or alter the likeness --
               even the voice -- of a government
               witness.

                             HOAG
               Let me show you how it's done.
                      (leading him out)
               I think you'll recognize our
               patient...


     INT. HOAG'S SURGICAL BAY - DAY

     Loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away
     charred flesh around his burned ear.  The doctor turns to
     a --


     STEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE

     Laser-beams attack an organic soup with incredible
     precision.  The light forces a chemical reaction -- and 
     out of the soup -- an ear begins to form.  It rises from 
     the liquid, now fully-formed.  The surgeon takes the ear 
     and fits it in place on Loomis's head.  He starts 
     suturing.


     OBSERVATION BOOTH - ABOVE

     Archer, Hoag, Brodie and Miller watch the operation --
     video-enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls.

                             HOAG
               With our new generation of anti-
               inflammatories, healing is
               accelerated from weeks to days.
               By his next paycheck, he won't
               even remember which ear he lost.
                      (a beat)
               Your situation, however, would be
               a little less permanent...

                             BRODIE
               -- and a lot more classified.

     Hoag holds up a face-sized organic shell made up of
     yellow cartilage pieces and tendons, etc.  Archer pulls
     it over his face -- like a gauze mask.  A "tendon" falls
     off.

                             ARCHER
               This'll fool Pollux.

                             HOAG
               That is a state-of-the-art morpho-
               genetic template.  The inside can
               be built to match the exact shape
               of your skull; the outside --
               exactly like Castor's.  Then we
               fit his face right on top --

                             MILLER
               -- and you become him.

                             ARCHER
               You're talking about removing the
               guy's face?

                             BRODIE
               Borrowing, Jon.  The procedure's
               completely reversible.

                             MILLER
               One way or the other -- the
               mission ends on the eighteenth.

     Archer turns the shell over and over and over in his
     hands.

                             BRODIE
               You know Castor better than
               anyone.  You've lived and breathed
               him for years -- hell, you even
               look a little like him.

     Archer shoves the template back at Hoag.

                             ARCHER
               Find yourself another lab-rat.

                             MILLER
               If you don't do this -- Castor
               will beat us again.  He'll beat
               you again...

     Archer pushes his way past them -- and marches out.

                             HOAG
               I don't think that went very well.

                             BRODIE
               Trust us, Doc...

                             MILLER
               ... he'll jerk around.  Then he'll
               be back.


     INT. INTERROGATION BOOTHS - DAY

     Archer enters... sizes up DIETRICH HASSLER.  His stylish
     garb doesn't completely hide his criminal roots.  Archer
     sits down calmly.  He looks at his watch.

                             ARCHER
               I'm in a hurry, Dietrich.  So
               you've only got ten seconds to go
               through your usual litany of lies,
               empty threats, and moronic
               denials.  Then I'm coming over
               there --

                             DIETRICH
               If you're in such a fucking hurry
               -- why are you wasting your time
               with me?  I'm just an art dealer.

                             ARCHER
               You're a dealer, all right:
               technical secrets, munitions...
               explosives.

                             DIETRICH
               You've never proven any of that.
               And when my bitchy, never-been-
               laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here,
               she's going to...

                             ARCHER
               Time's up.

     Archer topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the
     top.  Brandishing it -- he stalks the startled thug.


     HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Lazarro blanches as an obsessed Archer repeatedly slams
     the table leg against the wall -- above Dietrich's head.

                             LAZARRO
               The only ticking bomb I see is
               inside his head.  He's getting
               worse, Tito.

                             TITO
               Don't worry, sir.  It's all an
               act...

     But as Lazarro leaves -- we see Tito's worried, too.


     BACK INSIDE BOOTH

     Archer has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner.

                             DIETRICH
               ... Okay!  Castor called me but I
               blew him off... I swear I never
               saw him.  And I don't know
               anything about any bomb!


     INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION BOOTHS - SAME TIME

     Archer emerges... eyes blazing.

                             ARCHER
               Let him go, but I want him
               watched... Who's next?

                             TITO
               Just Dietrich's sister...

     In another booth, a careworn but striking woman sits with
     a little boy on her lap.  She gently helps him Crayola a
     book.  This is SASHA HASSLER (30) and her son ADAM (5).


     INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

     Archer hovers over Sasha -- her maternal warmth replaced
     by an icy hatred.  Tito and the child are gone.

                             ARCHER
               When was the last time you saw
               Castor Troy?

                             SASHA
               Who cares?  He's dead.

                             ARCHER
               Answer the question.

                             SASHA
               Look, I'm clean.  I teach kids
               now --

                             ARCHER
               Sasha -- you are a felon, on
               probation for harboring Castor
               Troy.  So it's in your best
               interest to cooperate.
                      (as she's silent)
               Would you like your son put in a
               foster home?

     Sasha's eyes flash, her body coils -- but she keeps
     control.

                             SASHA
               No, but I'm sure you'd love it --
               you sick bastard.

                             ARCHER
                      (unmoved)
               When was the last time you saw
               Castor Troy?

     She stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred.

                             SASHA
               I haven't seen him for years.


     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Archer watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into 
     Sasha's arms.  She hugs him protectively.  Adam sees
     Archer watching them -- and smiles.  Archer doesn't smile
     back.


     FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S REAL FACE

     PULL BACK TO:


     INT. I.C.U. - NIGHT

     Archer slowly circles Castor's muscular, hairy, tattooed
     body.  Although on life support -- his signature smirk
     remains.

                             ARCHER
               What about Lazarro?

                             BRODIE
               No way -- the red tape alone would
               take a month.  This is a black-bag
               operation -- completely off the
               books.

                             MILLER
               If you need him, Tito can help you
               prepare.  But you know the drill:
               You can't tell anyone -- not the
               Director, not your wife... nobody.

     Archer's face shows he doesn't like it -- then he nods.

                             ARCHER
               I'm in.


     EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

     Archer slowly gets out of his car.  Trudging toward the
     front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot.
     His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile.


     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Archer passes Jamie's room.  Loud MUSIC POUNDS from 
     within.  He pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads
     down the hall.


     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Eve is in bed.  Archer comes in quietly and sits beside 
     her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face.  She stirs.

                             EVE
               I was dreaming...

                             ARCHER
               Something good?

                             EVE
               I'm not sure... you were flying
               this weird old stunt plane...
               doing flips... walking on the
               wings... I was watching from the
               ground -- when you fell.  You had
               a parachute, but you wouldn't open
               it.

                             ARCHER
               Did you catch me?

                             EVE
               No.

                             ARCHER
               How come?

                             EVE
               I don't know...
                      (nuzzles him)
               Maybe because you've never needed
               my help.

                             ARCHER
               Come on, you made that up, didn't
               you?

                             EVE
               ... Maybe I did...
                      (teasing)
               ... maybe I didn't...

     They kiss affectionately.  Passion building, Eve runs her 
     hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round
     scar on his chest.  Archer freezes -- mid-caress.

                             EVE
               It's all right, Jon.

                             ARCHER
               After all these years, I still
               can't get it out of my head -- an
               inch to the left, Matty would
               still be alive.

                             EVE
               And you wouldn't be.

     No response.  The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve.

                             EVE
               Things will get better now that
               you're home.  Everything will be
               better -- now that... that man is
               finally out of our lives.

                             ARCHER
               Eve...

     He starts to say the words.  He wants, needs to share the
     truth with her.  But he can't.  Instead --

                             ARCHER
               ... If I had to do something to
               find some closure... I should do
               it, shouldn't I?... No matter how
               crazy?

                             EVE
               Oh, God -- you're going on
               assignment again...

                             ARCHER
               One last time.  And while I'm
               gone, I want you and Jamie to go
               to your mother's.  It's
               important...

                             EVE
               You said you'd be here!  You
               promised!  What could be more
               important than that?

                             ARCHER
               I can't tell you... except only I
               can do it.

                             EVE
               You want me to tell you it's okay
               to leave?  Okay, go on!  Go!

     Fury erupting, Eve pushes Archer out of the bed.


     INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Archer enters a child's room -- neat and tidy, like a 
     museum exhibit.  A starfield of glow-letters twinkles
     faintly.

     He lies down on the bed and toys with his wedding band --
     staring up at the words the stars form... "MATTHEW."

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. CONVENTION CENTER - MACHINE ROOM - BLINKING
     LIGHTS - NIGHT

     The blinking LED of the bomb timer continues to count
     down.


     INT./EXT. '56 BUICK/MOUNTAIN ROAD - MOVING - DAY

     Tito drives into the Hoag compound.

     Archer's beside him, juggling Castor's dossier:
     documents, photos, etc.

                             TITO
               Jon, this is goddam insane.  You
               can't do it.

     Archer says nothing... it's too late for debate.  Tito
     parks.  The men get out and head for the lab.

                             TITO
               You haven't got a chance in hell
               of fooling Pollux.  Castor drinks,
               smokes and walks around with a 24-
               hour hard-on.  He's nothing like
               you --

                             ARCHER
               Don't worry... If Hoag can do half
               what he claims, I'll get Pollux to
               talk.

     Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him.

                             TITO
               It's not that simple, Jon...
               Becoming another person --
               especially him -- nobody can come
               all the way back from that... not
               even you.

     Archer considers his friend's words... He toys with, then
     removes, his wedding bang.

                             ARCHER
               Keep this for me.

     As Tito takes the ring -- a caring, but concerned look
     passes between the two friends.



     INT. SURGICAL BAY - DAY

     Two huge video screens are dominated by the CG-images of
     Archer and Castor.  As Hoag briefs the team, the CG-
     images glow to reflect the physical characteristic Hoag
     refers to.

                             HOAG
               Let's walk through it, Jon.  Your
               blood types are different, but we
               can't do anything about that.
               Otherwise, nature is cooperating
               nicely.  The height difference is
               negligible -- within 1/2 an inch.
               Eye color -- almost a perfect
               match.  Penis size, flaccid,
               essentially the same --
               Substantial.

     From the observation booth above -- Miller (flanked by
     Tito and Brodie) raises his eyebrow.

     On the video screens, the images morph to signify the
     physical augmentations.

                             HOAG
               Hairline will be adjusted with
               laser-shears... micro-plugs for
               the body hair... the teeth will be
               bonded to match Castor's...

     Hoag eyes Castor's inert, tight body -- then turns to
     Archer -- prodding his love handles like a livestock
     inspector.

                             HOAG
               How about an abdominoplasty?

                             ARCHER
               Abdomino -- what?

                             HOAG
               A tummy tuck.  On the house.

                             ARCHER
               Do it.


     TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE

     (INTERCUT huge video screen enlargements of Archer and
     Castor's body parts as necessary):

     Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archer's 
     obliques.  At the same time...

     Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's
     thigh.  We PUSH IN ON his leg, then PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     Archer and Tito.  The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL
     SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself.
     Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously
     casual, like a panther.

     Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints... then layers them
     over Archer's fingers.

     Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare.  Tito hands
     him a lit cigarette.  Archer brings the cigarette to his
     lips -- then coughs harshly.  But he keeps trying.

     Castor smiles... then smirks and laughs.  PULL BACK to
     reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on
     a monitor-screen -- mimicking him.

     Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin
     spots.  Giving  up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting
     the zipper caught in his new chest hair.


     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - GROUNDS - DAY

     Tito tosses a pistol.  Archer catches it with his right
     hand.  But to Archer's surprise, Tito frowns.

                             TITO
               Nice catch.  But you used the
               wrong hand.

     He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archer's left
     hand.  Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly.

                             TITO
               Shoot me.
                      (as Archer
                       doesn't move)
               Shoot me!

     Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead.

                             TITO
               You want to be Castor Troy?  If
               you hesitate for a breath, you're
               finished!  Now -- shoot me!  Kill
               me!

     Archer holds the gun unsteadily.  Tito is disgusted.

                             TITO
               You can't do it... because Castor
               is tougher than you...

     BOOM!  The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's
     head.  Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's
     still there.

     Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination.


     EXT. HOAG'S FACILITY - NIGHT

     Clear and calm.  God's night.  Someone's God anyway.


     INT. I.C.U. ROOM - NIGHT

     Hoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror.

                             HOAG
               Let's see if I missed anything
               before I get my hands really dirty.

     Archer removes the robe.  He's amazed to see:

     His own head on Castor's body:  a flat stomach, hairy
     chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc.  Hoag touches
     Archer's scar.

                             HOAG
               You realize this has to be
               removed.
                      (as Archer
                       slowly nods)
               Then here we go, Commander.
               Through the Looking Glass...


     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

     Unconscious, Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay, 
     Castor beside him.  Hoag turns to the video technician.

                             HOAG
               Make sure you get everything --
               I'll need to study the tape before
               the reverse surgery.

     Hoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archer's face.
     Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma-
     Induction-Device (D.I.D.) attaches via suction.

     Hoag sights through the optical memory, squeezes the
     trigger.  A cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly
     slicing it.  Then Hoag lifts Archer's face -- off of his
     skull.

     Brodie and Miller watch from above.  Tito stumbles into
     the nearby bathroom to throw up.

     Hoag inspects Archer's face, then turns to his nurse.

                             HOAG
               Vault it.

     Hoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor.

     Castor's consistent EEG reading suddenly spikes
     radically -- for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize.
     Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have 
     disappeared.

     But the CAMERA CLOSES IN ON Castor's ear -- and we sense
     that, somehow, his auditory nerves might be functioning.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

     A head swathed in gauze.  The bandages start to fall 
     away.

     Tito, Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze.
     The patient looks into a mirror.

     Jon Archer has become Castor Troy.

     he touches his new face.  Archer stares... the cold
     reality chilling his blood.

     Archer buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what he's
     done to himself.  For a moment, he seems to teeter on
     madness.

                             TITO
               Jon -- are you all right?

     Archer can't respond... he's somewhere the others can't
     comprehend.  Finally he emerges... shaken, but in
     control.

     TITO enters.  Instinctively, he grabs for his holster.

                             ARCHER
               Okay... I'm okay.
                      (realizes)
               But my voice... I still sound like
               me.

                             HOAG
               I implanted a micro-chip onto your
               larynx.

     Hoag SWITCHES ON an AUDIO TAPE.  Archer repeats Castor's
     words as Hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box.

               CASTOR (V.O.)                  ARCHER
       Okay, I've got a               Okay, I've got a
       confession to make, but        confession to make, but
       you aren't gonna like          you aren't gonna like
       it... (etc.)                   it... (etc.)

     After a few repetitions, Archer's voice matches
     perfectly.

     Archer yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing 
     every muscle.  He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes
     of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes.  Archer slowly 
     turns to...

     Castor.  Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but
     something about Castor's smile -- that mocking smile...

                             ARCHER
               Now what?

                             TITO
               We're down to 72 hours.  Let's
               call Lazarro.  Castor Troy just
               came out of his coma.


     EXT. FBI HELIPORT - DAY

     Armed agents take their positions around a helipad.  A 
     jet-black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry 
     wasp.


     EXT. HELIPAD - DAY

     As Lazarro watches -- Tito escorts out a heavily-manacled 
     "Castor."  Two armed agents leap from the chopper and 
     take charge of "Castor."  He follows them pliantly,
     until --

                             TITO
               Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite
               your nuts off if he gets the
               chance!

     Archer gets the message.  He starts to resist the agents 
     and must be muscled into the chopper.  He's manacled 
     down.

     Eye contact between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this 
     very real point of departure.  The CHOPPER DOOR SLAMS
     SHUT.  It lifts off like a twister and SCREAMS away.


     EXT. HELIPORT - STAGING AREA - DAY

     The watching team breaks up, wanders back to work.

                             LOOMIS
               What a week for Archer to go on a
               training op.  Maybe we should try
               to contact him.

                             WANDA
               Forget it.  He's knee-deep in
               Georgia swamp by now.

     They pass Brodie and Miller, who watch the chopper 
     disappear over the horizon.  So far so good.     


     INT. CHOPPER - FLYING - DAY

     The agent re-checks Archer's chains.

                             ARCHER
               Don't forget -- I ordered a kosher
               meal...

     The agent smashes his elbow into Archer's gut.  The 
     second agent presses an INJECTOR against Archer's leg.
     PSSSST.  Archer spasms against the drug -- then sags
     unconscious.


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - DELOUSING CUBICLE

     Archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him.

     A guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate.

     Archer lies gasping on the steel floor, protecting his
     face.  The spray stops -- when head guard "RED" WALTON
     enters.

                             WALTON
               You are now an Erewhon inmate -- a
               citizen of nowhere.  Human rights
               zealots, the Geneva convention and
               the P.C. police have no authority
               here.  You have no right...
                      (slaps on latex gloves)
               When I say your ass belongs to me
               -- I mean it.  Bend over.

     Archer's face reflects the degradation as he bends over
     and exposes all to the cavity-searching Guard.

     Satisfied, Walton lets Archer dress.  Another guard
     places a pair of odd-looking steel boots before Archer.

                             WALTON
               Step into them.

     Archer inspects the lock-down boots.  Hinged steel
     collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle.  The
     soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts.

                             WALTON
               Don't sniff 'em, you perv.  Just
               step into them.

     Archer obeys.  A guard squats down and locks the steel
     collars over Archer's shoes.  He tries to move -- but
     can't.

                             ARCHER
               They're too tight.

                             WALTON
               So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth
               shut.

     Walton JOLTS Archer with his HIGH-VOLTAGE SHOCK-STICK.

                             WALTON
               The prison's one big magnetic
               field.  The boots'll tell us where
               you are -- every second of the
               day.
                      (into comm-link)
               201 to Population.

     Walton presses his thumb into a standard FBI scan-pad.
     It forms a print -- positively identifying the guard.
     The heavy blast-door automatically opens.

                             WALTON
               I've got fifty bucks says you're
               dead by dinner.  Don't disappoint
               me.

     Walton prods Archer toward the door.  To Archer's
     surprise -- he can now move.


     INT. GENERAL POPULATION - DAY

     The inmates eat.  Silence descends as Archer enters --
     intensifying the constant HUMMING of the MAGNETIC FIELD.
     Huge Dubov does a slow burn on seeing "Castor."

     Scanning the room for Pollux -- Archer takes a seat next
     to a LITTLE, GOATEED MAN with a French accent.

                             LITTLE MAN
               Hey, Castor -- remember me?

                             ARCHER
               Fabrice Voisine... sure, I --
                      (catches himself)
               -- I believe Jon Archer busted you
               for poisoning five members of the
               the Canadian parliament?

                             VOISINE (LITTLE MAN)
               Those scumbags should never have
               voted against the Quebecois.
                      (a beat)
               We heard you got wasted.

     Archer sees the other inmates sizing him up.

                             ARCHER
               Do I look wasted -- asshole?

     Voisine shakes his head "no" -- then his eyes widen as...

     WHAM.  Dubov leaps onto Archer and starts pummeling him.
     They slide across the table -- spilling everyone's lunch.

                             GUARD
                      (into comm-unit)
               Central.  I have a disturbance in
               population.  Go to lock down --

                             WALTON
                      (into comm-unit)
               Hold that lock down.

     Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room.
     Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling
     inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed.

     Especially his "brother" Pollux -- who watches
     uncertainly.

     Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready.  He grabs
     Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face.

                             ARCHER
               Never -- in -- the -- face.

     Holding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov
     repeatedly in the groin.  Metal boot meeting soft flesh.

     Dubov staggers back -- hurt.  Archer moves in for the
     kill, savoring it.

     Walton looks skyward.

                             WALTON
               Lock 'em down.

     INTERCUT WITH:


     UP ABOVE - CENTRAL SECURITY

     The prison's nerve center -- with video-feeds and
     monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a
     minimum.

     The two deputies react to Walton's call.  Identifying
     Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the
     appropriate switches and...

     ZAP!  The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor.  
     Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of 
     reach.

     Crack!  Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm.

                             ARCHER
               What?  He started it!

     Walton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor.

                             ARCHER
               When I get out of here --

                             WALTON
               You'll what?

                             ARCHER
               I'm going to have you fired.

     His statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs.  Everyone 
     does.  From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's 
     been accepted.

                             WALTON
                      (to Dubov)
               That's two strikes, Dubov.  One
               more and you know where you're
               going.
                      (to the others)
               Back to your 'suites' -- or no
               dinner.

     As Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux
     waiting for him.  Girding himself for this first 
     encounter -- he's got a plan.

                             POLLUX
               Hey, bro...

                             ARCHER
               -- Pollux?

                             POLLUX
               Of course it's Pollux, what the
               fuck's wrong with you?

     Archer stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods 
     him forward.  Pollux watches his "brother" go -- very 
     concerned.


     INT. ARCHER'S CELL - NIGHT

     Archer lies on his cot -- staring at the ceiling.  
     Isolated, lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go 
     insane here.


     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT

     An insanely starry night.  Van Gogh's night.  The night 
     he cut off his ear, anyway.


     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

     Castor's body lies inert.  His life-support MACHINES
     BLIPPING away.  Until the EEG spikes.  Once -- twice -- 
     three times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and 
     stabilizes.

     Castor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard.  
     Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop 
     open.

     Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out 
     the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He 
     goes down -- in agony -- groaning.

     He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab --
     until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in
     the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze.

     The discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see
     what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE...
     then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his
     cool.

     Finally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the
     phone and he dials.

                             CASTOR
               Lars... okay, Lunt, then.
                      (rifling desk
                       documents)
               Something really fucked-up
               happened... I'm in trouble... so
               listen very carefully...


     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT (LATER)

     A RANGE ROVER SCREECHES up.  At gunpoint, Lars and Lunt 
     manhandle Hoag into the lab.


     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

     Lars and Lunt hustle Hoag in.  The lab is on.  The 
     screens run -- scrolling through the video log of 
     Archer's surgery.

     Hoag sees his terrified assistants -- bound with duct
     tape.

                             HOAG
               What's this about?  What do you
               want?

     Lars shoves Hoag into a towering figure... we ZOOM IN ON
     Hoag's glasses.  And THROUGH the REFLECTION we see...


     MAN WITHOUT FACE

     Hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle, cartilage and
     bone.  The man lifts a cigarette to his lips... then 
     exhales.

                             CASTOR
               What do you think I want?


     INT. PRISON - POPULATION - DAY

     A huge wall-screen plays gentle nature scenes.  Below --
     the inmates engage in their exercise hour.

     Voisine stares at the screen -- while Pollux carefully 
     watches his "brother" play basketball.  Archer tosses up 
     an air-ball to the jeers of other inmates.

                             POLLUX
               You realize, of course, that
               magnetic humming is designed to
               drive us insane.  If we all don't
               get brain tumors first.

                              VOISINE
               And that same cloying Bambi tape
               -- over and over...

                              POLLUX
               It's like they're begging us to
               riot.  Where the fuck are we,
               anyway?
                      (the game ends)
               Gotta go...

     Pollux trots over to Archer -- passes him his cigarette.
     He studies Archer as he takes a drag -- and nearly gags.

                             POLLUX
               ... I'm worried about you.

                             ARCHER
               Why?

                             POLLUX
               Your jumpshot has no arc.  You
               used to swagger... now you swish.
               You're gumming that butt like a
               Catholic school girl.
                      (notices)
               And why do you keep picking at
               your finger?

     Pollux has caught Archer reflexively tugging at his
     phantom wedding ring.  Archer immediately stops.  He
     takes a drag and holds it -- then exhales right in
     Pollux's face.

                             ARCHER
               I was in a coma...

     Pollux sticks his finger under Archer's eye and pulls 
     down like a vet examining a sick dog.  Archer pushes him 
     off.

                             ARCHER
               My reflexes, my senses, my
               memory... everything's jumbled.  I
               can't even tell you why Dubov
               jumped me yesterday.

                             POLLUX
               You Pollinated his wife the day he
               was arrested.  How could forget
               that?

                             ARCHER
               I've forgotten plenty.  Look
               around -- we've screwed over half
               the freaks in here.  What's gonna
               happen to us if they think I've
               lost it?

     Pollux contemplates the other inmates -- circling, sizing
     up the brothers like hungry sharks.  Instinctively,
     Pollux moves closer to Archer for protection.

                             ARCHER
               I need you to play big brother for
               once -- till I can fill in a few
               blanks.  Think you can handle
               that?

     Pollux nods grimly -- then Archer pulls up his sleeve,
     exposing the pyramid tattoo.

                             ARCHER
               I know I got this on my tenth
               birthday.  I just can't remember
               why.

                             POLLUX
               Man -- that was the worst day of
               our lives!

     Archer feigns a "struggle" with his memory.  He lights a
     new butt with the old -- chain-style... then "remembers."

                             ARCHER
               Oh, God -- Mom O-D'd at County
               General.

                             POLLUX
               Retching and convulsing while
               those bastards didn't even try to
               save her sorry ass.  You gave her
               mouth to mouth -- man -- even then
               you had some constitution.
                      (a beat)
               Remember what you swore to me at
               the funeral?

                             ARCHER
               Uh -- to kill the doctors?

                             POLLUX
               After that.  You promised you'd
               always take care of me.

                             ARCHER
               And I bet I kept that promise...

                             POLLUX
               Only one you've never broken.

     Pollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort.  Archer
     puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the
     trap.

                             ARCHER
               Screw the past.  We've got the
               future to look forward to.
                      (a beat)
               We still have tomorrow.

                             POLLUX
               No shit... five million bucks...
               now those Red Militia crackpots
               get to keep it.

                             ARCHER
               That's not the worst part.

                             POLLUX
               What's worse than losing five
               million bucks?

                             ARCHER
               Being stuck in this rat-hole when
               it blows.  What you built was a
               work of art.  It belongs in the
               Smithsonian.

     Pollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word.

                             POLLUX
               Yeah -- well... the L.A.
               Convention Center will have to
               do...

                             ARCHER
               Thanks, Pollux.

                             POLLUX
               'Thanks'?  I guess they really did
               fuck you up.

     Then Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer.  Without knowing
     exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux.


     INT. ARCHER'S CELL - DAY

     Archer paces impatiently... as the door rolls open.
     Walton is looking at him with cool respect.

                             WALTON
               You have a visitor.

     Archer smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodie's
     timeliness.


     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Archer's boots lock down -- as the guillotine door rises.
     But his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror.  
     Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of --

     Jon Archer.  This man has Archer's face -- his real face.

                             IMPOSTOR
               What's the matter?  Don't you like
               the new me?

     Archer studies the image of his former self -- trying to
     understand.  Then he recognizes the smirk on the face, 
     the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he 
     cannot say...

                             ARCHER
               -- Castor...?

                             CASTOR
               Not anymore.

                             ARCHER
               It can't be.  It's impossible.

                             CASTOR
               I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used
               was 'titanically remote'.  Who
               knows?  Maybe the trauma of having
               my face cut off pulled me out.  Or
               maybe God really is on my side
               after all.
                      (starts pacing)
               By the way, I know you don't get
               the papers in here.

     Continuing to circle, he displays the current LA Times:

         "INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead"

                             CASTOR
               Terrible tragedy.
               Hoag was such a genius -- but
               selfish with his artistry.  I
               actually had to torture his
               assistants to convince him to
               perform the same surgery on me.

                             ARCHER
               You killed them?

                             CASTOR
               Of course I killed them, you dumb
               fuck.  Hoag, his staff...

     FLASH ON Hoag's body -- on the floor of the burning lab.
     Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoag's.

                             CASTOR
               Miller and Brodie --

     FLASH ON Brodie and Miller -- dead in a mangled car
     wreck.

                             CASTOR
               I even paid a visit to your buddy
               Tito.

                             ARCHER
               He doesn't know anything about
               this!

                             CASTOR
               Come on, Jon.  I think I know you
               better than that.  I only wish you
               could have been there to see the
               look on his face --

     FLASH ON Tito... he smiles, then recoils in shock as
     Castor lifts a pistol and shoots him... then he picks up
     Archer's wedding band off the counter...


     INT. EREWHON PRISON (PRESENT)

     Archer stares -- thunderstruck -- at the wedding band now
     on Castor's finger.

                             CASTOR
               -- then again, I guess you were
               there.
                      (a beat)
               I torched every shred of evidence
               that proves who you are.  So
               swallow this -- you are going to
               be in here for the rest of your
               life.

                             ARCHER
               Castor, don't do this --

                             CASTOR
               No discussion, Jon -- no deals.
               Now if you'll excuse me, I've got
               an important government job to
               abuse, and a beautiful wife to
               fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean 'make
               love to.'

     Archer freaks out.  He screams, flails -- unable to reach
     Castor.  Castor opens the door and guards rush in --
     clubbing Archer and shocking him senseless.

                             WALTON
               Sorry, sir.

                             CASTOR
               It's quite all right.  You never
               know what to expect from a
               psychopathic criminal...


     INT. CELL BLOCK - DAY

     The guards dump Archer into his cell.

                             WALTON
               Better be nice, Castor.  You could
               get mighty lonely now that Pollux
               is gone.

                             ARCHER
               Pollux is -- what?

                             WALTON
               Archer cut him a deal for turning
               state's evidence.  He's been
               released...

                             ARCHER
               Walton, you have to listen to me
               -- right now!

                             WALTON
               Or what?  You'll have me fired?
                      (pushes a button)
               You're confined until I say
               otherwise...

     The steel panels shut - silencing Archer's pleading
     voice.


     INT. ARCHER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

     Sipping a beer, Castor cruises past the suburban bliss:
     men on hammocks; women chatting; kids playing tag.

                             CASTOR
                      (sickened)
               Jesus, what a life.

     Castor tries to catch a street address and rolls past...


     ARCHER'S HOUSE

     Dressed for work, Eve watches blandly as the car goes by.
     A moment later, it backs up and parks.

     Hiding the beer can, Castor forces a sheepish smile --
     and gets out.  She doesn't smile back.

                             EVE
               I suppose it was only a matter of
               time before you forgot where we
               lived.

                             CASTOR
               Sorry -- the job's been murder
               lately.

     Castor looks her over -- she's much sexier than he 
     expected.

                             EVE
               So what happened to your
               'important' assignment?

                             CASTOR
               What do you know about it?

                             EVE
               I know exactly what you always
               tell me:  Absolutely nothing.

                             CASTOR
               It didn't work out the way
               everyone thought it would.  Where
               are you off to?

                             EVE
               I've got surgery.

                             CASTOR
               Surgery -- are you okay?

     Then he spots her medical bag.  Oops.

                             EVE
               Don't try to charm me -- I'm still
               angry.  There're leftovers in the
               fridge.

                             CASTOR
               Have fun at work.

     Castor kisses her good-bye -- on the mouth.

                             EVE
               What is with you?

                             CASTOR
               Don't I usually kiss my wife?

                             EVE
               No.

     Castor reacts as she gets in the car and pulls out.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Castor steps inside, looks around.

                             CASTOR
               What a dump.


     INT. STUDY - DAY

     Castor sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past,
     studying the ones with photos.  He's memorizing -- 
     matching names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's, 
     etc.

     Something else catches his eye.  He finds a floral
     notebook -- Eve's diary -- and pages through it.  Then,
     he reads:

                             CASTOR
               '... "Date-night" has been a
               typical failure... we haven't made
               love in almost two months...'
               What a loser ...

     Castor hears a voice.  Glancing across the hall, he
     sees...


     GLIMPSES OF JAMIE

     As she walks back and forth in her room, talking on the
     phone -- and wearing only panties and a cropped T-shirt.
     Castor steps closer -- enjoying the view.

                             CASTOR
               The plot thickens.


     INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - DAY

     Jamie stamps out her cigarette.

                             JAMIE
               -- I got your E-mail, Karl.  That
               poem was really sweet --
                      (spots Castor
                       at door)
               Hang on a sec...

     She slams it -- but he gets his foot inside.

                             JAMIE
               I'll call you back.
                      (to Castor)
               You're not respecting my
               boundaries.

                             CASTOR
               I'm coming in, Janie.

     Castor pushes menacingly into the room.

                             JAMIE
               'Janie'?

     Castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow.  
     He gazes seductively -- unnerving Jamie as he steps 
     toward her.

                             CASTOR
               I don't think you heard me...
               Jamie... You have something I
               want ...

     He reaches for her -- and right past her.  He picks up a
     pack of cigarettes from the desk.

                             JAMIE
               Clarissa left those here.

                             CASTOR
                      (shrugs and
                       lights up)
               I won't tell mom if you don't.

                             JAMIE
               When did you start smoking?

                             CASTOR
               You'll be seeing a lot of changes
               around here --
                      (blows a perfect
                       smoke ring)
               Daddy's a new man.

     Jamie stares, astonished, as Castor goes out.


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - ARCHER'S CELL

     Fists bloody, voice hoarse, Archer pounds at the cell
     door.  Exhausted, he finally stops -- staring at the face
     of his enemy in the mirrored door -- the enemy who now
     has total command of his life.


     INT. FBI - LOBBY CHECKPOINT - DAY

     Castor dons his stern "Archer" face as the gate guard
     checks his thumbprint ID.  He's cleared and waved in.


     INT. FBI INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

     Buzz and Wanda watch Pollux through the two-way mirror.
     He's gorging himself on a big lunch.  Castor arrives.

                             BUZZ
               Listen, sir... we just want you to
               know...

                             WANDA
               We're all really sorry about
               Tito...

                             CASTOR
               Yeah, well, shit happens.

     Buzz and Wanda exchange a glance.  To them, "Archer" is
     just avoiding his feelings again.

                             CASTOR
               How's our star witness?

                             BUZZ
               He hasn't told us a damn thing
               except what kind of mustard he
               likes on his tongue sandwiches.

                             WANDA
               If that bomb is out there -- we're
               almost out of time.

                             LAZARRO (O.S.)
               Archer!

     Lazarro stomps toward them... furious.  Buzz and Wanda
     quickly excuse themselves.

                             LAZARRO
               You made a deal with Pollux Troy?
               He's 'a manipulative psychopath.'
               Your own words, Jon!

                             CASTOR
               Just let me do my job, Victor.

                             LAZARRO
               The job I've been protecting for
               the last eight years.  From now
               on, you go strictly by the book.
               Everything gets cleared by me.
               Understand?

     Lazarro stomps off.  Castor watches him go, wheels
     turning.


     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Castor enters -- shutting down the mikes... and the
     blinds.

                             CASTOR
               You're supposed to be snitching --
               making me look good.

                             POLLUX
               'Look good'?
                      (drops food in
                       disgust)
               Seeing that face -- I want to
               vomit.

                             CASTOR
               I'm the one who has to look at
               this butt-ugly mug every time I
               pass a mirror.  Look at my eyes,
               my chin, my perfect nose -- gone!
                      (considers his
                       reflection)
               Archer took my life, so I'm taking
               his.  Bro, I'm going straight.

                             POLLUX
               Sounds like they took your brain,
               too?

                             CASTOR
               Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar
               Hoover.  Carlos the Jackal running
               Interpol.  Kaddafi heading the
               Mossad.  Think of the secrets we
               could sell...

     Pollux listens carefully -- mind clicking like an abacus.

                             POLLUX
               The drug agents we could expose.
               The movie stars we could
               blackmail!

                             CASTOR
               That's just the bottom of the food
               chain.  Pollux -- what would
               happen if somebody planted a bomb
               on Air Force One?

                             POLLUX
               ... that somebody would get rich.
               And, I suppose, the nation would
               be pretty pissed-off.

                             CASTOR
               Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking
               for someone to step in, take
               charge, give them hope again.
               What if that someone was an F.B.I.
               hero?  A true Boy Scout and family
               man -- with a spotless past.
               Imagine where that guy could land
               -- if the timing's right.

                             POLLUX
               It's an audacious dream, Caz.  But
               Jon Archer is hardly a household
               name.

                             CASTOR
               Not yet he isn't.  But after you
               'confess' -- you'll be a free man.
               And I'll be on my way...


     EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

     Police VEHICLES ROAR into position.  Squads of police
     evacuate throngs of people.


     INT. CONVENTION CENTER - SUB-BASEMENT - EXTREME
     CLOSEUP - BOMB TIMER - DAY

     TICKS down to less than two minutes.

     Working as a unit, the BOMB SQUAD carefully remove the
     bomb's casing.  Inside, the complex guts glow evilly.
     The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their 
     league.

                             BOMB LEADER
               Jesus... Any suggestions?

                             TECHNICIAN
               Yeah... run

     Castor pushes up his blast visor.  He looks grim.

                             BOMB LEADER
               It's protected by a vibration
               detector... One touch and...

                             CASTOR
               Evacuate your team, Captain.

                             BOMB LEADER
               Sir, you can't disarm it --

                             CASTOR
               Just go!

     The bomb squad hustles out.  Waiting until he's alone,
     Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its
     switch.  The bomb's glow dies instantly.


     EXTREME CLOSEUP - TIMER

     stops at 26 seconds.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Not satisfied, Castor starts it up again -- running the
     timer down to four seconds.  That's better.

     
     INT. EREWHON PRISON - "POPULATION" - DAY

     The inmates eat lunch.  Walton enters -- prodding a
     beaten Jon Archer ahead of him.

                             WALTON
               A special privilege today:  TV --
               by order of Agent Jon Archer of
               the F.B.I...

     Jeers from the inmates as the big screen changes from the
     nature loop to... CNN.


     ON SCREEN - CONVENTION CENTER

     "Sweating," Castor lumbers out, carrying the disarmed
     bomb.

                            ANCHORMAN (V.O.)
               That was the scene at the L.A.
               Convention Center, where an F.B.I.
               agent is being hailed as a hero.
               Agent Jon Archer disarmed a
               powerful bomb just seconds before
               it was set to explode.  Let's get
               the latest from Valerie Rice...


     EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

     Castor basks in the attention of the gathered media.

                             REPORTER RICE
               The apparent target was a group of
               Supreme Court justices -- due to
               speak here today.
                      (thrusting microphone)
               Mr. Archer, do you have any idea
               who planted it?

                             CASTOR
               That's classified.  But if he's
               listening I have a message for
               him:
                      (directly into
                       camera)
               Nice try.  Now you know who's
               really in charge.


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION

     Watching the TV, Archer's enraged, frustrated.  Then his 
     eyes focus... he watches closely as --

     A guard uses his "thumbprint ID" to get through the 
     security door.  Archer's eyes fall on the thumbprint scan
     pad.


     INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY

     Castor gets a "thumbs up" from some co-workers, others
     smile -- but they know better than to applaud.

                             CASTOR
               Don't you guys watch TV?  Where's
               the parade?

     They look at each other -- afraid.  But proud rookie 
     Loomis starts clapping, so everyone else joins in rousing 
     applause.

                             CASTOR
               -- Loomis, Buzz, uh -- Wanda...
               all of you, thanks from the bottom
               of my heart.  Thanks for enduring
               all those years I was an
               insufferable boor.  From now on --
               consider me reborn.

                             WANDA
               Stop the presses -- Jon Archer
               found a personality...

     Wild applause... interrupted by an excited Kim.

                             KIM
               Sir... the White House is calling.

     Castor acts startled... as if at a loss.  Then he struts
     toward his office -- pausing only to give Kim a playful
     swat on the rump.  She's stunned.


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Castor surveys his new domain.  He settles into Archer's
     big leather chair... sees a framed photo of Archer and
     family.  He apes Archer's dumb posed smile...

                             CASTOR
               Jon, your career is finally taking
               of.
                      (picks up phone)
               Archer.  Sure I'll hold...

     Waiting, he picks up a handbook:  You and the FBI:  A
     Primer for New Employees.  Then...

                             CASTOR
               Mr. President, what an honor...

     Castor pumps a "whacking off" gesture with his hand.


     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY

     Castor, carrying grocery bags, comes into the back yard 
     where Jamie practices free throws.  He watches her miss.

                             CASTOR
               How about a game of horse?

                             JAMIE
               Don't make me beat your butt
               again, Dad.  It's harmful to my
               developing psyche.

                             CASTOR
               Afraid you'll lose?

     Castor crisply sinks a free-throw.  Jamie glares, takes
     the ball -- and tosses an air-ball.

                             CASTOR
               'H.'

     Jamie sneers at him.  He buries another one.

                             CASTOR
               Try putting a higher arc on the
               ball... and square your shoulders
               to the basket.

     Begrudgingly, she listens -- and sinks a clean shot.
     Pleased, she nods.  HONK!  A BMW pulls into the driveway.

                             JAMIE
               Gotta go.  Karl's here.

     Jamie trots over to greet KARL (17) -- a clean-cut
     preppie.  Opening the car door dor her, Karl waves,
     smiling at Castor.  Castor studies Karl carefully, not
     liking what he sees.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT

     A tired Eve opens the door.  It's pitch black inside.  As
     she fumbles for the light switch...


     MATCH

     flares as Castor lights a candle.  The dining room table
     is set for a candlelight dinner.  He smiles warmly at her
     confusion.

                             CASTOR
               Don't tell me you forgot.  Eve --
               it's date night!


     DINING ROOM - LATER

     Eve looks up from her pasta.  After an awkward silence.

                             EVE
               Why do I feel like I'm on a blind
               date?

                             CASTOR
               It's important to keep some
               mystery... so things stay...
               unpredictable.

     Eve studies him as he pours her more wine.  Her smile
     slowly fades as she realizes what's going on.

                             EVE
               'Unpredictable'?  You're about as
               unpredictable as the tide.
                      (detached)
               How long are you going to be gone
               this time?

                             CASTOR
               Gone?

                             EVE
               Isn't that what all this is about?
               The wine, cooking me dinner --
               your next assignment?

                             CASTOR
               I'm not going anywhere.

                             EVE
               You always say that -- then you
               leave.

                             CASTOR
               I bet I deserved that.  I bet Jon
               Archer is the most inattentive,
               sexless spouse on Earth.

                             EVE
               Jon, that's not true --

                             CASTOR
               Of course it's true, but I'm
               trying to change?  I'm here
               because I want to be alone with
               you.  I want to see the candle-
               light dance in your beautiful --

     Uh-oh.  Castor can't tell the color of Eve's eyes.  He 
     leans in "romantically" -- but we know the real reason.

                             CASTOR
               -- brown eyes.

     He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin.  She's
     aroused, but wary.  So Castor goes in for the kill.

                             CASTOR
               I wanted it all to be just
               right... when I told you about my
               promotion.

                             EVE
               Your what?

                             CASTOR
               Well, I don't have it yet.  But
               Lazarro's getting old -- he won't
               be around forever.  And I'm
               getting the itch to move up.

                             EVE
               Jon... that's wonderful.

                             CASTOR
               So you see, I'm not going
               anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs
               with you...


     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Castor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the 
     water.

     He rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to 
     carrion.  As they drop to the floor of the stall -- water 
     filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and
     whispers...

                             CASTOR
               baby, it's like I'm having you for
               the first time.

     Dirty water runs down a floor drain... PULL BACK to:


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT

     Desolate, Archer mops down the rec area.

                             ARCHER
               Don't they ever let us take off
               these boots?

                             VOISINE
               Not unless you're sent to the
               'Clinic.'

                             ARCHER
               You mean if I get sick?

                             VOISINE
               They don't give two fucks about
               your health.  The Clinic's where
               they send the real hard-cases for
               attitude adjustment.  Dubov just
               got sent down -- and look at
               Wainwright --

     Voisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby -- WAINWRIGHT
     -- who sits in a corner -- gnawing at his knuckles.

                             VOISINE
               Toughest bastard I ever saw --
               after you, of course.  Now he's a
               fucking drool case.

                             ARCHER
               What did he do?

                             VOISINE
               He hit a guard.

     Archer sees Walton hovering nearby.  Archer heads for
     him.

                             WALTON
               Looking for trouble, Castor?

                             ARCHER
               As a matter of fact -- yes.

     Crack!  Archer decks Walton.


     INT. PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT

     Walton and a guard herd Archer toward a steel door.


     INT. "CLINIC" - NIGHT

     Archer is dumped on the floor.  He sees he's lying in a
     puddle of something.  He looks up -- and recoils.

     ARCHER'S POV - DUBOV

     is strapped to a vertical gurney -- post-procedure.  His 
     limbs are stiff, his eyes blank as a mako shark's.  But 
     his feet are bare -- bootless.

                             MED-TECH
               Where's the mop, he puked all over
               the place.

     An assistant unstraps Dubov and drops him on a gurney.

                             MED-TECH
                      (mopping up)
               -- next time, bring them in before
               dinner...

     Archer cases the place:  Above is a catwalk... leading
     out.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Walton muscles Archer into the gurney.  The Med-Tech 
     smirks.

                             MED-TECH
               Oh happy day -- Castor Troy.

     The Med-Tech wheels the ECT head-gear cart into place: 
     twin needle-like BOLTS ready to fit into ARCHER'S ears.  
     A single blue static spark jumps from the bolts.

     Walton roughly wedges Archer's head into the head gear,
     shoving the chewed-up bite strap into Archer's mouth.

                             WALTON
               Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll
               be gumming baby food from here on
               out.

                             MED-TECH
               Get his boots, Sergeant.

     Walton unlocks Archer's first boot and pulls it off.  As
     the Med-Tech starts to fasten Archer's arm -- Walton 
     unlocks and pulls off the second boot.

     Archer's feet are free.  Crack!  He yanks his foot up 
     hard -- Walton reels back, stunned.

     One arm still restrained, Archer backrolls in the gurney 
     and kicks the head-gear cart away -- knocking it into the 
     Med-Tech who collapses onto it, hitting "Test" --

     ZAP!  The HEAD-BOLTS FIRE, catching the Med-Tech through 
     the shoulder -- he drops to the floor, his synapses shot.

     Seeing that Archer is still restrained by the arm -- the
     assistant darts out of the room.

     As Archer pulls free -- Walton looms over him -- gun
     poised.

     Then -- wham!  Dubov wallops Walton -- using his boots as
     brass knuckles.  The head guard collapses.

     Dubov smiles dumbly at Archer -- all trace of vendetta
     now obliterated.  Archer nods gratefully -- they're on
     the same team... at least for now.

     Suddenly the ALARM BLARES.

     Archer sees guards charging the room.  He tries closing
     the door -- but the guards arrive.  Dubov lumbers over
     and puts his massive weight into it -- and slams the door
     shut.

     O.S., guards POUND at the now-locked door.

     Archer quickly frisks Walton -- coming up with a
     cigarette lighter.  he pockets it.

     Scanning around -- Archer leaps onto a mounted, hinged
     lamp.  it swings against the wall.  Archer uses it to
     reach the catwalk above.

                             ARCHER
               Dubov -- come on!

     Dubov obeys and follows Archer up onto the catwalk.

     A groggy Walton muscles open the door from inside.  
     Guards pour in.  Walton grabs an AUTO-RIFLE and opens 
     FIRE.

     SLUGS chase Archer and Dubov as they flee through the
     catwalk door.


     INT. CENTRAL SECURITY CONTROL

     Two guards watch Archer and Dubov disappear off the
     clinic's monitor.  They grab their shock-sticks and rush
     for the door.

     The door opens -- revealing Dubov and Archer.  Perfectly
     in synch -- they double cold-cock the startled guards.
     Archer grabs a shock-stick -- and fuses the door shut.

     He yanks out wires and shatters the computers.  Dubov
     mimics the behavior -- ripping out an entire console --
     and revealing a narrow cable duct.

     Flames explode -- shorting the circuitry -- the DRONING
     HUM RISES -- the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous
     surge.


     AROUND PRISON

     Chaos.  Guards scatter as the huge diamond-vision SCREEN
     EXPLODES and inmates are flung like rag-dolls by their
     short-circuiting boots.  Anything metallic flies into the
     magnetic domes.


     SECURITY CENTRAL

     As the men back through the cable duct -- Archer
     struggles to replace the heavy console.

     The DOOR is BLOWN open.  Walton enters to find... no one.
     Then his eyes light on the console -- slightly askew.


     INT. CABLE CORRIDOR

     Archer and Dubov rush down the tight corridor -- and
     around the bend.  The corridor ends in a...


     STORAGE/MAINTENANCE AREA

     Lined with tools, toilets, sinks, a rack of old lock-down
     boots.  They race through the far door...


     INT. CENTRAL TOWER ROOM

     Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level
     labyrinth.  A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with
     catwalks, staircases and high walls.

     ECHOES resound -- SHOUTING, FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER --
     they seem to be coming from all around them.

     Over the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and
     other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall.  He pulls one
     screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized
     wall.

     Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came.  

                                                SMASH CUT:


     SHEER WALL

     Archer and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal
     boots.  They climb higher and higher as...

     Guards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and
     around them -- oblivious.

     Archer and Dubov almost reach the next level when...

                             WALTON
               There!

     BULLETS SMACK the wall around them -- just as Archer and
     Dubov reach the next catwalk.

     Archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far
     end.  But four guards descend on them -- and block their
     way.

     Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking
     guards.  Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more
     guards.  Dubov drops another over the catwalk.

     They continue their desperate race for the door --
     reaching the landing.  As BULLETS PING around them --
     hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel.  He uses it as a
     shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter.

     As SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the
     flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold.

     He presses his thumb to the door's keypad.  To his 
     horror, its LED reads "print unreadable."

     Walton and guards movie in, FIRING at closer and closer
     range.

     Dubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.  The
     shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly
     disintegrating.

     Archer licks his thumb, tries again.  Finally it reads
     "Clearance Confirmed"... the door slides open.

                             ARCHER
               Let's go!

     Dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but
     as he turns to follow... Walton BLOWS him away.

     Archer reaches to pull Dubov through, but the riddled
     inmate ignores the helping hand.  Pulling the door shut,
     he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily.


     INT. HIGH CATWALK TOWER

     Archer hesitates for a moment... but that's all he has.
     he keeps going... up the winding staircase-catwalk --
     higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing
     guards.

     As BULLETS CLANG around him -- Archer reaches the top.
     He ignores a sign which reads...

                        EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY
                       SAFETY LINES REQUIRED

     He charges straight up a ladder and plows right
     through --

                                                SMASH CUT:

     EXT. PRISON - DAWN

     Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world.

     A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the
     bird...

     PULL WAY, WAY BACK to reveal:

     The prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what
     appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform.  

     Archer rushes over to a transport chopper.


     INSIDE COCKPIT

     Archer searches for the keys.  No go.  He throws
     switches.  Nothing works.

     Guards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING.  Archer leaps
     from the chopper and jumps over the side to the
     platform's --


     LOWER LEVEL

     He lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and
     rolls to the ground.  He grabs a high-pressure hose --
     and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards
     close in.

     Archer BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON --
     knocking Walton and others into the sea.  Archer upends a
     stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards.
     Archer spots:


     TUGBOAT

     pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea.

     Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail --
     where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back.  Under
     FIRE -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the
     platform.

     Hanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean.
     At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into...


     CHOPPY SEA

     He pulls himself into the ZODIAC and frees it from the
     tug.  It ROARS off.


     EXT. ZODIAC - MOVING - DAY

     The nylon craft zips through the waves -- approaching San
     Pedro Harbor.  The ENGINE SPUTTERS... low on gas.

                             ARCHER
               Come on... come on...

     Archer senses something... He looks up and...

     Whoosh!  Something swoops down -- but it's just a
     pelican.

     He FIDDLES with the ENGINE -- which finally DIES.  Archer
     grabs the oars -- about to start rowing when --

     Another swoop!  This time it's the prison chopper.

     Archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor.  An
     idea.


     WIDE SHOT

     The chopper settles over the Zodiac.

     Wind and water swirl around Archer...


     CHOPPER

     Walton, drenched but obviously rescued, has archer in his
     sights... He starts to FIRE his MACHINE GUNS...


     ZODIAC

     BULLETS RAIN down on the boat -- destroying it -- as
     Archer dives into the rolling swells...


     INSIDE CHOPPER

     Walton RAKES the debris -- shredding it.

     The chopper does a final circle of the wreckage... then
     moves off... its ROTOR WASH THRASHING the buoy.


     UNDER BUOY

     Archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy -- sucking
     air.


     INT. ARCHER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

     Eve's asleep.  Castor, dressed, looks down at her like 
     Cortez at Montezuma -- triumphant, with overwhelming 
     power.


     EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

     Heading for the car, Castor is about to light up when --

                             EVE
               Last night, I thought -- this
               isn't my husband.

     He pockets the smoke.  Eve is there, dressed somberly.

                             EVE
               Then I woke up in the middle of
               the night -- and found you passed
               out in the study.

                             CASTOR
               I couldn't sleep -- you roll
               around a lot.
                      (jingles car keys)
               Anyway, I'm late.

                             EVE
               Jon, you know what day it is.  I
               know it's difficult for you, but
               we still have to go.

                             CASTOR
               Can't we skip it just this once?
               I gotta 'protect and serve', you
               know.

                             EVE
               'Protect and serve' later.  You're
               going.

                             CASTOR
               Okay, if you insist.  But -- you
               drive.

     He climbs into the front seat beside her.


     INT./EXT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

     A pastoral, hilly area near the coast.

                             CASTOR
               So who's this Karl creep Jamie's
               been seeing?  He's a little old
               for her, isn't he?

                             EVE
               I don't know... they're about the
               same ages we were when we met.
                      (smiles)
               Remember the all-night dentist?

                             CASTOR
               Sure, how could I forget.
                      (changes subject)
               By the way, you never said
               anything about last night...

     He moves closer, stroking her hair as his BEEPER sounds.

                             EVE
               Aren't you going to get that?

     He turns his beeper off, then touches her lips with his
     finger.  Without knowing exactly why, Eve tenses up.

                             EVE
               Jon -- this is hardly the time or
               place.

     Castor looks around in surprise because he sees she's 
     driving into --


     SPRAWLING MEMORIAL PARK

     They drive through the gates -- passing a church marked
     "ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA."  Nearby, the OCEAN ROARS.


     EXT. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY - DAY

     It's beautiful here, striking and sad.  Now on foot,
     Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of 
     graves -- with no idea where she's leading him.

     Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.  Castor
     joins her and reads the etched marble stone:

                       Matthew Archer, Age 5
                       Beloved Son & Brother
                       We Cherish You Always

     Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker.

                             EVE
               Happy birthday, Matty.

     She places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark...
     a little bulldozer... a spaceship.  Overwhelmed with 
     grief, she collapses into Castor.

                             EVE
               He took our baby, Jon.  He took
               our little boy.


     FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S FACE

     He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy 
     whose mother is weeping into his chest.

     The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly 
     returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the 
     victim's pain.

                             CASTOR
               Stop crying... stop crying...
               stop ...


     INT. FBI BULLPEN - DAY

     Shaking off his funk, Castor arrives at the office.

                             WANDA
               You picked a helluva day to leave
               your beeper off!

                             CASTOR
               What happened?

                             WANDA
               Castor's dead!

                             CASTOR
               He's -- what?

                             BUZZ
               Somehow he escaped from Erewhon.
               But a prison chopper mowed him
               down just off Long Beach Harbor...

                             CASTOR
               Where's the body?

                             WANDA
               It hasn't been recovered yet.

                             CASTOR
               'It hasn't been recovered yet!'
               You people have no idea who you're
               dealing with!
                      (beat)
               I want everyone on this, reports
               on the half hour, and all leads
               get routed through my office.
               Buzz, alert the L.A.P.D.

                             BUZZ
               L.A.P.D.?  Even if he is alive,
               Castor isn't stupid enough to come
               back to the city.

                             CASTOR
               He's alive -- and he's already
               here.  Move!


     EXT. PIER - NIGHT

     Something bobs up in the surf.  Archer is thrashed ashore
     by the breakers... he crawls gasping onto the sand.  He
     takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach.


     EXT. TITO'S STREET - NIGHT

     Archer's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon
     taped across Tito's front door.  Some teenage cholos
     notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going.


     INT. TITO'S DUPLEX - NIGHT

     A rear window is forced open -- Archer pulls himself in.
     In the dim light, he sees the bullet hole on the wall...
     then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks.

     He buckles and has to sit down.  Taking a deep breath, he
     picks up the phone and dials.

                             ARCHER
               Dr. Archer please.   It's an
               emergency.
                      (listens)
               -- Her husband.

     Archer waits.  He pinches his throat -- trying to 
     dislodge the vocal implant.  His voice scrambles into 
     garbled static.

                             ARCHER
               Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds
               crazy, but --
                      (reverting back)
               Dammit.


     INT. HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT

     EVE deftly stitches up a gash above little IRIS's (8)
     eye.

                             EVE
               How did this happen, sweetie?

                             IRIS'S DAD
               She fell off her Big-Wheel.

     Something about his too-quick response rankles Eve.  She
     eyes the yuppy Dad with suspicion -- then notes some
     bruises on the child's arm.  A NURSE enters.

                             NURSE
               Dr. Archer -- your husband's on
               three.

                             EVE
               Get Child Services down here --
               and don't let her father leave.
                      (goes to wall-phone)
               Jon?  Hello?

     INTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary.

                             ARCHER
               Eve, listen carefully.  The man
               you think is your husband --
               isn't.

                             EVE
               Who is this?

                             ARCHER
               Please, just listen!  Take Jamie
               and go to your mother's in Santa
               Fe.  Don't tell him where you're
               going -- just go.

                             EVE
               Whoever you are -- don't call
               again...

     CLICK.  Archer sags in futility.  A SIREN snaps him back
     to reality.

     Archer goes to the window and carefully peers out.

     A squad CAR ROARS INTO VIEW -- then continues on its way.

                             ARCHER
               I need to speak to Director
               Lazarro immediately... I have
               information about Castor Troy.

     Waiting... Archer rifles the room... finding car keys...
     a baggy jacket... Then...

     INTERCUT WITH:


     INT. FBI OFFICE

                             CASTOR
               This is Jon Archer.  Who's
               calling?

     Archer pauses... hearing his own voice speaking to him.

                             ARCHER
               Well, if you're Jon Archer... I
               guess this must be Castor Troy...

                             CASTOR
               I've gotta hand it to you, Jon.
               You're doing a damn respectable
               job of being me.  But let's face
               it, we both liked it better the
               way it was.  So before the cops
               blow your brains out -- why not
               tell me where you are...

                             ARCHER
               If you were really me, you'd
               know -- no discussion, no deals.

     Archer hangs up == leaving Castor stewing.


     EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

     The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick.
     The big V-8 RUMBLES as Archer pulls out.  He doesn't get
     far as... menacing CHOLOS block his way.

                             CHOLO # 1
               Where are you going?

                             CHOLO #2
               Ten bucks he's the guy who popped
               Tito!

     The Cholos surround the Buick.  Archer's cornered like an
     animal as the angry teens pound on the windows.

     Archer HITS the GAS -- scattering all except Cholo #1 who
     jumps on the hood.  Archer SLAMS the BRAKES -- sending
     the guy flying.  He lands hard, but is only shaken up.

     As Archer roars off, Cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone.

                             CHOLO #1
               9-1-1?  I want to report a stolen
               car and don't put me on hold!


     INT./EXT. BUICK - MOVING - NIGHT

     Archer drives on -- listening to KFWB.

                             RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)
               ... the escapee is considered
               extremely dangerous.  If you have
               any information concerning the
               whereabouts of Castor Troy...

     He SHUTS it OFF as he sees in the distance:


     HIS OWN HOME

     FBI and LAPD vehicles are parked in front.  No way he's
     getting near there.

     In his rearview mirror Archer spots a cop car
     approaching.  He quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly
     cruises by.

                             ARCHER
               No, Jon... you have to think like
               Castor.  Where would he go...?

     Archer gets an idea.  But as he drives on -- the cop car
     backs up -- and reappears INTO FRAME.

     
     EXT. MELROSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Dietrich locks up his chic art gallery.  He gets in his 
     Lexus and drives out of the parking lot.


     INT./EXT. STREET - LEXUS - MOVING - NIGHT

     Dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team
     swarming all over Tito's parked Buick.  Dietrich quickly
     averts his face as he spots... "Jon Archer" inspecting
     Tito's Buick.

                             DIETRICH
               Jon Archer... some poor schmuck's
               in big trouble.

                             ARCHER
               Yeah -- me.

     With surprising speed, Dietrich yanks a pistol from
     someplace and jerks around --

     Archer -- hunkered down in the back seat -- stares into 
     the barrel of Dietrich's pistol.

                             DIETRICH
               Jesus Christ, Castor.

                             ARCHER
               Drive.  And punch up your
               cellular -- I need you to make
               some calls.

                             DIETRICH
               You're gonna get me busted!

                             ARCHER
               You're already busted, Dietrich.
               It's just a matter of time before
               they pick you up.

     Dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds
     off.

                             DIETRICH
               Man, when you came to me about
               that bomb -- I knew I should have
               blown you off... but that's my
               fucking curse -- I just can't say
               no to a friend.

                             ARCHER
               You can't say no to money.

                             DIETRICH
               That's my other curse.


     EXT. DOWNTOWN - LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

     Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low-
     rent streets.

     Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo,
     Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee.


     INT. DIETRICH'S LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Archer splashes water on his face -- then stops and
     listens as the DOORBELL RINGS.  He screws up his courage.

                             ARCHER
               You're Castor Troy... This is your
               old crew -- you don't take shit
               and you don't take no for an
               answer...


     INT. DIETRICH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous,
     in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor.

                             ALDO
               Helluva place, Dietrich.  So
               what's the big surprise?

     Archer emerges.  The men are stunned -- the women beam.

                             FITCH
               Are you crazy?  You're going to
               bring the Feds down on all of us!

                             ARCHER
               Archer doesn't want you, he wants
               me!  But I'm going to get him
               first -- with your help.

                             ALDO
               Archer's a damn celebrity now --
               he's untouchable -- and you're
               radioactive.

     He turns to leave.  Archer wheels him around and smashes
     him into the wall.  Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's
     too quick -- he strips him of it.

     The four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround
     Archer.

                             ARCHER
               You wanna face-off with Castor
               Troy?  Come on, then!  Come on!
               'Cause I've had a real bad day...

     Four against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer.
     One-by-one, the bodyguards back off.  Archer points the
     gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back.

                             ARCHER
               You're all forgetting who the real
               enemy is.
                      (to Aldo)
               Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled
               you in for questioning.  He
               rattled you so bad -- you shit
               your Armani suit right there in
               the interrogation room.

     Aldo blanches -- how did Castor know that?  Fitch laughs.

                             ARCHER
               You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer
               laughed at your last arraignment,
               when you got down on your knees
               and tried to blow your way to
               freedom.

     Stunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up.

                             DIETRICH
               We all have a reason to hate Jon
               Archer.  We all want to see him
               dead --

                             ARCHER
               And nobody's untouchable if we say
               he's not.

     The thugs exchange a glance... reading each other...
     considering.

                             DIETRICH
               It's all worked out.  Caz has
               Archer's routine down cold.

                             ARCHER
               We start with your basic
               kidnapping.  Then -- a little
               surgery.

                             FITCH
               Surgery?

                             ARCHER
               I'm going to rearrange his face in
               a way you won't believe.

                             ALDO
               You're an evil bitch, Caz.  But
               you've got balls of titanium.
               Count us in.

     Archer sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance.

                             DIETRICH
               Come on -- let's drink to it!


     FULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE

     Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high-
     ball glass filled with mescal.  he hands it to Archer.

                             DIETRICH
               How about one of your famous
               toasts, Caz?

     They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss.

                             ARCHER
               To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh --
               blow jobs?

     Silence -- then they crack up.  Reluctantly, Archer
     swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge
     to puke.

                             LIVIA
               Enough business, Caz.  Let's
               dance.

                             ARCHER
               Sorry... I don't...

     She drags him onto the glass floor.  Cindee puts on some
     MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin.  The girls start
     "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies.  He
     tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist.

                             LIVIA
               Remember the Charger's game, Caz?
               The owners box?  We did it four
               times.

                             ARCHER
               Sure I remember... Once a quarter,
               right?

     Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings.

     The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he
     starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he
     struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.

                             LIVIA
               Caz?  Are you okay?

     He pulls away and stumbles down the stairs -- toward the
     kitchen.

                             DIETRICH
               When even Castor Troy can't handle
               a tab of Quantrex...
                      (raises his glass)
               That, dear friends, is the first
               sorry whiff of old age.


     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Archer has his mouth under the tap -- drinking greedily.
     Woozy, he takes a breath... and notices a reflection in
     the window above the sink.  Archer turns to see -- Sasha.

                             ARCHER
               -- Sasha Hassler.  Age 35.  Met
               Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at
               Pearl Jam reunion...
                      (catches himself)
               Uh, how you doing, baby?

     She responds by slapping him -- hard.

                             SASHA
               What the hell are you doing here?
               You're supposed to be dead...

     He wobbles, then falls flat on his face.  Out cold.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - BALCONY - NIGHT

     Castor's chain-smoking, looking out over the city --
     wondering where Archer might be hiding.  But something
     breaks his rumination.  He sees --


     DOWN STREET

     A BMW pulls up to the curb.  The THUMPING MUSIC from
     within GOES QUIET, but no one emerges.


     EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

     Curious, Castor approaches the car, keeping a safe 
     distance.  He can see Jamie inside, struggling with Karl.

                             JAMIE
               No... Karl, please.

     He "shushes" Jamie -- but doesn't stop pawing her.

                             JAMIE
               My father -- he's got a gun --
               he'll -- he'll --

                             KARL
                      (pulls open belt)
               That wimp won't do shit.

     SMASH!  The passenger WINDOW EXPLODES inward.  Castor
     drags Karl out by his hair.  Jamie scrambles out and
     flees toward the house as...

                             CASTOR
               Who are you to call Jon Archer a
               wimp?

     Castor heaves Karl into the WINDSHIELD -- SPIDER-WEBBING 
     it.  Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind 
     the wheel.  The Beemer lurches away.


     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

     Castor enters to find Jamie, still shaken up.

                             CASTOR
               What are you -- stupid?

                             JAMIE
               That's just like you.  Some guy
               tries to rape me -- and you side
               with him.

                             CASTOR
               Did it look like I was siding with
               him?  Did it?
                      (she falls silent)
               You want to play with scummy organ
               grinders, you better be prepared.
               Do you have protection?

                             JAMIE
               You mean like... condoms?

                             CASTOR
               I mean like... protection.

     With a fluid motion, Castor expertly SNAPS open a well-
     oiled SWITCHBLADE and hands it to an astonished Jamie.

                             JAMIE
               For me?

                             CASTOR
               Next time -- slip it in low, then
               twist it -- so the wound doesn't
               close.

     She hugs him tight -- taking Castor by surprise.  But he
     responds momentarily.  About to pat her rump -- something
     makes him stop.

                             CASTOR
               Go on, get out of here.

     Jamie kisses him and heads up stairs.  After she's
     gone...

                             CASTOR
               No wonder he spent all his time
               chasing me.  Who can deal with
               this family shit?

     The PHONE RINGS.  He rushes to the den and picks it up.

                             CASTOR
               Jon Archer.
                      (immediately alert)
               Where is he?


     EXT. LOFT - ACROSS STREET - NIGHT

     Using night-vision goggles, Pollux watches Sasha close
     her drapes.  Visible in the b.g. on the sofa -- is
     Archer.

                             POLLUX
                      (into cell phone)
               -- I thought he might visit some
               old friends of yours.  And bro, if
               I didn't know better -- I'd swear
               this guy likes being you...


     INT. SASHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Archer wakens.  Sasha is tugging off his pants.

                             ARCHER
               Uh -- can't we just talk?

                             SASHA
               Talk?  The only talk I ever heard
               from you was 'take it off,' 'sit
               on it,' 'I'll pay you tomorrow.'

     She pulls out some fresh clothes -- and dumps them on
     him.

                             SASHA
               Take off the rest of those rags
               and get dressed.  Then get out.

                             ARCHER
               Not until I finish my business
               with your brother.

                             SASHA
               I told him to keep those creeps
               away -- but you're just too big an
               attraction.
                      (calming herself)
               Look, if the F.B.I. finds out
               you've been here -- I'll lose my
               son.  So please, just go.

     For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon --
     but a frightened, protective mother.  And he realizes the
     effect his own relentless obsession has had on her.

                             ARCHER
               I know I've done some things that
               made your life harder...

                             SASHA
               How would you?  You walked out and
               never looked back.

     ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling
     Sasha's deep-seated anger.  Archer finishes dressing.

                             ARCHER
               I'm not the same person you
               remember.  And for what it's
               worth, I'm sorry...

     Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a
     woman trying to hate someone she still loves.

                             ARCHER
               Not a bad fit.

                             SASHA
               They should.  They're yours.

                             ARCHER
               Nice-looking kid, too

                             SASHA
               Of course he is...

     Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil.
     Then...

                             SASHA
               Adam, come here... I want you to
               meet your father.

     Archer's face pales over in shock.


     EXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Their silhouettes are visible against the shades.

     PULL BACK...


     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes.

                             CASTOR
                      (into cellular)
               We've got him sighted.  Okay,
               Pollux, pull out.

                             BUZZ
               What makes you so sure this guy's
               gonna set up his own brother?

                             CASTOR
               I've never been more certain of
               anything.  Get everyone in
               position.  Remember -- shoot to
               kill.

     Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue."

                             BUZZ
               You heard the man -- let's saddle
               up!


     INT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy
     gaze.

                             ARCHER
               How old is he?

                             SASHA
               Five.  No one knows you're his
               father.  I thought someone might
               want to hurt him -- just to hurt
               you...

                             ADAM
               Bang!  Bang!  Bang!

     Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at
     them.  Upset, she takes it from his hands.

                             SASHA
               You know Mommy doesn't like you
               playing with these things...

     She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to
     Archer.  Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy.

     Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his
     big hands dwarfing the little boy's body.

                             SASHA
               You're not holding him right...
               Caz...

     Archer isn't hearing Sasha.  He's lost in his own
     memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER...
     a GUNSHOT...

     Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled.
     It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something 
     strong.  He regains control, dumping the child into 
     Sasha's arms.

                             ARCHER
               He's not my son.

                             SASHA
               Yes, he is -- !

     Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting 
     shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest 
     second.

                             ARCHER
               Get down!

     K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!  The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as 
     TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft.


     OUTSIDE

     across the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER.


     INT. UPPER LEVEL

     Chaos.  A bodyguard is mowed down.  Dietrich and the
     others scatter and hit the floor.


     KITCHEN

     Cindee and Fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the
     floor as the kitchen is decimated by GUNFIRE...


     SASHA'S BEDROOM

     Coughing, Archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward 
     the door.  He's almost out when...

                             SASHA
               Adam!

     Her wail of fear freezes Archer.  He looks back -- and
     sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm.

     Archer's face betrays his conflict.  A child -- but his
     worst enemy's child.

     BULLETS SHRED the WALL around Adam.  Getting closer.

     Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam.

     Just then -- a SWAT agent rappels in through one of the
     shattered windows, his weapon poised.  Archer kicks him
     hard, pitching him back through the window.

     Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body.  Thinking
     fast, he soaks his discarded T-shirt into a toppled
     flower vase -- then places it over Adam's face.
     Protecting him.

     He rushes to Sasha.  Together, they barrel through the
     soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route.


     INT. KITCHEN

     FIRING out the window, Fitch is riddled from outside by
     an agent as he CRASHES through the WINDOW.

     Cindee slashes the agent with a cleaver.  He FIRES --
     BLASTING Cindee into the refrigerator.


     LOWER LEVEL

     Archer hustles Sasha and Adam toward the staircase
     when --


     FRONT DOOR

     explodes open.  SWAT agents swarm to get in -- FIRING and
     throwing FLASH-GRENADES.


     ARCHER, SASHA AND ADAM

     are caught out in the open, when --


     UPPER LEVEL

     Dietrich, et al, open FIRE down on the attacking agents.
     Agents drop or are driven back out.


     SKYLIGHT

     BURSTS open and agents rappel down -- FIRING.  Aldo's
     bodyguard falls, riddled, off the upper level.


     LOWER LEVEL

     as one agent lands, Archer knocks his gun to the floor.
     They grapple.  As the agent reaches for it -- Adam
     appears and kicks the gun away.  Just like Mommy.


     SASHA

     scoops up the kicked weapon -- and cold-cocks another
     rappelling agent.  Then she FIRES, cutting a third
     rappelling agent's rope.  he drops hard to the floor --
     unconscious.

     Still grappling, Archer rips off the agent's gas-mask...

                             ARCHER
               Buzz...

     Buzz's eyes reveal only hatred.  He reaches for his
     knife.  Archer hesitates, then heaves Buzz through the 
     glass door.  He pushes Adam upstairs as more agents pour
     in the front door.

                             ARCHER
               Dietrich!  The painting!


     UPPER LEVEL

     Dietrich sees the canvas mural above the breached front
     door -- and understands.  He opens FIRE, cutting loose
     the mural.  It collapses, billowing -- and enshrouds the
     attacking agents -- and buying time.

                             DIETRICH
               Let's go!

     Archer and Sasha flee up the stairs.


     UPPER LEVEL

     Sasha sees Adam huddled in the middle of the glass floor
     -- the shadows of agents moving below.

                             SASHA
               Adam!


     LOWER LEVEL

     An agent aims his shotgun at the glass floor -- at the
     "target" kneeling on top of it.


     UPPER LEVEL

     Archer dives and grabs the boy as the GLASS FLOOR
     EXPLODES up.  He rolls through a shower of glass -- but
     comes up with Adam safely.

     Agents and thugs FIRE blindly upward and downward through
     the floor -- desperate to hit their targets.

     Agents open FIRE from the girders supporting the roof --
     cutting down Fitch's last bodyguard.

                             DIETRICH
               They're like cockroaches!

     Dietrich and Livia toss SMOKE GRENADES into the loft --
     covering their escape.


     TOP LEVEL

     Dietrich leads them to the very back of the loft.  He
     pulls open a hidden door.

                             DIETRICH
               If we make it, we'll meet up at my
               Malibu place.  You remember it,
               Caz?

                             ARCHER
               Off Kanan Road -- I know it.

     Archer hands Adam over to Sasha.  She hugs her little boy
     -- then embraces Archer tightly.  Hanging on -- near
     tears -- because she knows this may be the last time.

                             SASHA
               Thank you, Caz... thank you...

                             ARCHER
               Get the boy out of here...

     Livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out --


     INT. ROTUNDA - NIGHT

     MAC-10 poised, Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer
     through the deserted rotunda -- BOOM!  BOOM!  His escorts
     drop.

     Castor rushes down the staircase -- BLASTING at Archer.
     Unarmed, Archer instantly disappears behind one of the
     eight columns.  The columns are separated by mirrored-
     panels.

     Cat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column
     and mirror.  He spots Archer dead-ahead and BLASTS away!

     CRASH!  The MIRROR SHATTERS into a thousand pieces.

                             ARCHER (O.S.)
               That's about a thousand years bad
               luck...

     Castor whirls, spots Archer again and FIRES!  Another
     MIRROR.  Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and
     FIRES again -- this time BLASTING away his OWN
     REFLECTION.

     Then Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and
     onto Castor.  They battle for control of the pistol.

                             CASTOR
               It's too late, Jon.  Your kid
               loves me.  And your wife's an
               animal.  Even I can't keep up with
               her.

     They're so close Castor's whispering right in Archer's
     ear.

                             CASTOR
               Tonight I'm going to make her come
               like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate
               your death.

     Castor licks Archer's ear salaciously.  Enraged, Archer
     tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor.

     He's got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly BULLETS SHRED
     the world around him.  Archer staggers away as --

     Loomis enters -- FIRING his M-16 as Archer dives for a
     doorway.  Loomis FIRES the M-16's grenade launcher.

     BOOM!  The GRENADE EXPLODES -- the doorway bursts into
     flames -- but Archer has made it through.

     Loomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off
     angrily.  Castor can't follow through the flames.


     EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

     Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS
     force him to take cover behind the cupola.

     Pollux FIRES at him from the other side.

     Archer RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back.  Stand-off.

                             POLLUX
               Remember me?  Your 'baby brother'?

     Trying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the
     top of the cupola.

                             POLLUX
               You tricked me into telling you
               things I never told anyone...

     Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the
     crown.

                             POLLUX
               Now take it to your grave.

     Archer FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and
     SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Pollux's feet.  The cupola
     disintegrates beneath his weight.  He plunges down
     into --


     ROTUNDA

     Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the
     floor at his feet.

                             CASTOR
               Pollux...

     Pollux is almost gone.  Castor looks up and sees --


     ARCHER

     Peering down into the rotunda.


     CASTOR

     OPENS FIRE --


     ARCHER

     Ducks the bullets as he disappears.

     Castor desperately holds Pollux -- to no avail.  Pollux
     slips away... and dies.  He turns to Loomis...

                             CASTOR
               Get a medic -- now!

                             LOOMIS
               Forget him, sir.  It's only Pollux
               Troy...

     Castor snaps.  Without hesitation, he jerks up his GUN
     and PUTS a BULLET right in the middle of Loomis's
     forehead.

     Castor looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated
     as -- Buzz and Wanda arrive on the scene and see Loomis's 
     body.

                             WANDA
               What happened?

                             CASTOR
               What the fuck do you think
               happened?  Castor Troy just
               shot him!
                      (beat)
               What are you waiting for?  Go!

     After Buzz and Wanda take off -- Castor gathers Pollux up 
     in his arms -- totally devastated.


     INT. F.B.I - DAY

     Dazed, Castor approaches his office.  Kim proudly holds a
     copy of Time magazine.  His photo is on the cover.

                             KIM
               Sir -- you're on the cover of
               Time.  They're calling you 'An
               Authentic American Hero.'

     He just pushes by her and goes into his office.


     INT. FBI - ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and
     Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred.

     Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in
     his clenching grip.  He hurls it into other Archer family
     memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs.

     Only then does Castor notice Lazarro standing in the
     doorway.  For how long -- he can't be sure.

                             CASTOR
               What is it?

     Lazarro shuts the door behind him.

                             LAZARRO
               We were friends once, Jon, so I
               feel I owe it to you -- to tell
               you face-to-face...
                      (a beat)
               I don't care how much hype you're
               getting -- you're through.  After
               that massacre last night, I'm
               ordering a full inquiry into your
               recent erratic -- and deeply
               suspect -- behavior.

                             CASTOR
               Me -- 'erratic'?  Victor, what are
               you talking about?

     Castor casually closes the blinds between the offices.

                             LAZARRO
               You start meeting with Brodie and
               Miller.  Then they die
               mysteriously.  Your best friend is
               murdered -- and you don't seem to
               give a shit.
               Suddenly you're smoking, drinking,
               acting like a man with something
               to hide...
                      (beat)
               Maybe you've been bought -- maybe
               you've lost your mind.  But I
               promise... I'm going to find out.

     Eye to eye... Castor knows he can't finesse this one.

                             CASTOR
               Okay, Vic, I have a confession to
               make.  But you aren't gonna like
               it...
                      (wraps arm
                       around neck)
               I'm Castor Troy.

                             LAZARRO
               -- I don't understand...

     Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarro's chest.  He
     pleads for mercy as Castor pounds and pounds away at his
     heart -- until it finally seizes up.

     Lazarro twitches in a death throe, then slumps to the
     ground.

                             CASTOR
               Now you understand.

     He punches up the intercom button.

                             CASTOR
               Cancel my four o'clock.
                      (beat)
               And send for the paramedics.
               Victor Lazarro's having a heart
               attack.

     Castor fixes himself a shot of mescal.  He checks his
     watch -- as if counting -- then kneels beside Lazarro's
     body.

     The door flies open -- and two medics rush in.  They see
     Castor vigorously pumping Lazarro's chest -- "applying"
     CPR.

     The medics gently nudge Castor aside.  One medic takes
     Lazarro's pulse, then shakes his head.


     EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - DAY

     Castor peers down over the city... trying to collect
     himself.  He lights up a smoke... planning his next move.
     His meditation is broken as a police chopper circles
     above.

                                                MATCH CUT TO:


     EXT. CITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     LAPD choppers circle... squad cars prowl... cops and FBI
     agents set up roadblocks.  The city is being sealed off.


     EXT. DOWNTOWN - BROADWAY - DAY

     Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming
     undone... wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a
     trash can and carries it down the street in front of his
     face.

     Pedestrians gawk at this madman.  What's he doing?

     Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store.
     He swings the trash can.  SMASH!  The store's WINDOW
     SHATTERS.  An ALARM BLARES.

     Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned.  Then
     several youths leap into the window and start pulling
     merchandise out of the store.

     Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle.

     An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb.  A cop leaps
     out and chases as the looters scatter.

     The driver stands at his door, radio in hand.  Sensing
     something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister
     of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt.

     Archer sprays him in the face.  The cop gags and sags.
     Archer quickly slips behind the wheel.

     Inside:  Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows 
     darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside.  He
     HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away.


     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Archer slows the squad car.

     Up ahead:  Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main 
     road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic.

     Archer pulls off the road, out of sight.  He flips open 
     the portacomp and starts to type rapidly.


     INT. FBI - DAY

     A DISPATCHER'S SCANNER CLICKS to life.

                             DISPATCHER
               All units.  I have a confirmed
               code zero-zero priority alert.
               Proceed at once to Parthenia
               Street Terminal.  That's Parthenia
               at Nordhoff.


     QUICK SHOTS

     A)  MOTOR POOL

         Tac squads pile into armored Jeeps.

     B)  HELIPORT

         Choppers lift off and veer east.

     C)  ARCHER'S HOUSE

         The surveillance CARS ROAR away.


     EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

     Archer watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart 
     and screams east on the main road -- passing Archer.  
     Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west.


     EXT. ARCHER HOME - BACK YARD - DAY

     A plank in the fence swings aside as Archer slips into
     the yard.  He peers out from behind the garage.

     A cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO.

     Archer approaches the bird feeder.  Quietly, he sticks
     his hand inside -- and searches for the key.

     Just when he grabs it -- CAW-CAW -- an annoying BLUEBIRD
     hovers over Archer.  The cop looks over -- but Archer is
     gone.  All Lars sees is the bird.


     INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY

     Castor arrives.  Wanda is shocked to see him.

                             WANDA
               Commander, what are you doing
               here?

                             CASTOR
               Where should I be?
                      (looks around)
               Where's everyone else?

                             WANDA
               Backing you up!  Didn't you track
               Castor to the Parthenia Street
               Terminal?

                             CASTOR
               What?

                             WANDA
               You radioed in your personal
               security code.  Nobody knows that
               code but you.

                             CASTOR
               Obviously someone else knows it!
               Get everybody back to their
               posts -- now!


     INT. ARCHER HOME - SUNSET

     Archer tiptoes through the house -- listening.  He sees
     Cop #2 sitting at the dining room table, cleaning his
     pistol.  He slips upstairs -- toward the sound of
     RUNNING WATER.


     MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing 
     the bed.  He stops.  On top of the rumpled covers:  Eve's
     nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs.

     Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has
     stopped.  Eve steps in from the bathroom.

                             ARCHER
               Eve...

     The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality.
     She runs, but Archer grabs her.  She struggles -- 
     fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her 
     mouth covered.

                             ARCHER
               I'm not going to hurt you.  Just
               don't scream, okay?
                      (no response)
               Okay?

     Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her.

                             EVE
               I know you -- you're the one who
               called.  You're Castor Troy.  You
               killed my son --

                             ARCHER
               -- I called, but I'm not Castor.
               I'm your husband.

     Archer holds onto her as she struggles again.

                             ARCHER
               Now, you're going to listen.  The
               last time we saw each other -- was
               in this room.  We had a fight
               after I told you I had to go away.
                      (a beat)
               My assignment -- Jon Archer's
               assignment -- was to enter a
               federal prison as Castor Troy.

     Eve is startled by this intimate information but she 
     reveals nothing.  SIRENS approach the house, the cops are 
     returning.  She keeps an eye on the door.  Playing for 
     time.

                             EVE
               How did he expect to do that?

                             ARCHER
               An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor's
               face.  He handled the transplant,
               the vocal implant, everything.
               But somehow Castor came out of his
               coma -- and killed everyone who
               knew about the mission.  But not
               before he was transformed into me.

     The back DOOR CLICKS open.  A voice booms out.

                             COP (O.S.)
               Dr. Archer, are you okay?

                             ARCHER
               If you need hard evidence, get it.
               Your husband's blood type is O
               negative.  Castor's is A.B.

     Archer glances at the balcony -- as FOOTSTEPS CLOMP up 
     the stairs.  Eve is about to answer -- or scream.  But 
     then...

                             ARCHER
               Remember the parachute dream?  I'm
               falling, Eve... I'm falling...

     The blood drains from her face as... Archer slips over 
     the balcony and disappears.


     INT. STUDY - LATER

     Eve is at the computer -- dazed and disoriented.  She
     snaps alert on hearing the front DOOR OPEN -- Castor is
     giving orders to the cops guarding the house.

                             CASTOR (O.S.)
               I want you guys here around-the-
               clock.  And stay off the lawn.

     Eve feigns interest in her laptop as Castor enters.  She
     tenses as he starts massaging her back.

                             CASTOR
               You're all in knots.  Maybe
               another date night will help you
               relax...

                             EVE
               Not tonight... I'm way behind in
               my Continuing Ed.

     He studies Eve, then grasps her firmly by the shoulders.

                             CASTOR
               You think I've been acting
               strange.  Like a completely
               different person.

                             EVE
               -- Yes.

                             CASTOR
               Okay, I have a confession to make.
               But you aren't going to like it...

     Castor wraps his hands around her slender neck...

                             CASTOR (cont'd)
               ... I read your diary.  I've been
               trying to change -- trying to be
               more like the man you want me to
               be.

     Eve reacts to the explanation.  There is a logic to it.

                             CASTOR
               And to prove it, I'm taking you
               and Jamie away on a trip -- right
               after the memorial service.

                             EVE
               What memorial service?

                             CASTOR
               Victor Lazarro had a heart
               seizure... right in my office.  It
               was horrible...

                             EVE
               Oh, my God...

     Castor pours it on -- feigning immense grief.

                             CASTOR
               First Tito... now Victor...
                      (holds her tight)
               ... please don't tell me I'm going
               to lose you, too...

                             EVE
                      (returns the embrace)
               Of course not.


     INT. ARCHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Castor slumbers fitfully.  Suddenly, his shoulder
     twitches, rousing him.  He looks up to find Eve reading
     beside him.

                             CASTOR
               What was that?

                             EVE
               What was what?

                             CASTOR
               Something bit me.

                             EVE
               Probably a mosquito -- I'll close
               the window.

     Eve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep.  
     She gets up, closes the window, then goes into the
     bathroom.


     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Eve takes a breath, then produces a lancet from her
     pocket.  She squeezes the lancet -- and a drop of blood
     splashes into a glass vial -- Castor's blood.


     EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

     As Eve gets the key in her car door -- a hand grabs her.
     She stifles a scream -- then sees... the two COPS.

                             COP
               Sorry, Dr. Archer.  Where are you
               going at this hour?

                             EVE
               There's been an emergency at the
               hospital.

                             COP
               One of us will have to escort you.

                             EVE
               Fine...
                      (a beat)
               But please don't wake my
               husband... he's exhausted.


     EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Nothing happening here at 4 A.M.  Nothing indeed.  The
     bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in.


     INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Eve paces anxiously as the BLOOD ANALYZER CLICKS away.

                             EVE
               Please be O-neg.  Please...

     The MACHINE STOPS CLICKING.  It reads "Male -- Type AB."  
     She buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned.

                             ARCHER (O.S.)
               Thanks for believing me.

     Archer emerges from the darkness of her office -- but Eve
     pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority.

                             ARCHER
               What are you doing?  Where did you
               get that gun?

                             EVE
               I took it from my fake husband.

                             ARCHER
               Why point it at me?  I'm the real
               thing.

                             EVE
               I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's
               already dead.

                             ARCHER
               What more proof do you need?

                             EVE
               Tell me... tell me about the all-
               night dentist.

     As Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth.

                             ARCHER
               ... I took a date out for chicken
               and ribs -- not knowing she was a
               vegetarian.  When the night
               couldn't get worse, she broke
               her tooth on a pebble that got
               into her three-bean salad
               Somehow she and I had fun driving
               around looking for an all-night
               dentist...
                      (a beat)
               And even though it must have hurt
               -- you still kissed me.

     Eve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears.

                             EVE
               Christ, Jon!  How could you put us
               in this position?  Do you know --
               do you know what he did to me...?

                             ARCHER
               Whatever happened, whatever he did
               -- I know it's my fault and I know
               I can never make it up to you --

     She pulls herself together -- regaining her composure.

                             EVE
               But you're damn well going to try.
                      (a beat)
               First -- how are we going to get
               you out of this?


     INT. ARCHER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Castor wakes up and finds Eve gone.  His eyes narrow as
     he touches the mosquito bite -- the one that isn't there.


     INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Eve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow
     vial.

                             EVE
               This will knock him out for hours.

                             ARCHER
               Good.  What's his schedule
               tomorrow?

                             EVE
               He doesn't tell me anymore than
               you ever did... All I know is --
               tomorrow we're going to Victor's
               memorial service.

                             ARCHER
               Victor... Tito... they both died
               thinking I killed them... And in a
               way... I did.

                             EVE
               Jon -- you can't think about that
               now.

     Archer takes a breath -- and pulls himself together.

                             ARCHER
               -- What happens after the memorial?

                             EVE
               He's taking Jamie and me away.

                             ARCHER
               And neither of you will be coming
               back.  Where's the service?

                             EVE
               Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea.

     Archer reacts... the irony's not lost on him.

                             EVE
               What are you going to do?

                             ARCHER
               Hit him with a trank dart.  Once
               he's unconscious -- I'll try to
               get to Buzz and Wanda before the
               security team gets to me.

                             EVE
               What else can I do?

                             ARCHER
               Think up a good excuse.  I don't
               want you or Jamie anywhere near
               that service.

                             EVE
               I can cover for Jamie.  But if I'm
               not there, he'll suspect
               something...
                      (as Archer
                       considers)
               The second you make your move, all
               hell's going to break loose.  If
               I'm there beside him -- I can take
               charge.  I'm his wife, remember?
                      (a beat)
               There's no way around it -- for
               once, you need me.

     Archer looks into her eyes -- the regrets flooding over.

                             ARCHER
               I've always needed you...

     They embrace... soaking up each other's warmth.

                             EVE
               Jon -- what are the odds?

                             ARCHER
               Terrible.  But it's the best we
               can do with what we have.
                      (a beat)
               If it doesn't happen, take Jamie
               and don't look back...

                             EVE
               It'll happen.

     FOOTSTEPS APPROACH -- they break their embrace.

                             ARCHER
               Do doctors travel in packs?

                             EVE
               Only when we're golfing.


     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Castor and the twins round the bend -- just in time to
     see the door to the burn ward close.


     INT. BURN WARD - NIGHT

     Eve quickly wraps gauze around a patient's head -- when
     Castor and his boys rush in, guns leveled.

                             EVE
               Jon!  What are you doing here?

                             CASTOR
               That's what you're going to
               explain to me.

                             EVE
               Didn't the police tell you?  There
               was an emergency.

     Lars starts pulling at the patient's bandages.

                             EVE
               Jon -- stop it!  Mr. Alandro is
               very ill!

                             CASTOR
               Not as ill as he's going to be...

     He blanches as Lars reveals a scarred burn victim -- Mr.
     Alandro.  Eve is livid as she attends to the patient.

                             CASTOR
               Sorry.  But what's a guy to think
               when his wife runs off in the
               middle of the night?

                             EVE
               It's my fault.  I should've woken
               you up before I left.
                      (kisses him)
               Now please let me get back to
               work.

     They leave.  Eve wipes his ugly taste from her mouth.


     EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAWN

     Castor gets into his car as he confabs with the twins.

                             CASTOR
               Stay here.  Watch her like a hawk.

                             LARS
               Think she knows?

                             CASTOR
               Who cares?  She's going to be dead
               by tonight anyway.  They're all
               going to be dead.  The wife, the
               kid... and the father.


     EXT. OLD RANCH - HIGH GRASS - DAY

     Archer waits as Sasha appears with a long case.  In the
     b.g., Adam plays on the Ranch House porch with Dietrich.

                             ARCHER
               How's the boy?

                             SASHA
               His ears are still ringing -- but
               he'll be okay.

     Archer opens the case.  Inside is a sniper rifle.

                             SASHA
               The truck's all gassed up.
               Look, Caz, there'll be F.B.I.
               agents all over that place.  Maybe
               I can talk my brother into helping
               us.

                             ARCHER
               'Us'?  No, Sasha -- believe me,
               this isn't your fight.

     He turns to leave -- but her look draws him back.  He
     kisses her -- not passionately, but nobly.

                             ARCHER
               Thanks...

     She watches him as he walks off toward the truck.


     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY

     Dressed in staid black, Eve joins Castor at the limo.

                             CASTOR
               Where's Jamie?

                             EVE
               That's what I'd like to know.  She
               stole fifty dollars from my purse
               and took off.

     Castor's eyes narrow -- trying to read Eve.

                             EVE
               Don't act so stunned, Jon.  You
               know how hard it is to get that
               girl into a dress.

                             CASTOR
               I'll deal with her later.

                             EVE
               Good.  Because I am fed up.


     EXT. ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA - DAY

     A crucifix gleams in the sun... and anchoring the
     crucifix is... a headstone.

     Like so many others -- except this headstone is Matthew
     Archer's.  And hidden behind it is -- Jon Archer.  He
     finishes assembling the sniper rifle.

     For a moment he acknowledges Matthew's grave... the
     regrets giving way to determination.  He looks down from
     his vantage point onto --


     EXT. SEA-SIDE - DAY

     At the foot of the cemetery knoll.  Rows of chairs...
     white flowers... mourners.  A yacht is docked at the
     breakwater.

     INTERCUT WITH:


     ARCHER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

     peers down through scope -- seeing...

     Castor and Eve as they emerge from their limo.

     Eve glances around, searching for Archer.  She comes eye-
     to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move.

     Archer TRACKS Castor and Eve as they sit in the front
     row.  The ceremony begins.

                             PRIEST
               We are here to celebrate the life
               of Victor Lazarro.  We all know
               him as a man who dedicated himself
               to defending this great nation --
               first, as a highly decorated
               admiral -- then, as west coast
               director of the F.B.I.  But not
               all of you know what a deeply
               spiritual man he was.  It was his
               wish that his Requiem Mass be
               performed in Latin.
                      (a beat)
               In Nomine Patris, et Filii et
               Spiritus Sancti.  Amen...

     The PRIEST begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass.


     ARCHER

     fills the trank-dart with sedative.


     PRIEST

     continues the solemn ritual.

                             PRIEST
               Domine, de morte aeterna, in
               die illa tremenda quando caeli
               movendi sunt et terra...


     EVE

     checks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away...

     Castor absently pats her knee.  She's forced to return
     focus to the service.


     ARCHER

     chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and
     carefully peers over the crucifix.


     THROUGH SCOPE

     Archer TRACKS THROUGH the mourners -- and FINDS Castor.
     As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head...


     BACK TO SCENE

     We've come full circle from Matthew's death:  with Archer
     the sniper and Castor the target.

     The Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes.

                             PRIEST
               Requiem aeternam dona eis,
               Domine... Amen.


     FULL SCREEN - TRIGGER

     Archer's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze...


     POV THROUGH SCOPE - FIGURE

     crosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot.  Archer's
     finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling
     away from her face.  It's Jamie.


     AT SERVICE

     Eve stiffens as Jamie sits down.

                             JAMIE
               Thanks anyway, Mom --
                      (slides her $50)
               But I wanted to be here for you...
               and Dad.

     Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing.

     He simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in
     hers.

     The honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles,
     commencing their 21-GUN SALUTE as --


     ARCHER

     steadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle.

     He hears MOTION behind him.  Someone's coming and fast...
     but this is his only chance.  Off-balance, Archer
     squeezes --

     THFFFT!  The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the
     barrel.


     FOLLOW DART

     Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide.
     It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during
     the 21-GUN SALUTE.


     ON KNOLL

     THUMP!  Archer is cracked across the head.  He slumps
     down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters
     his ear.  As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we
     don't know when, or if, this pistol fires...


     AT SEA-SIDE SERVICE

     The honor guard presents the urn to Mrs. Lazarro.
     Fearful, Eve chances a glance around -- wondering what's
     gone wrong.

                             PRIEST
               The admiral's family will now take
               his ashes to the sea...

     As Mrs. Lazarro and her grown children proceed to the
     docked yacht, Castor touches his ear-phone...
     getting a message.

     His eyes alight on a boathouse... adjacent to the
     service.

                             CASTOR
                      (into headset)
               Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car
               around, then meet us at that
               boathouse...

     Guests head for their cars.  Eve seizes the moment and
     steps over to Wanda and Buzz.

                             EVE
               Wanda -- I need to talk to you.

                             WANDA
                      (reads her face)
               Sure... what's wrong?

     But then Eve looks past Wanda -- and sees Lars looking at
     her -- tightening his "friendly" grip on Jamie's
     shoulder.

                             EVE
               Never mind --

                             CASTOR
               Come on, baby.  I've got a
               surprise for you.

     Wanda and Buzz watch as they head up toward the
     boathouse.


     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     Dim, deserted.  Filled with boat parts, tools, etc.
     Castor hustles Eve inside and locks the door behind him.

     Lunt is there -- standing over a beaten Archer.  Eve
     gasps.

                             CASTOR
               Look who we caught creeping around
               -- Castor Troy.

                             EVE
               Why is he here?

                             CASTOR
               Before I turn him in, I thought
               we'd pay him back for everything
               he's put us through...

     Castor starts kicking Archer.  Over and over in the gut.

                             CASTOR
               Come on, baby.  Join the fun --

     Eve can't stand it.  She charges Castor -- but he
     immediately subdues her.

                             CASTOR
               Too bad.  Part of me was hoping
               you didn't know.

     He throws her down beside Archer.  She clings to him.

                             CASTOR
               Did you really think it would be
               that easy, you dumb fucks?
                      (to Eve)
               Sorry, baby.  Castor Troy is about
               to murder you and our daughter...
               but I promise you won't die
               unavenged.

                             ARCHER
               This is between you and me.  Leave
               them out of this.

                             CASTOR
               It was between you and me.  Even
               your little boy -- that wasn't
               supposed to happen.  But you
               couldn't let it go.

                             ARCHER
               No father could.

                             CASTOR
               Appealing to my sense of 'family'
               won't work, Jon.  I thought you
               knew me better than that

     Archer plays for time -- looking for some edge.  He sees
     a crate filled with block-and-tackle amid the shop's
     tools.

                             ARCHER
               I know some things that even you
               don't know, Caz.  You have a son.
               I've met him.  His name is Adam...

                             CASTOR
               I imagine I've got a dozen kids --
               so what?
                      (cocks pistol)
               No more head games... First your
               wife dies.  Then your daughter.
               Then you.

     Castor smiles as the DOOR CREAKS open.

                             CASTOR
               Just one big happy family...

     But it's not Jamie and Lars.  Three people emerge from
     the shadows, machine pistols poised.

                             CASTOR
               Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha?

                             DIETRICH
               That's right, Archer.  Now drop
               'em.

     No options.  Castor and Lunt drop their weapons.


     EXT. BOATHOUSE - SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

     Lars and Jamie pull up in the car.  Lars listens to his
     headset -- knows something is wrong.

                             LARS
               Don't fucking move...


     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     Sasha's at Archer's side.

                             SASHA
               Caz -- are you okay?

                             CASTOR
               You're making a mistake.  I'm
               Castor -- he's Archer.  Sasha,
               baby -- just give me a minute to
               explain!

                             SASHA
               That's pathetic, Archer.  But
               then, your terrible sense of humor
               is legendary.

                             ALDO
                      (cocks GUN)
               It's pay-back time.

     Aldo aims at Castor when BOOM!  He's blown apart.

     Lars charges in -- BLASTING.

     Archer grabs a block-and-tackle as --

     Lunt dives for Aldo's fallen machine-pistol.  Archer
     swings the block-and-tackle -- whacking Lunt across the
     head.

     Castor scoops up his pistol but Eve kicks him hard in the
     balls.  He doubles over.

     Archer snatches away the MACHINE PISTOL.  Staggered --
     Lunt is quickly riddled by Dietrich.

     Castor and Lars BLAZE at the now-scattering intruders --
     driving them back amid the shot's tools and drums.

                             ARCHER
               Find Jamie!

     Eve crawls through the FUSILLADE toward the exit.


     EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY

     Among the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert.
     Over the CRASHING of the WAVES -- did Wanda hear
     something?


     EXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     Eve rushes to the car -- it's empty.  Jamie is gone.

                             EVE
               Jamie?  Jamie!

     BULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her.


     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     During the GUN BATTLE -- we INTERCUT the deaths of
     Dietrich, Lars and Sasha WITH:


     EXT. SEA - LAZARRO'S ASHES

     being scattered at sea.

     Castor and Lars RIDDLE Sasha.  She drops.  Archer FIRES
     back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back.

     Archer leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha.

                             SASHA
               ... Help Adam... don't let him end
               up like us...

     She dies in his arms.  Wounded, Dietrich crawls over.
     Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror...

                             DIETRICH
               Sasha -- !

     BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Castor wastes Dietrich.  Archer BLASTS
     back -- driving Castor outside.  Archer pursues.


     EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY

     Eve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run.

                             WANDA
               We heard gunshots --

                             EVE
               Wanda, I've got to tell you
               something.  Something crazy...


     EXT. BOATHOUSE YARD - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats.
     Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun.

     Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths.
     Hearing a NOISE behind him --

     BOOM!  Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair
     hull.  He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when
     Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two
     steps -- until --

     Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps.

     The men collapse hard.  Castor's pistol clatters across
     the yard toward the docked boat.

     Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging
     their fingers deep into their throats.  They throttle
     each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is
     dislodged.

     His VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.  STATIC.

                             ARCHER
               Give up, Castor.  People are going
               to find out.

                             CASTOR
               Not if I kill you first.

     They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from
     the docked boat and picks it up.  Archer and Castor stop
     dead in their tracks because --

     Jamie appears, holding the pistol.

                             CASTOR
               Give it here, Jamie.

                             ARCHER
               No, Jamie.  Don't do it!

     Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now...

     Both speaking in Archer's true voice.

     And nobody is more confused than Jamie.

                             ARCHER
               Listen to my voice, Jamie.  I'm
               your father.

                             CASTOR
               It's a trick, Jamie.  I'm your
               father.

     Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled.

                             CASTOR
               Shoot him, Jamie.

                             ARCHER
               Jamie...

                             CASTOR
               Shoot him!

     Jamie FIRES.  Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his
     shoulder.  Castor snatches the PISTOL from Jamie's hand.

                             CASTOR
               You dunce.  No kid of mine would
               miss so badly.

     He aims the gun at Archer's head.

                             WANDA (O.S.)
               Hold it.

     Wanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns
     leveled.  Eve and more agents are right behind.

                             CASTOR
               Just saving the taxpayers the cost
               of a trial.  So take a hike.

                             WANDA
               You're both under arrest until a
               D.N.A. test proves who's who.

                             CASTOR
               I'm ordering you to back off!

     Several agents waver -- unsure.  But not Wanda and Buzz.

                             WANDA
               Put the gun down --

                             BUZZ
               -- Now!

                             CASTOR
                      (beat)
               Can't blame me for trying.

     He grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her
     chin.

     Archer struggles to his feet as --

     Castor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate
     to the garden.  Archer follows -- cautiously.

                             CASTOR
               Say goodbye to Daddy --

     Jamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's
     thigh and twists.  She dives away.  FIRING wildly, Castor
     staggers back through the gate.

                             CASTOR (O.S.)
               You ungrateful delinquent!


     OUTSIDE GATE


     As Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a
     confused security agent.

                             CASTOR
               Give me your weapon -- now!

     The agent hands over his UZI -- and Castor PLUGS him.


     BOATYARD

     Archer and Eve make sure Jamie's okay.

                             JAMIE
                      (to Archer)
               Who are you?  Will someone please
               tell me what's going on?

     Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open.


     CASTOR

     limps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive
     with sunbathers and yachters.


     EXT. MARINA DOCKS - DAY

     Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking
     for --

     Twin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by
     their suntanned crews.  He jumps into one of the boats.

                             BOAT CAPTAIN
               Hey -- !

     Without even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead.  In a
     flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT.  He sees --


     CASTOR'S POV

     Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat.


     CASTOR

     FIRES -- peppering the dock.

     Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT
     HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him.  Archer rolls into the boat --
     FIRING.

     Castor's hit!  A slug grazes his shoulder.  He grabs the
     THROTTLE -- taking off.


     ARCHER

     FIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit.  Castor BLASTS
     back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS.


     CIVILIAN BOAT

     speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Running parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER
     at point-blank range.  Their boats smash and pound each
     other.

     A police boat closes in on them.

     Castor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and
     boat.  The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's
     craft.

     Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other.  EXPLOSION!
     Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the
     water.

     The boat lands right next to Castor's.

     Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching
     a --


     TUG

     pulling a barge.

     Castor forces Archer into its path.  At the last
     moment...

     Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as --

     KA-BOOM!  Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which
     EXPLODES.


     CASTOR

     swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off.

     Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip.

     But the boat hits a wave...

     Castor loses the gun -- which skids away.  Archer slips,
     his head hanging over the side.  Castor tries to ram
     Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time.

     Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it.  WHUNK!  It sinks
     into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around
     his neck.

     As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts
     Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain.
     Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water.

     Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds
     toward --


     PIER

     Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT
     BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings.  But as they slug it out...


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     WHAM!  The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS
     straight for the shipyard.  COLLIDING with a shoreline
     obstruction --

     The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow...

     Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach.


     EXT. BEACH - DAY

     Archer and Castor lie dazed... then stir.  Castor sees
     the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it.
     But --

     Archer gets it first.  He aims it at Castor as they rise.

                             CASTOR
               You won't shoot me, Jon.  I'm
               unarmed...

                             ARCHER
               Okay, I have a confession to
               make... but you aren't gonna like
               it... You're right, I won't shoot
               you.  Not in the face anyway.

     BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!  He jerks and
     reels -- dropping to his knees.  He looks at Archer in
     total disbelief.  Then he sinks to the ground and lies
     still.

     Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop.  Then he turns
     and sees an FBI chopper heading his way.  Relieved, he
     turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone!

     Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning
     stabilizing screw.  Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the
     leg.  He buckles... but keeps going.

     Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to
     bury his face on the spinning blade.

                             CASTOR
               It'll never be over, Jon... every
               time you look in the mirror...
               you'll see my face...

     They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer,
     closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek.  At the last
     instant...

     Archer reaches the anchor-chain.  He wraps it around the
     screw -- stopping the whirling blades.

     Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer
     moves.

     Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his
     wedding ring.  Just when he almost has it off -- Castor
     suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight.

     Eye contact between the two men.  Castor smirks, his
     grasp slackening... as he finally fades away.  Archer
     lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own
     finger.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The chopper lands.  Buzz and Wanda rush over.

                             BUZZ
               You okay, Archer?

                             ARCHER
               What did you call me?

                             WANDA
               He called you 'Archer' -- sir.

     Archer finally realizes -- they actually mean him.  He
     smiles -- Jon Archer's long lost smile.


     EXT. SHIPYARD - SUNSET

     FBI med-teams strap Archer onto a gurney.  Castor's inert
     body is beside him.

                             EVE
               Hang on, Jon... they're bringing
               in their top surgical team from
               D.C...

                             ARCHER
                      (re:  Castor)
               How is he?

                             EVE
               No life signs at all.  He's a
               turnip.

                             ARCHER
               That's what they always say...

     He passes out as the FBI medics load him onto the med-
     evac chopper.  Wanda prevents Eve from climbing aboard.

                             WANDA
               I'm sorry, Eve.  You can't come.
                      (to Buzz)
               Take her home.

                             EVE
               But he's my husband!

                             WANDA
               But he works for us.

     Wanda gets on the med-evac chopper; it lifts off, leaving
     a furious Eve and a confused Jamie behind.

                             JAMIE
               Will Dad be Dad again?

                             EVE
               I hope so, honey.

                             JAMIE
               And you guys say my life is
               screwed up...

     In the swirl of dust, they watch the chopper fly away.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Maybe days, maybe weeks later -- no way to tell.  Eve is
     at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports.

     Sensing something, she looks up and sees a silhouette at
     the front screen door -- a man's silhouette.

                             ARCHER (O.S.)
               Hello, Eve.

     Pulse pounding, Eve frantically pushes open the door to
     glimpse the face of the man with Archer's voice.

     It's Jon Archer.  Eve stares -- then touches his face
     carefully, tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar.
     Then, she pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life.

                             JAMIE (O.S.)
               Dad?

     Jamie is there.  Archer smiles -- gently, almost sadly --
     with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could
     never feel, could never fake.

     She rushes to him.  The whole family hangs on, hugging
     and kissing -- for the first time ever, really together.

                             JAMIE
               I'm sorry I shot you, Dad.  Am I
               grounded?

     Archer smiles and holds her tighter.  But as they draw
     Archer inside, he hesitates.

                             ARCHER
               I have something to ask you -- to
               ask both of you...

     He steps aside -- revealing Castor's son.

                             ARCHER
               This is Adam.  He needs a place to
               live... just for a little while.

     Eve looks at Archer -- she sees what this means to him
     and, what the hell, there's plenty of time now to talk.


     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

     As the family heads inside, the door closes, shutting us
     out.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. MATTHEW'S OLD ROOM - NIGHT

     Archer gives Adam an old teddy bear -- rocking the child
     until he finally drifts off into dreamland.


     INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Archer watches Jamie sleep.  He draws the comforter over
     her -- she stirs, and pulls it in tighter.


     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Eve gets undressed... waiting for Archer.

                             EVE
               How was your first day back?

     No reply... Eve hears WATER RUNNING.  She approaches
     Archer, who's bent over the sink, washing his face.

                             EVE
               Jon?

     Archer stands up -- revealing Castor's face in the
     bathroom mirror.  Eve chokes back a scream.

     Archer turns and faces her -- with his true face.  He
     sees her terrified expression, turns back to the mirror
     -- and sees his own face looking at him.  But he
     understands.

     He embraces Eve... holds her tight.  She responds, happy
     to have him home again.  We STAY ON his familiar smile
     and...

                                                FADE OUT.

                    create fissile material for weapons
                    programs. But I'm not a scientist.

                    China. The high spec of these tubes
                    led us to conclude they were

                    The INR concluded late last year
                    that these tubes were probably for
                    artillery use, and the DOE agreed
                    they exactly matched those used by
                    Iraq for artillery rockets.

                              TURNER
                    WINPAC has them. We've examined
                    them. This is my point. None of you
                    guys has even seen the tubes.
          
                              VALERIE
                    I've seen them.
          
          Everyone looks at her.
          
                              TURNER
                    And when was that?
                                                                  26.

                              VALERIE
                    When I seized them last year in
                    Jordan. When I headed the covert
                    team that intercepted them, bought
                    back samples and delivered them to
                    you guys at WINPAC.
          
          A couple of the analysts try not to smile.
          
                              TURNER
                    So I take it you're not a nuclear
                    expert. These tubes are an EXACT
                    match for those developed by German
                    scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.
          
          Valerie turns to her notes from her reading.
          
                              VALERIE
                    You're right. I'm no nuclear
                    expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at
                    Virginia U atomic facility is. He
                    also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and
                    lives in Austria, and he told him
                    that the wall thickness of the
                    Iraqi tubes was three or four times
                    the thickness of his design.
          
                              PAUL
                    And the tubes are twice as long as
                    Zippe's design. In fact the only
                    similarity between his tubes and
                    the alumumium tubes is that they're
                    made of aluminium.

                    gas centrifuges since 1952.
          
          The chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for Valerie.
          Still Turner doesn't give up.
          
                              TURNER
                    I went to Vienna. Canada. I've
                    worked on this for months. They're
                    centrifuges. Fact.
          
                              PAUL
                    So basically, they're your tubes
                    and if we don't let you win you're
                    going home.
                                                                    27.
          
          
                              TURNER
                    That's pathetic.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Joe. No one is saying you're wrong
                    here. But if you're right, it's
                    huge. So we ask the question.

                    output of uranium. A sale that size
                    would leave a huge paper trail.

                    Any documentation would by law have
                    to be signed by the Prime Minister,
                    Foreign minister, and the Minister

                    How do you hide the transportation
                    of 500 tons of anything, let alone

                    except maybe one bush taxi. It

                    The droughts of the 80s and 90s
                    were met by millions of dollars of
                    U.S Aid, which continues to this
                    day. It just doesn't make sense
                    Niger would compromise this
                    lifeline. For that reason, and the
                    others I've given, it's my opinion
                    that the sale couldn't happen.

                    What if you're wrong? One guy says
                    it's true. It's not true. Lots of
                    guys say it's true, it's still not
                    true. It's intelligence. It's slow.
                    Painstaking. But it works. Checks

                    Mr. President, in your speeches now
                    you rarely talk or mention Osama
                    bin Laden. Why is that?

                    The idea of focusing on one person

                    Well. This is indeed a strange
                    morning. Madam, there seems to have

          His shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to

                     proofing the tubes. Plus the tubes
                     are roughly twice too long. Now you
                     could argue that that's to disguise

                    Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear
                    scientists are among the most
                    boring people on the planet. They
                    can talk about gas centrifuges
                    until you want to jump out of a
                    window. And maybe once every ten
                    years someone comes along and says
                    "so, tell me about gas
                    centrifuges". That's literally the
                    only time you should listen to
                    these guys. If they say an
                    aluminium tube is not for a gas
                    centrifuge it's like a fish talking
                    about water. We've been over this

                    sufficiently high specification to
                    make a nuclear bomb. He had fissile

          Full military funeral, in the rain. A hundred mourners from
          Langley. Some uniformed. A coffin draped in the flag

          A hymn is sung. In the bleechers, the analyst from the
          meeting earlier, pauses in the break between verses and
          squints through the rain at the bank of seats across the
          grave.
          
          OVER THERE is THE LANGLEY TOP BRASS. JIM PAVITT. Next to him,
          GEORGE TENET, DCI. Next to him...... of all people.... JOE

                    Didn't you hear? Friday the DCI
                    took him to the White House. He
                    briefed the President on Aluminum

          Turner is over there, singing the hymn, rubbing shoulders
          with the good and the great.
          
          AT THE BACK -- Valerie stands with a number of other agents,
          MIKE and BILL, her Chief. A lone bugler and marine drummer
          beat out a last post. A widow weeps.

                    So we've got a list of names. The

                    night and day. Their houses are

                    You get through the checkpoints and
                    roadblocks. You show up in my

                    with an armed tac team ask me to
                    help out Uncle Sam? I'm going to

          Joe comes downstairs...Valerie is by the front door, dressed,
          cinched black mack, suitcase.

                    I gotta go. I have to be at the

          Joe, still half-asleep, catches up.

                    I left a post-it by the lamp. Its
                    all on the post-it.
          
                              JOE
                    Right. Its on the post-it.

                              JOE
                    We've been leaving post-its for
                    each other for months now.. we talk

                    I don't know where you go. Who you
                    meet. If you're in some jail, or
                    lying in some ditch in Jordan,
                    Beirut. And if you go missing, I
                    can't tell anyone because you were
                    never there. I'd never know what
                    happened. I don't know where you
                    go.

                    It's on the Post-It.

                    Have a nice day.
          
          She shuts the door, leaving Joe alone. He walks through to
          the kitchen, looks at the fridge, one by one he takes all the
          notes off, then, deliberately, drops them in the bin.

                    in `83, he came here for an
                    engineering conference. Twice in
                    twenty five years. We try to stay
                    in contact. It's difficult.

                    I won't do anything to help you. I
                    don't know you. I would only do
                    this for Sa'ad.

          He carries one into THE BEDROOM and hands it to Sawsan, who
          sits on the edge of a bed wearing a long black traditional
          Abaya. There are two other agents there, with Valerie. One of
          them is holding a notebook..

                    The pages of this notebook are fast
                    burning. You write on them like
                    normal, but if you need to destroy
                    them in an emergency..
          
          He whips out a zippo. Sets fire to one. It's gone in a flash.

                    You have two of these in your

                    we want you to use..
          
          The other agent shows her a pen.

                    The ink in this pen is visible for

                    - I am not taking any of this. If
                    the Mukhbarat find any of this they
                    will do things to me you cannot

                               AGENT 2
                    Ma'am, we have 50 very specific
                    questions, some extremely
                    technical.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    You have 206 different bones in
                    your body. Do you want their names
                    in english, latin or arabic?
          
          They look to Val for a decision. She can't help but smile.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          Later. The agents have gone. Just Sawsan and Valerie.
          
                              VALERIE
                    How do you feel?
          
          She's trying to drink her tea, but she's shaking. Val takes
          her hand and silently grips it.
                                                                     46.
          
          
                              VALERIE
                    Just remember, if anyone asks you
                    anything, if anyone stops you stay
                    calm and tell the truth. You're
                    just visiting your brother. Keep it
                    simple and keep to the truth.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    Except it's not the truth.
                    How do you do it?
          
          She searches Valerie's face.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    How do you be someone you're not?
                    How do you lie to someone? To their
                    face. How do you do it?
          
          Valerie looks at her. Before she can answer we --

          OUTSIDE -- Ali checks his watch. Knocks on the door. Opens
          it. Valerie and Sawsan look up from the edge of bed.

          A taxi cab stops and SAWSAN is helped out by the driver.
          
          From a car across the street -- Valerie watches:
          
          Sawsan rolls her suitcase into the terminal. At the door she
          glances behind her...and disappears inside.
          
          Ali and Valerie get out the car looking every bit like
          tourists, suitcases, sunglasses, guidebook etc.

          Valerie and Ali enter the revolving doors and follow her at a
          distance across the shiny beige and gold marble floors.
          
          By the the check in desk for the Gulf Air flight to Baghdad
          stand TWO MOUSTACHIOED MEN in dark suits.
          
          Valerie and Ali have stopped in a electronic goods store.

          Valerie aims her zoom lens camera and as if appraising it as
          a purchase, firing off some shots of the Iraqi agents.
          
          Sawsan reaches the desk and is stopped by the two men.
          
          They watch her talking to the men, handing over her passport.

          The Iraqi agent stares at her. He asks a question in arabic
          No subtitles. Sawsan responds. She remains cool, almost
          disinterested. The men exchange sentences of arabic.
          
                                                            BACK TO:
          
          Valerie watches from a distance. Heart beating. At last they
          allow Sawsan through, she checks onto the flight.

                      Hussein's regime is a danger to the
                      United States and to its allies, to
                      our interests. The problem here is
                      that there will always be some

                    Basically Saddam bought all these
                    tubes. And we've nailed him. We got
                    them. They're packed with uranium.
          
                              STEVE
                    They're not packed with uranium.

                    Right. They're for purifying it.
                    The bomb comes later. It's how you
                    boil it up it to make the big one.

                    Joe you know about this stuff, what
                    do you think they're for. These
                    tubes. What's your hunch?

                    Well Jeff. I don't know anything
                    about these tubes. I'm not
                    qualified. But I suppose the real

                    It's a pretext! 50% of Americans
                    think Saddam blew up the Towers-
          
          The table erupts in discussion, leaving Joe marooned. Valerie
          spots it instantly, as he broods.

                    he's not a threat.

                    stopped Hitler in the thirties-
          
          Joe sits there. Fuming.
          
                              FRED
                    He's not Hitler. He's Saddam. We
                    put him there. Why? It suited us.
                    He's our fault. Always was.
          
          Right on cue, Joe rounds on the hapless FRED.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    Have you met him? Fred. Have you
                    met Saddam? Have you looked him in
                    the eye? Did he threaten you? Did
                    he threaten to kill you? You don't
                    know Saddam. You don't know what
                    you're talking about.

          Alone, Sawsan rolls her small suitcase across the polished
          floor past a group of Iraqi soldiers. A Saddam-a-like in a
          dark suit takes her passport. His eyes bore into her.

          out of the queue, down a strip lit corridor and into a
          windowless room in bowels of the airport.

          Hands search through her luggage. They unwrap a framed
          photograph of SAWSAN and her daughter, smiling. The officer
          turns it over in his hands.

          she is surrounded by hugs and tears and laughter.
          
          Sawsan removes the framed photograph of her and her daughter.
          It is cooed over then given pride of place on the mantel.

                    This is insane. We don't have spare

                      Ambassador Wilson is the last
                      American diplomat to meet with
                      Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when
                      Saddam threatened to execute anyone
                      sheltering foreigners, Wilson
                      appeared at a press conference
                      wearing a noose around his neck,
                      declaring, "If the choice is to
                      allow Americans to be taken hostage
                      or be executed, I will bring my own
                      fucking rope." Saddam backed down
                      and Wilson evacuated several
                      thousand. He came home and was
                      taken to the Oval Office where the
                      President introduced him to the War
                      Cabinet as an American hero.

                      That's not quite true. It wasn't

                    Sawsan's brother worked with five
                    hundred scientists at the Safa
                    factory. In `91 it was blanket
                    bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel,
                    Saddam's son in law, kept the
                    scientists together, threatening to
                    kill them if they tried to leave.
                    But sanctions destroyed the
                    economy, and when Kamel was
                    executed in `95, the team just
                    drifted apart. They're all say the

                              JOE
                    I haven't seen the intelligence.
                    I'm not qualified to comment. We
                    have intelligence services working
                    hard to assess just this. But I
                    have met Saddam. I've looked him in
                    the eye, so I can tell you what I
                    saw. During a particularly vicious
                    period of bloodletting in the late
                    eighties, Saddam was asked by his
                    foreign minister why he had
                    executed a certain official who had
                    been a loyal supporter. He said he
                    would rather kill a friend in error
                    than allow an enemy to live. For
                    me, that is the mark of a monster.

                    on five different methods of enriching
                    uranium for a bomb. The British

                      Retired Ambassador Joe Wilson
                      yesterday claimed in a piece in the
                      New York Times that the President
                      mispoke in his State of the Union
                      Address in January, concerning
                      claims that Saddam sought 500 tons
                      of Yellowcake from Niger. Wilson,
                      who was acting Ambassador in Iraq

                                MR. FLEISCHER:
                      Look. There's zero, nada, nothing,
                      new here. The President's statement
                      in the State of the Union was much
                      broader than the Niger question.

                      Is the President's statement
                      correct?
          
                                FLEISCHER:
                      Yes, I see nothing that goes
                      broader that would indicate that
                      there was no basis to the
                      President's broader statement. But
                      specifically on the yellow cake,
                      the yellow cake for Niger, we've
                      acknowledged that that information
                      did turn out to be a forgery.

                                 FLEISCHER:
                      We see nothing that would dissuade
                      us from the President's broader
                      statement.

          INT. DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS OFFICE. DAY.
          
          Valerie sits stock still in front of a large desk at Langley.
          
          The door opens. The DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS enters with a
          fifty something woman. He sits at the desk. She sits next to
          him. BEHIND HER -- in the corner, sits a third man. He
          doesn't speak.
          
                              DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS
                    Good morning. Please..sit down.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Good morning Sir. Ma'am.
          
                              DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS
                    Working backwards, we need a matrix
                    of everyone you've come into
                    contact with in a covert capacity
                    back to January 2001.
          
                              VALERIE
                    I've already started a list Sir.
          
                              DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS
                    Good. We need to get an idea..fast,
                    of how much this thing bleeds.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Sir, I have several live ops at
                    crucial stages, people in the field
                    in critical windows of operation-

                    Then come back here. Don't do
                    anything else.
          
          She opens her mouth. Nothing comes out.
                                                                     76.

          Behind her, the Internal security guy stands.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR. DAY.
          
          Valerie comes out, followed by security. She goes left.
          
                              INTERNAL SECURITY
                    This way please.
          
          She turns and follows him. As she passes desks, she can feel
          people looking at her. The news has spread fast.
          
          INT. EMPTY OFFICE. DAY
          
          Valerie enters an empty office. The door is closed behind
          her. On the desk is a notepad and a telephone. She sits.
          
          She picks up the phone. The phone isn't connected.
          
          She sits staring at the blank page.
          
          SUDDENLY -- She gets up and walks out. At the end of the
          corridor: the Internal security guy follows.

                    Ms Plame.
          
          He breaks into a run. The doors close on him.
          
          INT. CPD OFFICE, BASEMENT, LANGLEY. DAY.
          
          Valerie comes out of the elevator and walks fast. People
          looking at her. Her colleagues. Eyes. Whispers. All around.
          
          Bursting into her office, she sits. Starts typing fast. She
          tries to access her Joint Task Force database.

          The INTERNAL SECURITY stands outside.
          
          Valerie looks up. She sees Mike passing the doorway.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Mike. We need to get a message to

          INTERNAL SECURITY watches him closely.

                    Sorry. I have to go.
          
          He goes inside and closes his door.

                    Valerie.
          
          HER CHIEF is standing there. He beckons her into his office.
          She approaches. The Internal Security guy tries to join them.
          Bill puts a hand to his chest.
          
                              BILL
                    Go fuck yourself.

          He hangs up. Valerie enters. The twins run out of the lounge
          towards her. She goes into mom mode.
          
                              VALERIE

          They go into the kitchen. Joe follows. The kids fight for her
          attention to show drawings they've done.
                                                                   79.

          She opens the second box: Different currencies. Credit cards,

          American. A couple Canadian. EU. She looks at the photos.
          Different names. Hair colour. She puts them back in the box.

                              SAWSAN
                    Sa'ad's colleagues. Dr Habbuck was
                    shot dead in the street. Dr Falli
                    was murdered in his hallway.
                    They're killing them.
          
                              VALERIE
                    Sawsan, listen to me-
          
                              SAWSAN
                    I know you can't tell me where he
                    is. Just tell me you have him. I
                    beg you. Please. I don't need to
                    know anything. Just tell me he's
                    safe.. He's my little brother.
                    Please. If you have him, if he's
                    somewhere...
                        (She starts to cry.)
                    Please. Please, I beg you. Do you
                    have him. I have to know.
          
          Valerie speaks quietly.
          
                              VALERIE
                    We don't have him.
          
          Sawsan closes her eyes. She sobs.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    You said he would be safe. You said
                    we would help. You promised-
          
          VALERIE approaches. Sawsan withdraws.
          
                              SAWSAN
                    I trusted you.

          She turns her back and walks away. Leaving Valerie alone.

          Valerie's boss MIKE is watching TV with his wife and kids and
          her mother, when the doorbell rings. He gets up.
          
          The front door opens. Valerie is standing there.

                    Valerie. What are you doing here?
          
          Mike steps forward and closes his front door. Mike glances up
          and down the street.

          A garage door opens. Valerie and Mike step into his garage
          and fluorescent light flickers on to reveal boxes of
          Christmas decorations etc-

                    I don't know what you're talking
                    about.
          
          She fixes him. Eventually he shrugs.
          
                              MIKE
                        (He shrugs)
                    You were right. It's all about the
                    scientists. We made a call.

                               MIKE
                    We passed your case files to

                    great at this stuff.

          Valerie gets in her car. Shaking. Shuts the door. She holds

                    marched out of White House in

                    I know it's not easy for you, but I
                    want you to know how much the
                    agency appreciates your silence in
                    the light of this matter. We know
                    how damaging this has been to you.
                    We can't afford for this knife
                    fight to go on any longer.

                    People threatening to kill my
                    husband. Hurt my children. I went
                    to the agency and I requested
                    security to protect my family. It
                    was declined. Because quote "My
                    circumstances fall outside budget
                    protocols." If this is a knife
                    fight, right now, Sir - we're

                    Well, all I can say is Good Luck.
                    But as a friend, I feel I should
                    tell you that those men..
          
          He points down the hill at the White House.

                    the most powerful men in the
                    history of the world. How much of a
                    stretch do you think it would be
                    for them to take on Joe Wilson?

                    they don't.

                    It's the White House Joe. You
                    seriously think you can pick a
                    fight with the White House and win.
                    They'll bury us.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    They'll bury us if we don't.
                    How loud can you shout Val? Say we
                    get in an argument you think you're
                    right, and I think your wrong. You
                    start making your point with all
                    your might, and I start shouting
                    back, except I'm the White House,
                    and I can a shout a million times
                    louder. Does that make me right?
                    They lied Val. That's the truth.

                    Today Special Prosecutor Patrick
                    Fitzgerald, in charge of the
                    enquiry into the leaking of the
                    identity of a covert agent
                    announced that he is convening a
                    Grand Jury to investigate the
                    affair. Among the blizzard of
                    subpoenas issued are ones for the
                    Vice President's chief of Staff
                    Scooter Libby, and special advisor
                    to the President Karl Rove. Both
                    men are under suspicion of having
                    leaked the agent's name to
                    reporters in order to damage former
                    Ambassador Joseph Wilson, a vocal
                    and combative critic of the
                    administration. It is believed that
                    the President himself has been
                    questioned under oath by the FBI.

                    That is the Senate Select Committee
                    on Intelligence. On page thirty six
                    it says "the former ambassador's
                    wife offered up his name" and
                    includes a memorandum written by
                    Valerie Plame which says quote "my
                    husband has good relations with
                    both the prime minister and the
                    former Minister of Mines, both of
                    whom could possibly shed light on
                    this sort of activity." I've spent
                    a whole year denying just this.

                              REPORTER
                    Mr. Wilson is it true you donated
                    money to the Kerry campaign?
          
                              REPORTER
                    People are saying your wife does
                    not actually work for the CIA.
          
                              REPORTER
                    Is it true she was just a secretary
                    at Langley?
                                                                     99.
          
          
          Joe turns round, furious, as if he's going to punch the
          reporter. He tenses his jaw.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    No comment.
          
          Joe gets into his car. The questions roaring around him.
          
          INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
          
          Valerie is alone. In bed. Watching TV. FOX NEWS. Rogers.
          
                              GUEST
                    The question still remains, who is
                    Valerie Plame? Was she really
                    simply a glorified typist?
          
                              ROGERS
                    Well, I think it's really all about
                    the money. We're talking about a
                    third-rate CIA agent who had a
                    government salary, and she had sent
                    her husband to Niger, and he had
                    come back and didn't give the
                    report to the CIA, but he turned it
                    over in an op-ed to The New York
                    Times. So she was already in the
                    hot seat with the CIA, and so now
                    she's all about the money. Plus
                    it's come out that she was
                    considered kind of a mediocre agent
                    at best.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
          
          Joe puts a sheet on the couch. He looks around for something
          to use as a pillow.
          
          INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
          
          Joe comes into the bedroom to get his pillow. Valerie is
          lying in the bed, turned away. He pauses in the doorway.
          
          We see Valerie up close. She begins to speak.
          
                              VALERIE
                    When we were at the "Farm",
                    training to be field officers, they
                    picked four or five of us and told
                    us we'd stood out.
          
          FLASH---- Valerie, kneeling, blindfold, in stress position.
          
                                                           BACK TO:
                                                                 100.
          
          
                              VALERIE
                    We were bound, hooded and thrown in
                    separate cells. They beat us.
                    Deprived us of sleep. All you had
                    to do was give up the name of one
                    of the others. Just one name. For a
                    glass of water. A sandwich. To
                    avoid another punch.
          
          FLASH -- A CAR BATTERY IS CONNECTED.. SZZZZZZ!
          
                              VALERIE
                    Another hour in a stress position.
          
          FLASH -- VALERIE bursts out from under the water. Gasps in a
          draft of air.
          
                              VALERIE
                    They push you until they find it.
                    Til they find the point at which
                    you break. Because they have to
                    know. You have to know. And one by
                    one, everybody broke. Except me. I
                    never broke.
                        (she looks at him)
                    I've been in situations, places
                    where I was afraid. Where if you
                    made a mistake, one tiny mistake,
                    at any moment..
                        (Pause)
                    But I never made a mistake. And
                    that made me feel special. I
                    thought: I'm Different. Bullet-
                    proof. You can't break me. I don't
                    have a breaking point.
                        (Pause)
                    I was wrong.
          
          Joe comes over. He reaches out and touches Valerie.
          Immediately she gets up and walks out.
          
          Alone, he hears the bathroom door close.
          
          ESTABLISHING. CHARLESTON TERRACE. DAY --
          
          INT. UPSTAIRS, WILSON HOUSE. DAY.
          
          Valerie packs the kids stuff up into suitcases.
          
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS. JOE'S STUDY. DAY.
          
          Joe sits at his desk, a book open. Not reading.
                                                                   101.
          
          
          Valerie puts the kid's coats on. The study door is open. She
          knows Joe is there but she doesn't look at him nor he at her.
          
                              VALERIE
                    OK. Say goodbye to your father.
          
          The kids go into -- THE STUDY -- Joe looks up.
          
                                 JOE WILSON
                    Hey guys.

                    Why aren't you coming daddy.
          
          It hits him in the gut.
          
                                 JOE WILSON
                    Come here.
          
          He scoops them up. Kisses him. Her.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    I'll see you both real soon OK?
          
          In the hallway Valerie waits.
          
                              VALERIE
                    OK guys. C'mon.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          On the driveway, VALERIE puts the kids in the car.
          
          INSIDE -- Joe sits there, not looking as the car pulls away.
          
          EXT. HUNTSVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA. DAY
          
          Valerie gets out of the car. The kids run to hug Grandma and
          Grandpa.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY.
          
          Valerie's mom coralls the kids.
          
                              VALERIE'S MOM
                    Who wants to make toffee apples?
          
                                 KIDS
                    Me! Me!
          
          Val looks downstairs. In the shop, her father, in an apron.
                                                                 102.

                      Well don't just stand there. Come
                      take a look.
          
          INT. BASEMENT WORKSHOP. DAY.
          
          A wide workbench. Tools in neat rows. Valerie's father, an
          old man in a plaid shirt holds a sander. Points to the table
          he's working on.
          
                                LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
                      It's cherry. I thought it'd work in
                      your dining room. I can see the
                      great and the good of Washington
                      eating off this thing for years to
                      come. Just sanding her down then
                      she done.
          
                                VALERIE
                      It's beautiful.
          
                                VALERIE'S MOM
                          (calling down)
                      Sam. I keep telling you. They have
                      a table.
          
          Valerie smiles at her Dad who looks at her properly.
          
                                LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
                      Well come here.
          
          They hug.
          
          INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL. DAY.
          
          Joe walks across the floor. He shakes hands with three or
          four businessmen.
          
                                JOE WILSON
                      Good morning.
          
          They all introduce themselves. Joe orders breakfast.

                      She's fine. She's well. She uh..
          
          He uses the waitress to change the subject.
          
                                JOE WILSON
                      Hi. I'll just have a strong coffee.

          Joe washing his hands in the bathroom. Tense. He looks tired.

          Joe comes out of the bathroom and walks across the foyer and
          back to his table. A woman is talking to his business
          associates. He sees who it is, instantly looks concerned.
          
                              JOE
                    Can I help you? Excuse me. Can I

                    He is in the pay of left wing hate

                    has stabbed our troops the back.
          
          Joe is trying to laugh it off. But everyone is watching.
          
                              JOE

                                           You are a fraud and your wife

                    OK.   Leave my fucking table. Now.
                    How   dare you talk about my wife?
                    You   don't know her. You don't know

          Joe storms away. OUT OF THE FOUR SEASONS

          The driver drives. Joe tries to calm down, but in the back of
          this cab, it all hits him and he starts to lose it. He looks
          sick. His head is exploding. The tension like a vice. He
          opens the window. He gets himself under control, but he's
          white and shaking. The cab driver looks in the rear-view.

                    You OK?
          
                                JOE WILSON
                    I'm fine.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    You're him. I see you on the TV.
                    You're Joe Wilson.
          
                              JOE
                    No, I'm not.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    Yes brother. I see you on the TV.

                              JOE WILSON
                    That's somebody else.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    No no. I know you. My name is Joe
                    too. I am from Sierra Leone.
                    Freetown. You've been there, right.
                    You like Freetown?
          
          Joe looks out of the window.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    Joe, we both know Freetown's a shit-
                    hole.
          
          The taxi driver cracks up.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    That's the truth. That's the truth
                    right there, brother. Yes indeed.
                    Sierra Leone is dying. The people
                    at the top have too much power. WAY
                    too much power. Over there we have
                    no truth. Just power. People can't
                    see that from here. Over here it's
                    a different world.
          
          Joe stares out the window.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    I wouldn't be so sure of that.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    How can you say that? Land of the
                    Free, brother. Home of the Brave.
          
          Joe looks sick.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    Can we pull over. I'm going to
                    walk. Look keep the change.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    Do you pray, Joe Wilson?
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    No.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    I give you this. It is my church
                    maybe you come. And if you open a
                    bible, look John Chapter eight.

          Valerie's father is teaching the kids how to lassoo a pole.
          They both want to go first. He tries to keep the peace.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN -- Valerie and her mother watch.
          
                              VALERIE

                    Shakin' through.
          
          OUT IN THE FIELD -- Val's Dad lassoos the pole. Kids cheer.

          Sunset. Midges swirl in dizzy soups. Out in the field,
          Samantha is trying to lassoo the pole. Valerie comes out and
          joins her father on the porch. He suddenly points.

                    OK. See those birds. Those guys.
                    Those yellow fellas. See `em..
          
                              VALERIE
                    Yeah I see `em.
          
                              LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
                    OK. Listen.
                        (They both listen)
                    You hear that? Ain't that
                    beautiful. They suddenly showed up
                    last year. They're called..
                        (Stops)
                    What are they called? I know their
                    name. They're called something.
                        (He wracks his brain)
                    Anyway. They were here last year.
                    And the year before. God they're
                    beautiful. Look at that.
                                                                  107.

          The sun setting. Samantha playing below. He nods slowly.

                    Well. I know my little girl doesn't
                    say anything til she absolutely has
                    to.
          
          Tears come to her eyes.
          
                              LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
                    I'm the same way. And I've said
                    that too. Those exact same words.
                    July 1972. Your mother and I were
                    fighting all the time. I guess she
                    was just plain tired of moving
                    home. Wasn't `til I retired after
                    42 years in the Air Force, I
                    realised we never had a home.
                    Germany, Singapore, Australia,
                    England. Heck I can remember the
                    day you were born in a freezing
                    cold airbase outside Anchorage
                    Alaska. You must have been to
                    twenty schools. Twenty different
                    chances to introduce yourself. Be
                    someone new. But you turned out OK.
                    Responsible. A little too serious.
                    Always looking down the road.
                    Worrying where life was going to
                    drag you next. But it made you
                    tough. Real tough. Maybe tougher
                    than I, or your mother, or anyone
                    knows.
          
                              VALERIE
                    He wants me to go on the record.
                    Speak out. Like that would suddenly
                    make this all go away. We can't
                    even speak to each other.
                        (She shakes her head)
                    I can't see how this comes round. I
                    just can't see it, pop. Not
                    anymore.
          
          He looks at her. With a serious intent. He speak low.
          
                              LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
                    What they did was wrong Valerie.
                    Plain wrong. Never forget that.
                                                                  108.
          
          
          Valerie look at the floor as her father's words sink in.

                    Say through some miracle you even
                    get through this.. you and Joe are
                    always gonna fight. You're
                    fighters. He's a stubborn son of a
                    bitch too. He don't give up easy
                    either.
          
          A dark cloud comes over him. He speaks levelly.
          
                              LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME
                    One day this country is gonna look
                    back on these years, and it's gonna
                    hang its head. It's gonna weep.
                    Then it's gonna stand up straight
                    and walk on.
          
          He watches Samantha in the half-light, still trying to lassoo
          the pole.

                    I swear to God, she's gonna keep at
                    that until she licks it.
          
          Valerie smiles. He points to Samantha.

                    They're tougher than we are.
                    They'll piss you off from time to

                                 VALERIE
                    Thank you.
          
          He looks at her and sways slightly.
          
                              VALERIE
                    I don't care how angry you get. I
                    don't care what they say about us.
                    I don't care if you hate me. If
                    they take everything away from us,
                    but they are not going to take
                    this. They do not get to take my
                    marriage.
          
          Joe's eyes fill with tears.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    I'm so sorry.
          
          Tears fill her eyes.
          
                              VALERIE
                    You did good.
          
          He looks her in the eye. Shakes his head.
          
                              JOE WILSON
                    I did it for me.
          
          She shakes her head.
                                                                 111.

                    I know why you did it.
                        (She looks at him)
                    Thank you.
          
          There's a thousand things he could suddenly say. And suddenly
          nothing, as he fights tears.
          
                              JOE
                    If I could give it back to you. If
                    I could give you back who you were-
          
                              VALERIE
                    This is who I am. Right here.
          
          They clasp each other and hug, and all the pain drains away.
          They kiss. As they break she looks into her husband's eyes.
          
                              VALERIE
                    So are you ready to fight?
          
          Joe looks at his wife. His eyes filled with tears.

                    Arguably the most important speech
                    the president makes all year. Never

                      How did the question move from "Why
                      are we going to war?" to "Who is
                      that man's wife". I asked the first
                      question. Someone else asked the
                      second. It worked. Its still
                      working. Because we still don't
                      know the truth. But you all know my
                      wife's name.

                      their oath. That is yours. This

                      drafting session, he was stopped by
                      a woman on the street. She asked--

                      opportunity to set the record

                      my ability as a covert operations
                      officer for the Central
                      Intelligence Agency. I worked on
                      behalf of the national security of
                      our country, on behalf of the
                      people of the United States until
                      my name and true affiliation were
                      exposed in the national media on
                      July 14th, 2003, after a leak by
                      administration officials. Today I
                      can tell this committee even more.

                       In the run-up to the war with Iraq
                       I worked in the Counter
                       Proliferation Division of the CIA,
                       still as a covert officer whose
                       affiliation with the CIA was
                       classified. I raced to discover
                       solid intelligence for senior
                       policy makers on Iraq 's presumed
                       weapons of mass destruction
                       program. While I helped to manage
                       and run secret worldwide operations
                       against this WMD target from CIA
                       headquarters in Washington , I also
                       traveled to foreign countries on
                       secret missions to find vital
                       intelligence. I loved my career
                       because I love my country.
          
          BLACKOUT
          
          On March 6th 2007 Scooter Libby was found guilty of perjury,
          obstruction of justice and making false statements to the
          FBI, concerning the leaking of Valerie Plame's identity.
          
          He was handed the maximum sentence: two and a half years in
          prison, and a $250,000 fine.
          
          On July 2nd 2007. The President used his executive authority
          to commute the court's sentence.
          
          Joe and Valerie left Washington and found a new home in Santa
          Fe. They live there today, with their children.

               on scaffolding.  This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up
               of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously
               extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA.  His face

                         fast-food, strip-mall science --

                                   REED
                         This wasn't our first stop, in case
                         you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not
                         that bad.  He's just a little...
                             (seeing the statue)
                         Larger than life.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

               They move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium.

                                   REED
                         He's financed some of the biggest
                         breakthroughs of this century.

                                   BEN
                         You'd never know it.

               He motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's
               accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first
               private Space Station.

               All images have VICTOR front and center, glad-handling George
               Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders.  The last
               image is Victor holding the AMERICA'S CUP.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Jesus.  That too?

               They reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS.

                                   REED
                         Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see --

               A receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass.

                                   FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                         Executive elevator, top floor.

                                   BEN
                         What's the price for a smile round here?

               They head for the elevator.  Reed carries a small, black box. 
               As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO --

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY

               A large, dark office.  Ben in the corner.  He yawns,
               watches...

               BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars.  Planets.  They hover in the air,
               making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         My research suggests that exposure to
                         a high-energy cosmic storm born on
                         solar winds might have triggered the
                         evolution of early planetary life.

               REED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS
               FIGURE in shadow behind a desk.  An ominous, PULSATING RED
               CLOUD covers the stars.  It washes over a hologram of EARTH.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         In six weeks another cloud with the
                         same elemental profile will pass
                         Earth's orbit.  A study in space could
                         advance our knowledge about the
                         structure of the human genome, and
                         help cure countless diseases, extend
                         human life --

               The SHADOW clears his throat.  Reed speeds up, emotional.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Give kids the chance to be stronger,
                         healthier, less prone to --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Turn it off.  Please.

               The figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness.

                                   REED
                         But I haven't fully explained my --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Yes you have... Imagination.
                         Creativity.  Passion.  Those were
                         always your trademarks.

               Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR
               VON DOOM.  35, handsome, commanding.  He looks almost...
               airbrushed.  He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk.  REED is
               on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT
               CUTBACKS.              

                                   VICTOR
                         But dreams don't pay the bills, do
                         they?
                             (a condescending smile)
                         Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. 
                         Still reaching for the stars, with the
                         world on your back.

                                   REED
                         You remember in school we talked about
                         working together.  That's what I was
                         about to explain...

               Reed presses the remote.  Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE
               slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION.  Both bear the
               VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo.  Victor smiles, more intrigued.

                                   VICTOR
                         So it's not my money you want.  It's
                         my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't
                         trust you, why should I?

               Victor is a step ahead.  Reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  Ben
               wakes up, suspicious.  Victor notices.  He notices
               everything.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         That's my job.  To stay a step ahead. 
                         To know what other men don't.

               Ben gets close to Reed, turning toward the door.

                                   BEN
                         I can't take this.

                                   REED
                             (low, quiet)
                         Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
                         
               A beat.  Victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension.  And...

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         He's right, Ben.

               They turn to see...SUE STORM (demure, stunning) standing in a
               corner...possibly for the whole presentation.  A little cold:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         It's just business.

                                   VICTOR
                         I think you both know my Director of
                         Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

                                   BEN
                         Heya Susie.
                             (under breath, to Reed)
                         One more thing he's got.

               Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes
               off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, it's been too long.

               She gives Reed a polite handshake.  Victor watches carefully. 
               Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze.  A little tongue-tied.

                                   REED
                         You're, you've, I mean, how have you
                         bee--

                                   SUE
                         Never better.

               Victor sizes them up.  He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR
                         This isn't going to be a problem, is
                         it?

                                   REED
                         Not at all.

                                   SUE
                         Ancient history.

               Victor smiles, eyeing Sue.

                                   VICTOR
                         Good.  Then you're just in time to
                         hear the great Reed Richards ask me
                         for help.
                             (to Reed)
                         You know, you made a lot of folks at
                         MIT feel like a junior high science
                         fair.  So you'll excuse me if I savor
                         the moment.

               Ben tightens.  A hard beat.  Reed sucks it up.

                                   REED
                         You back this mission, and I'll sign
                         over a fair percentage of any
                         applications or --

                                   VICTOR
                         The number's seventy-five.  And it's
                         applications and patents.

                                   BEN
                         What about his first born?

                                   REED
                             (quiet)
                         Ben, the money's not important.  We
                         could save lives.

               Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.

                                   VICTOR
                         Twenty-five percent of a billion is
                         enough to keep the lights on, isn't
                         it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth
                         mortgage on the Baxter Building.

               They look at Victor.  How does he know all this...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Deal...?

               Reed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no.  But
               Reed...drops a nod.  Done.  Victor smiles, offers a
               handshake.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Well then, to our future.  Together.

               Victor squeezes.  Hard.  His other hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

                                   REED
                         Hilarious.

               As Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor.  Wary.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

               Director of Communications LEONARD enters, checking files.

                                   VICTOR
                         If Reed's right, then this little trip
                         will double our stock offering.

                                   LEONARD
                         And if he's not...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's always right.  Good thing he
                         doesn't always know what he's got...

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

               Reed and Ben step into the elevator.

                                   BEN
                         He knew about NASA.  What if he made
                         the call to shut us down --

                                   REED
                         Ben, think about all the people we can
                         help if this works --

                                   BEN
                         Maybe you should think about yourself
                         for once.  You always let this guy
                         push you round --

                                   REED
                         We got what we wanted.  That's
                         enough.

                                   BEN
                         I know, I know.  I'm just worried
                         about what he wants... Speaking of
                         which...

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to...SUE.  She joins them.  Doors
               shut.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

                                   SUE
                         You sure about this, Reed?

               He nods, head down.  He doesn't want eye contact.

                                   REED
                         Those solar winds are flaring, but I
                         factored them into my coordinates and --

                                   SUE
                         I was talking about us.  Working
                         together.

               Sue holds her eyes on Reed.  He is clearly uncomfortable in
               her gaze.  Did the elevator just get smaller?

                                   REED
                             (thinking, talking fast)
                         Well, uh, based on our history...you
                         can handle the biogenetics, and I'll
                         focus on the molecular physics.  Or,
                         uhm, maybe I should take the biotech,
                         you work the microscopes, since you
                         have some background in electropho--

                                   SUE
                             (droll, a little annoyed)
                         Right.  That's exactly what I meant.

               She shakes her head -- same old Reed.  He looks at her --
               what did he say wrong?  Ben smiles, patting Reed on the
               shoulder.

                                   BEN
                         Way to not overthink it.
                             (to Sue)
                         So when do we leave?

                                   SUE
                         I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in
                         the morning to talk about resources
                         and crew.

               She offers a business card.  Reed doesn't take it.

                                   REED
                         I, uh, think I remember the number.


                                   SUE
                         It's been changed.

               Beat.  Ben grimaces.  Reed takes the card, his eyes down.

                                   REED
                         As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could
                         pilot the mission --

                                   SUE
                         Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,
                         but we already have a pilot on our
                         payroll.  You remember my brother
                         Johnny...

               Off Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY

               A helicopter shot through trees.  We soar over timberland,
               and find something massive looming on the horizon:

               A SPACECRAFT.  A sleek take on a space shuttle.  Modern tech
               combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford. 
               The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. 
               WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred
               foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.

               EXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY

               Ben stares up at the craft.  A sneer on his face.

                                   BEN
                         Can't do it.  I cannot do it.

                                   REED
                         External SRBs, orbital system engines. 
                         Its just like the shuttles you flew
                         in --

                                   BEN
                         No.  I cannot take orders from that
                         underwear model.  That wingnut washed
                         out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria
                         Secret wannabes into a flight 
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         Youthful high spirits.

               They walk toward the base of the scaffolding.

                                   BEN
                         They crashed it into a wall.  A flight
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         I'm sure he's matured since then.

               CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. 
               PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's
               driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.  PICK UP
               Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         When have I asked you to do something
                         you absolutely said you could not do?

                                   BEN
                         Five times.

                                   REED
                         I had it at four.

                                   BEN
                         This makes five.

               INT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Reed and Ben unpack gear into lockers.  Suddenly --

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Captain on the bridge!

               Ben goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with
               a digital camera.  Then advances, as Ben realizes who it
               is...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick:
                         $59.  The look on your hard-ass former
                         CO's grill when he finds out he's your
                         junior officer: priceless.

               Ben eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. 
               Johnny flinches.  But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper,
               adjusts his uniform.

                                   BEN
                         I can handle the ship.  I can even
                         handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I
                         don't know if I should be flying or
                         playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the
                         hell came up with them?

                                   SUE
                         Victor did.

               Sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying
               a stack of flightsuits.  She hands them out to the guys.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         The synthetics act as a second skin,
                         adapting to your individual needs to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Keep the hot side hot, and the cool
                         side cool!

                                   REED
                         Wow.  Fantastic.

               Reed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit.  She wonders,
               maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Material made from self-regulating
                         unstable molecules.  I've been working
                         on a formula for this.

                                   SUE
                         Great minds think alike.

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         Guess some think faster than others.

               Victor enters, wearing his custom-tailored flightsuit.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         I hired Armani to design the pattern. 
                         These colors will look great on
                         camera.

               A DOOR OPENS.  Leonard enters, in a sharp suit.

                                   LEONARD
                         They're ready for you, sir.

                                   VICTOR
                         Showtime.

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - HALLS - NIGHT

               Leonard leads Victor through the halls.  Victor checks
               himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.

                                   LEONARD
                         Our numbers are through the roof.  The
                         IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a
                         share.  The bank's five times
                         oversubscribed --

                                   VICTOR
                         It's not just the money.  I could make
                         money in my sleep.

                                   LEONARD
                         Then what is it?

                                   VICTOR
                         History, Leonard.  History. 
                         Everything else is conversation...
                             (a beat)
                         How's the other matter?

               Leonard pulls out a BOX.  Opens it: a TEN KARAT DIAMOND RING.

                                   LEONARD
                         Harry Winston sends his regards.

               They hit a set of big doors.  Victor stops and looks into the
               reflective, metallic surface on the wall.  He fixes one last
               strand of hair.  Perfect. Then he opens the door to... 

               SNAP!SNAP!SNAP!  WHIP-PAN a row of CAMERAS snapping shots of --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - NIGHT

               Retrofitted into a makeshift press area.  Victor sits on a
               platform, with reporters stretched out below him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Today we stand on the edge of a new
                         frontier.  In the furthest depths of
                         outer space...we will find the secrets
                         to inner space.  The final key to
                         unlocking our genetic code lies in a
                         cosmic storm...

               BEHIND THE ACTION: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk past.  News
               crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture. 
               Our "Fantastic Four" are not exactly big news.  Not yet.

                                   BEN
                         Isn't that your speech?

                                   REED
                         He's made a few changes.

                                   BEN
                         This is your dream, Reed.  You should
                         be the one up there.

                                   REED
                         Victor's better at these things.

               Just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,
               waiting.  This is DEBBIE, Ben's fiancée.  And for the first
               time in the entire film...Ben SMILES.  They hug, kissing. 

               Johnny and Reed watch.  Reed glances at Sue, who walks ahead. 
               Debbie slips a photo into Ben's flightsuit.  A tender beat.

                                   BEN
                         I'll be watching over you.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Just get back soon, or I start looking
                         for a new groom.

               Ben looks at the little ENGAGEMENT RING on her finger.

                                   BEN
                         Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that
                         in for a bigger rock.

                                   DEBBIE
                         I don't care about rocks, I care about
                         you.
                             (to Reed)
                         You bring him back in one piece, or
                         you can forget being Best Man.

               Reed nods, smiles.  Debbie gives Ben a last kiss.  Ben turns
               to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile.

                                   BEN
                         What the hell you smiling at?  Just
                         keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
                         those SMBs --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Actually, the engines are SMEs.
                         Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. 
                         Couple generations past your last
                         ride.
                             (at the threshold)
                         I'm not as dumb as you look.

               Ben just glares at Reed.  This is going to be a long trip. 
               As they follow after Sue, we CUT BACK TO --

               VICTOR ON STAGE

               Mid-speech.  Playing behind him is REED'S HOLOGRAM: stars
               give way to a pulsating red cloud...

                                   VICTOR
                         Think of a world without genetic flaws
                         -- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
                         breast cancer...

               Ben and Reed hear the speech.  Ben bristles.

                                   BEN
                         What's wrong with being bald...?

               Victor smiles at the crowd, commanding.  A true leader.

                                   VICTOR
                         Darwin discovered evolution.  Now we --
                         I -- will define it.  Only in America
                         could...

               The red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the Earth.

                                   VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         ...a little country boy from Latveria
                         build one of the biggest companies in
                         the world, and truly reach the stars. 
                         Now if you'll excuse me, history
                         awaits...

               On those words, the HOLOGRAM TRANSFORMS TO...Von Doom's
               SHUTTLE on the launch pad.  BOOM!  THRUSTERS FIRE WHITE HOT. 
               Smoke billows across the pad.  Ready for take off.

               Victor walks past the hologram and exits.  His departure
               perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.

               We push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves
               Earth's atmosphere.  BOOM -- booster rockets fall away and
               the shuttle fires its thrusters.  The hologram transitions
               to...

               A shot of the SPACE STATION high above the Earth.  The
               shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with
               engines afire.  As the shuttle approaches the station we CUT
               TO --

               EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME

               THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above
               Earth.  THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME

               Victor and Sue lead the others into the command center.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (a "dad voice": to Ben)
                         If you behave, maybe next time
                         daddy'll let you drive.

                                   BEN
                         Keep talking, there won't be a next
                         time.

               Reed is focused on THE EARTH.

                                   SUE
                         Long way from the projection booth at
                         the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

               Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would
               bring that up.  It's the first time she's been nice to him so
               far.  He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with
               Sue.

                                   REED
                         Yes.  Yes it is.

               Johnny and Ben exchange a look.  Reed keeps looking at the
               stars, eyes wide, like a little kid.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               They enter the nerve center of the space station.  Victor
               goes to a computer console on the observation deck below. 
               The windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe.

                                   VICTOR
                             (to ground; via comm-link)
                         Leonard, how's the feed?

                                   LEONARD (V.O.)
                         Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

               Victor glances at a camera mounted into the console.

                                   SUE
                         We can monitor the cloud's approach
                         and observe the tests from here.

                                   BEN
                         Is it safe?

                                   REED
                         The shields on the station should
                         protect us.

                                   BEN
                         Should?

                                   VICTOR
                         What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million
                         dollars worth of equipment not enough
                         for you?

               Ben turns to Victor.  A little tension.  Reed cuts it:

                                   REED
                         Let's start loading those samples. 
                         Get your suit ready, Ben.

               Victor keeps his eyes on Ben.

                                   VICTOR
                         So you still do all the heavy lifting?

               Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Maybe you should have stayed back in
                         the lab.  Field work never suited you.

               Reed doesn't defend himself.  Ben steps up.

                                   BEN
                         He does the talking.  I do the
                         walking.  Got it?

               Victor holds tight to his smile.  He nods, condescending.

                                   VICTOR
                         Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm
                         going to borrow Susan for a second.

                                   REED
                         Sure.

               Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO --

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - LATER

               Ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots. 
               Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart,
               each containing a variety of plants.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me your dawg's not trying
                         to rekindle things with my sister.

                                   BEN
                         'Course not.  Strictly business.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

                                   BEN
                         Hey, two hearts got busted last time. 
                         Maybe she's not over it either.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the
                         year, more coin than God?  Or Reed,
                         the world's dumbest smart guy worth
                         less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's
                         a toss-up.

                                   BEN
                         Put your tiny little mind at ease.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Don't you wander off, boy.

               Johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.  He
               looks through a small window to see Ben give the thumbs up. 
               THE AIRLOCK DOOR opens, and Ben gracefully steps into space.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Sue descends the stairs at Victor's behest.  Joins him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

                                   SUE
                         I understand the business reasons.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, when you're looking at your
                         future, it never hurts to find closure
                         about the past.

               Sue's eyes narrow.  What is this about...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Susan, every man dreams that he'll
                         meet some woman he can give the world
                         to.

               He presses a button and the observation deck's outer windows
               open up, revealing a spectacular, romantic view of the EARTH.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

               While she stares out the window, Victor reaches into a
               pocket, revealing a RING BOX.  Sue looks unsettled.

               INT. SPACE STATION - NEARBY CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

               Reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall.  The
               results of his calculations are not what he expected... He
               sees WIND VELOCITY digits rise.  He does a double-take when
               he sees the readout: EVENT THRESHOLD, T-MINUS 10:00.

                                   REED
                         No...no...impossible.  It's...too
                         fast.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Behind his back, Victor holds the ring box in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         You've been with me two years now.

               Sue doesn't know where this is going.  She treads lightly.

                                   SUE
                         It's been a good two years, Victor...
                         The company's accomplished so much.

                                   VICTOR
                         Right, of course, the company... But
                         you see, I've come to realize all the
                         accomplishments in the world mean
                         nothing without someone to share them
                         with --

                                   SUE
                         Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done
                         something to make you think...

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of
                         taking big steps.  And this is the
                         biggest step yet.  If it helps, think
                         of this as a promotion.  A merger of
                         sorts...
                             (getting closer)
                         Four little words that can change our
                         lives...

               He is about to spring the ring on her.  She looks like a deer
               in headlights.  She opens her mouth, and...WHAM!  Doors slam
               open.  REED RUSHES INTO THE ROOM.

                                   REED
                         The cloud is accelerating!

               Victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I don't know what happened.

               Sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify Reed's
               claim.  Starts punching buttons.  Confirms Reed's findings
               with a nod.  Victor hardens, in control.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         We've got minutes until it hits, not
                         hours...Victor, that storm's deadly --
                         the radiation's lethal.  We need to
                         abort.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all
                         this way to lose our nerve at the
                         first little glitch.  Just close the
                         shields...

                                   REED
                         Ben's still out there --

                                   VICTOR
                         So reel him in.  But we came here to
                         do a job.  So let's do it.  Quickly.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

               Ben is carefully arranging SAMPLE BOXES OF PLANTS.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben, we need you back inside.

               Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         I ain't done arranging your flowers,
                         egghead.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around.

               Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him.  Ben
               turns and sees: THE COSMIC STORM, rumbling toward the
               station.  Not close, but not far.  That gets Ben's attention.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         Roger that, on my way.

               He turns back towards the ship.  BEHIND HIM, the storm grows.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME TIME

               Victor rushes into the room, looks at the monitors.  Sees the
               others near the airlock on one screen, and the approaching
               cloud on another.  Anxiety creeps across his face.

                                   AUTOMATED VOICE
                         Event threshold in two minutes.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               Reed and Johnny stand by the airlock, waiting for Ben.  They
               heard the automated voice.  It panics Reed.

                                   REED
                         Come on, Ben, come on...

                                   VICTOR (ON RADIO)
                         Reed, we're running out of time.

               EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

               A wake of turbulence from the cloud hits Ben, making it
               harder to maneuver.  The cloud's tendrils snake toward him.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               They can see Ben outside the window, still twenty yards away. 
               The entire corridor rumbles.  Lights flicker and spark.  They
               watch helplessly.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               Sue watches the monitor, also helpless.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny... Reed...

               Victor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to
               Sue.  Practically shoves her aside as he hits the INTERCOM.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed, you need to get up here so we
                         can close the shields!  Now!

               Sue glares at Victor.  His lack of compassion shocks her.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Not until Ben is back inside!

                                   VICTOR
                         It's too late for him, and soon it'll
                         be too late for all of us.

               Victor doesn't bother to wait for a response.  He takes over
               the console, punching keys.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing?

                                   VICTOR
                         Raising the shields.

                                   SUE
                         You can't leave them out there.

               Sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.

                                   VICTOR
                         Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You
                         can't help them any more than I can.

               Beat.  She takes a step toward the door.  Not sure what to
               do.

                                   SUE
                         I can try.

               With one final glare, she bolts from the room.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               Reed bites his lip.  Thinks.  He decides.

                                   REED
                         Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the
                         command center.  Close the shields.
                         
                                   JOHNNY
                         What about you?

               One look from Reed tells Johnny, he won't leave without Ben. 
               Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage.  He's not going either.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (to Ben)
                         Come on big guy, you can do it!

               INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Victor watches the shields slide down.  Alone.  An island.

                                   AUTOMATED VOICE
                         Event threshold in thirty seconds.

               Sue races down the hall.  Not panicked.  With determination.

               EXT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY

               The exterior air lock door slides open.  In agonizing,
               weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside. 

               The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a
               hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange
               stains.  Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.  Ben
               hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.

               Johnny punches controls to close the exterior airlock door...

               Reed opens a first aid kit, grabs a thermo-elastic blanket...

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               Clutching the diamond ring, Victor stands defiantly.  Showing
               absolutely no concern for the others.  Interested only in the
               event itself.  Lights and equipment FALL, CRASHING around
               him.

               A control panel EXPLODES in Victor's face.  He jumps back,
               and into the falling equipment.  Collapses under the weight.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - SAME TIME

               Sue rounds a corner, sees Reed and Johnny.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny!  Reed!

                                   AUTOMATED VOICE
                         FIVE...FOOOOUUUR...

               SLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as:

               -- JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel.
               -- REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door.
               -- VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket.
               -- THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin.

               SLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a
               SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben
               in the back, ripping through his suit.  The exterior door
               shuts and seals.  The station loses all power.  DARKNESS.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - DAY

               As quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away,
               leaving the space station intact.  Power quietly flickers on. 

               Silence.  Time resumes.  All four pick up exactly where they
               left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them.

               INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Victor emerges from the rubble.  He stands, checks his body. 
               A few scrapes, nothing serious.  A thin, throbbing CUT on his
               head.  He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding.

               INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY

               Reed and Johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door. 
               Sue joins them, as they pull Ben in.  They try to remove his
               helmet.  We don't see his face, but he's clearly unconscious.

                                   REED
                         He's not responsive --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Ben!  Ben!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               A BLACK SCREEN:

                                   JOHNNY'S VOICE
                         Ben, wake up!  Wake up!

               SUBJECTIVE CAMERA, BEN'S POV: The blurry image of Johnny
               comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Where...where am I?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Back on Earth.  Victor's medical
                         facility... We're in quarantine.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Reed? ... Sue?

                                   JOHNNY
                         They're fine.  Everybody else...is
                         fine.

               Johnny looks away, as if he can't bear to lay eyes on him.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         What's wrong with me?

                                   JOHNNY
                         I swear to you they've done everything
                         humanly possible.  The best plastic
                         surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had
                         the best --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Give me a mirror...

               Johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before Ben can
               reach it, reluctant to give it to him.

                                   JOHNNY
                         They said that's not such a good idea,
                         the shock alone could --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Give me the god damn mirror!

               Ben grabs it from him.  Then slowly raises it to look and see
               that...except for some serious stubble, Ben's totally normal.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Unfortunately, the doctors just
                         couldn't do anything to fix your face!

               He cackles as he heads for the door.  Ben heaves the mirror
               at him, breaking it into hundreds of pieces.  He turns to the
               side-table, and grabs that picture of DEBBIE.  It calms him.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING - DAY

               A modern facility of glass and stone, nestled in the forest. 
               In stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Reed walks down the hall.  His hair is GRAYING at the
               temples.  He passes Johnny, who is smiling, still enjoying
               his joke on Ben.  Johnny slows, looking at Reed's hair.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice 'do.  Going for the "grandpa"
                         look?

               Reed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs.  He
               keeps going.  He passes a partially open door.  He stops when
               he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed.  He sees a vase of
               flowers.  He grabs a couple lilies, and enters.

               But Reed sees...the room is already FILLED with expensive
               flowers.  All from VICTOR.  Reed is trumped once again.

               A DOCTOR writes on Sue's chart.  A wall TV plays a press
               conference with Victor, outside the FACILITY.  He looks worse
               for wear.  A few hairs out of place, and a small BANDAGE on
               his face.  We PUSH INTO the press conference --

               Victor pauses.  For the first time.  Just a flicker.

                         then you're all cleared. 

               The Doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out.  Reed steps to
               Sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand.  Quiet:

                                   REED
                         Sue...I want to tell you...I'm...

               WHOOSH.  A NURSE rolls in with a tray bearing ten more
               extravagant bouquets.  Reed looks resigned.  He walks out.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         She's allergic to orchids.  Put that
                         Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The
                         African lilies?  They're her
                         favorites.

               Reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash. 

               Sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               A SEXY NURSE wheels a testing station into Johnny's room. 
               He's stripped down to Calvins, changing into a ski outfit.

                         Finish the tests, I know -- could you
                         give me a hand with this zipper?

                                   NURSE
                         You know this is not a ski resort.

                         Not yet.

               Johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful
               fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  In the blink of
               an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD.

                         packages.

               The nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up.

                         You are trouble.

               They both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital
               read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast.

                         That'll give you a minute to freshen
                         up.

               He hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the
               door.  The machine beeps: Johnny's temperature is 209
               DEGREES.

                         How long was I out?

                         Three days.  I was worried about you.

                                   BEN
                         Solid.

               Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         How you doing?

               Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.

                         I don't know.  I just keep going over
                         and over the numbers.

               Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.

                                   BEN
                         It was a freak of nature.  Last I

                         ball.  Let it go.

               Reed considers.  But he can't let it go.  He opens his
               computer back up, returning to work.  Ben shakes his head,
               looks out at the view.  His eyes catch on something, wheels
               turning.

                                   REED
                         Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --

                                   BEN
                         Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE.

                                   REED
                         What?  Come on.  She's got a good
                         thing with Victor --

                                   BEN
                         I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen
                         your screws?

                                   REED
                         He's smart, powerful, successful --

                                   BEN
                         Well maybe you should date him.

               Reed looks at Ben, resigned.

                                   REED
                         Ben.  He'll give her the life she
                         deserves.  She ended up with the right
                         guy.  Things worked out for the best.

               Reed steps away.  Ben stands alone, an idea sparking.

                                   BEN
                         Do I have to do everything myself?

               INT. HELICOPTER/EXT. MOUNTAIN SUMMIT - DAY

               The chopper hovers over this pristine peak.  JOHNNY and his
               NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear. 
               Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.

               His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out. 
               Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation.  They
               look down at a death-defying black diamond run.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Me like-y.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Stay right.  Left is trouble.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I though we went over this.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Last one down springs for room
                         service.

               She pulls down her goggles, jumps out.  Johnny drops out
               after her, hitting the snow.  He smolders: literally.  The
               snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.

               He takes off after her and the chase is on:

               EXT. BLACK DIAMOND RUN - DAY

               The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in
               and out of the trees through deep powder.  Johnny's a speed
               freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them. 

               Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire,
               flies off.  Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.

               The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even. 
               She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         You're on fire!

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not this again --

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         No: You're ON FIRE!

               Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm. 
               His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire. 
               A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.

               Nurse loses concentration, falls.  Johnny races away like a
               missile, screaming in exhilaration.  He looks back -- no
               nurse.

               He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally
               VEERS to the LEFT.  He fails to notice the giant CHASM in
               front of him.  He faces forward and...

               SCREEAAMMS!  LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying
               to catch ground.  FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS
               towards the rocks below.  He tries to will his body away. 

               Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame.  He is a HUMAN
               TORCH!  And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving
               him some kind of...LIFT.  He maneuvers just over the rocks,
               almost making a 90 degree turn.

               He looks back at the rocks in disbelief.  But the lift
               doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a
               snowbank.

               He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't.  He's trapped
               under snow and ice.  With all his strength, he tries to move,
               NO DICE.  Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around
               quickly begins to melt.  Johnny is on fire, and within
               seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the
               water.

               The nurse races toward the steam.  Scared, panicked.  She
               finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot
               tub, staring at his hands.  His body.  Exhilarated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Care to join me?

               She smiles and unzips.  The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               On an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, Victor
               prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about. 
               He checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.

                                   VICTOR
                         How's the IPO?

                                   LEONARD
                         Stable.  We're looking at low
                         twenties.  It's a good number,
                         considering the fallout from --

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's disaster.  You know, I half-
                         think he did this to me on purpose.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

               But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,
                         cover of the Journal...
                             (staring into silver tray)
                         I've got to do something about this
                         scar.  Make sure they only shoot my
                         right side.

                                   LEONARD
                         Actually, uh, people seem to think the
                         scar "humanizes" you.

                                   VICTOR
                         And that's a good thing?

               Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.  It
               glistens in the silver tray.  His eyes are bloodshot,
               sleepless.

                                   LEONARD
                         You know, maybe you should get some
                         rest --

                                   VICTOR
                         Later.  First, I've got some
                         unfinished business.  A deal that
                         needs closing...

               Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread.  A beat.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? 
                         You could have any woman in the world
                         but --

                                   VICTOR
                         That's why.  Because I could have
                         any other woman... You know, when
                         they asked Caesar "why England," he
                         said, "because it's not mine."

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

               Two dozen EMPLOYEES sit and eat.  Others serve themselves at
               the buffet.  Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall --

                                   SUE
                         I can only stay for one drink, Ben. 
                         I've got to meet with Victor.

                                   BEN
                         Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

               They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Hey Reed, what are you doing here?
                             (before he can answer)
                         Great, why don't you join us?

               He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. 
               Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the
                         buffet.

               Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING

               The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The
               room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp
               on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.

                                   BEN
                         Pardon me...

               Sue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again.

                                   REED
                         Are you alright?

                                   BEN
                         I think I need to lie down.  Bad
                         shrimp.

               This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,
               unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Really bad shrimp.

               ANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat. 
               A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this
               woman.

                                   REED
                         Feeling better?

                                   SUE
                         Yes, thanks.

                                   REED
                         That's good.  That's uh...good.

                                   SUE
                         You always had a way with words.
                             (an awkward beat)
                         I should be getting back.

               Sue gets up to leave.  Exasperated, Reed tries to think of
               something, anything, to say.

                                   REED
                         I'm really happy for you and Victor.

               She slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more.

                                   SUE
                         You're happy for me and Victor.

                                   REED
                         I can tell you guys are enjoying what
                         was the best part of our relationship --

                                   SUE
                         Which was?

                                   REED
                         Passion.

               We see surprise on Sue's face, and...

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         For science.

                                   SUE
                             (frustrated)
                         You are such a dork, Reed... You never
                         got it and never will unless it's
                         explained to you in quantum physics.

               As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around
               her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.

                                   REED
                         What?  What did I say?

               She looks more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         It's never what you say.  It's what
                         you don't say. What you don't do...

               She lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt --
               she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.

                                   REED
                         I...I...I just wanted to --

               As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.

                                   SUE
                         It's been two years, and all you can
                         say is you're happy for me and some
                         other guy...
                             (standing up, hurt)
                         You know, Victor may be a lot of
                         things, but at least he's not afraid
                         to fight for what he wants...
                             (Reed looks down)
                         And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. 
                         To be heard...seen... Reed, look at
                         me.

               He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her
               cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue...?  I can't.

                                   SUE
                         What?  What do you mean you --

                                   REED
                         Sue...look at your hands.

               She raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a
               medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her
               clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.

               Sue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a
               GLASS off the table...

               SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed
               instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two
               feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- 

               Then snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in
               disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue
               reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         You guys will not believe what just
                         happened!

               They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for
               the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               CLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides
               out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair
               to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He
               PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR. 

               It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor
               peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. 
               Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING

               DOUBLE DOORS burst open.  Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently
               walk.

                                   SUE
                         It has to be the cloud.  It's
                         fundamentally altered our DNA.

                                   REED
                         Let's not jump to conclusions, we need
                         a massive amount of evidence before
                         making that leap.

               Reed glances over his shoulder.  He stares.  Sue follows his
               gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire.  He SNAPS his
               fingers.  They GO OUT.  He's totally unharmed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Now what is up with that?

                                   REED
                             (deadpan)
                         The cloud has fundamentally altered
                         our DNA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?

                                   SUE
                         Apparently I can disappear.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me you go silent too. 

               Only one thing on Reed's mind --

                                   REED
                         We have to find Ben.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive
               bursts of flame.  He turns it on and off, like the "CLAPPER."

                                   JOHNNY
                         Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame
                         off --

                                   SUE
                         Johnny.

               He does it again.  Flame on, flame off.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Stop it.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay, "mom."

               Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the
               banging, moaning and pleading inside.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my
                         nurse!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Ben, are you there?

               A creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and
               gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the
               contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough
               and craggy.  SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         Open up Ben, we need to talk.

               It all stops.  A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way
               and it crashes to the floor.  Under the covers, he groans in
               pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:

                                   BEN
                         LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed decides they can't wait any longer.  He kneels to the
               floor.  He concentrates, not sure if it will work...
               Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE
               DOORJAMB.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed's arm wriggles under the door.  It bends upward, swiping
               clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob.  Rubbery fingers
               find the latch and unlock the door.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed focuses, and pulls.  His arm snakes out from under the
               door and snaps back into place.  His flesh and bones
               reforming before their eyes.  Johnny stares at Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting.

               They hear a tremendous SMASH from inside the room.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               They open the door.  The room is trashed.  Every stick of
               furniture smashed to splinters.

                                   REED
                         ...Ben?

               Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used
               to be.  They rush to it.  Looking out they see SOMETHING
               LARGE in the distance, running away.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What is that thing?

                                   SUE
                         I think that thing is Ben.

               Reed looks out, emotions roiling.  Is that his best
               friend...?  Suddenly, Victor comes around the corner (bandage
               bigger).

                                   VICTOR
                         What's going on?

                                   SUE
                         Victor, are you feeling alright?

               He considers, but never shows weakness.  He nods.

                                   VICTOR
                         Just a little banged up.  A couple
                         scrapes.  Why?

                                   REED
                         Ben did this.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben did this?

                                   REED
                         He's had some kind of...reaction to
                         exposure from the cloud.  And he's not
                         the only one.

                                   SUE
                         We need to find him.

               Victor redirects his attention to Sue.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Victor, I'm sorry I --

                                   VICTOR
                             (cold)
                         Just find him.

               Victor strides off, leaving the others.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Anybody know where the big guy's
                         going?

               We PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed
               knows exactly where Ben is going.

                                   REED
                         He's going home.

               EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

               A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. 
               CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo
               trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where...

               A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide
               open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or
               someTHING barrels into the night.

               EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking
               glass.

               INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip,
               shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large.

               EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben.

               CLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but
               they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more
               and more frustrated.  He manages to press "0" with his pinky.

                                   BEN
                         Hello, Operator?

               Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a
               modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees
               Debbie grab the phone.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Deb... It's me.  I need you to step
                         out front.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Out front?  You home, baby?  I got
                         a surprise for you.

               He blinks hard.  Sad, dark.

                                   BEN
                         I got a surprise for you too.

               EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT

               Debbie steps out.  There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the
               door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something
               shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Ben?

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Don't come any closer for a sec.  This
                         is gonna be kind of a shock... You
                         remember when we said "together
                         forever no matter what"?

                                   DEBBIE
                         Baby, you're scaring me.

               A hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE
               HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he
               once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.

               Debbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to
               think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to
                         Ben?

                                   BEN
                         Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

               He reaches out.  She recoils.  It's too much for her.  Tears
               swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away.

               He takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over
               her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a
               halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!

               Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he
               has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time
               he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist.

                                   BEN
                         I love you, Deb.

               With that, he turns away.  The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters,
               falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on
               around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.

               INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY

               Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: "VDM" emblazoned
               on a gold plate.  Leonard waits not-so-patiently.

                                   VICTOR
                         Make sure you find Ben, bring him back
                         here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't
                         need this to hit the press.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at
                         eight, then a nine-thirty interview
                         with the Journal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Front page?

                                   LEONARD
                         Top left, like you asked.
                             (a smile)
                         Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who
                         knows...maybe Washington.

               Victor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Leonard.  Think bigger.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               We swoop toward this epic monument.  On a steel girder above
               the road, we see...a STATUE.  BEN.  He sits on the edge of
               the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,
               muttering.

                                   BEN
                         A few days in space, it'll be great,
                         what's the worst that could happen?

               A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on
               his shoulder.  Ben just glares up at the heavens.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Perfect.  Thanks.

               He hears the sound of someone SOBBING.  He turns to see...a
               distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase.  The man drops his
               case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.

               The Businessman looks out, ready to jump.  He doesn't see Ben
               (or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You think you got trouble?  Take a
                         good look, pal, how bad could it be?

               The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.  Ben steps forward.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, easy there, buddy.

               Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY!  His
               arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight
               while his legs thrash over speeding traffic.  Cars and trucks
               SKIM right underfoot.  Ben shakes his head.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You had to choose my spot, didn't you?

               Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam!  The
               Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP!  He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing
               hard on the highway!  A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben.  They point. 

               Ben looks up, deer in headlights.  He sees a massive TRUCK
               bearing down on the Businessman.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         This is really not my day.

               Ben DROPS to the street.  WHOOMPF!  He lands in front of the
               Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and
               turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.

               The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide.  The truck SWERVES,
               but cannot stop!  Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little
               scared.  He shuts his eyes, and...

               SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK!  A football move.  The
               truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to
               the windshield!  It looks like a metal car-compactor.

               The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders. 
               CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A
               FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT!  Windows shatter, fires flicker. 
               One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER.  COPS clamber out.

               EXT. CAB ON HIGHWAY - DAY

               Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back.  They see the action
               on the bridge.  Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the
               destruction.  He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped
               in his cab.  Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.

               He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the
               airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon.  He tries to grab
               the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG.  He struggles.

                                   BEN
                         A little help here?!  You wanna hit
                         that button, sir?

               The driver is too woozy.  Ben can't get to the button. 
               Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE
               DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab!  COPS round the corner. 
               They see Ben holding onto the Driver.  They raise their guns.

                                   COP
                         FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
                         DOWN!

               Ben looks at the cops.  PEDESTRIANS stare, point.  He
               realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man
               in hand.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - APPROACH - DAY

               At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops.  The
               whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  We PUSH
               TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...

               REED, JOHNNY, SUE.  They look through smoke and mayhem to
               see...their first full look at Ben.  Reed stands gutpunched.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not even Ben deserves that.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it.  He lunges
               behind a truck.  The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them
               back.  Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.

               He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on
               walkways overhead.  He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING
               MOTORISTS.  He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - GRIDLOCK - DAY

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames.  All other
               people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  BRIDGE POLICE herd
               the crowd away from the accident.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Back!  We're evac-ing the bridge. 

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny slow down, swap glances.

                                   SUE
                         What now?  Reed...?  What do we do?

               MOVE IN ON REED.  A first test of leadership.  But he is not
               a leader.  Not yet.  Sue gets closer to him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Ben's out there.  Let's go get him.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Maybe you didn't hear me.  Those cars
                         are gonna blow sky high, any second.

                                   REED
                         Look, we've got a friend out there in
                         trouble.  We need to get to him before --

                                   BRIDGE COP #2
                         Nobody gets past this point.

               A hard beat.  Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod.

                                   SUE
                         What?

                                   REED
                             (mutters)
                         We need to get past them.

               He motions to her body.  She understands.  She concentrates,
               and starts to turn invisible.

                                   BRIDGE COP #1
                         What the hell is this?  A magic show?

               But her clothes don't go invisible.  Beat.  Reed mutters:

                                   REED
                         Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.

                                   SUE
                         What...?
                             (realizes)
                         Oh.

               She unbuttons her blouse.  Not thrilled with the idea.  She
               wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She
               reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses
               concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her
               undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned. 

               The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of
               bricks.  Cops are transfixed.  So is Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         This is wrong in so many ways.

                                   REED
                         You've been working out.

                                   SUE
                         Shut up.

               Sue takes a deep breath.  Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing
               happens.  She's embarrassed and furious.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you
                         should strip down next, see how it
                         feels to have fifty people staring --

               ...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.  Undies float.  Jaws drop.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue?

               She stops ranting.  Realizes she's gone invisible.

                                   SUE (INVISIBLE)
                         Oh.  Well then...

               The undies drop.  The cops stare open-mouthed.  They turn to
               look at Reed, astonished.  He sheepishly shrugs his
               shoulders.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm gonna need serious therapy.

               A beat.  She walks away.  The cops watch her, gaping.  By the
               time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone,
               disappearing into the clouds of smoke.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best
               angle on the action.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY

               Reed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big
               TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!

               He finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO! 
               His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps.

                                   BEN
                         What the --!

                                   REED
                         Ben.  Are you okay?

                                   BEN
                         Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?! 

               He motions to Reed's neck.  Then to his own body:

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause
                         I sure ain't Ben anymore.

               Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT!

               Ben spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does
               see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!

               BOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty
               cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! 

               Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms
               FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.

               FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. 
               Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving
               him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,
               SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks
               the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.

               Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The
               air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.

               She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields
               SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames
               hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from
               her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... 

               Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE
               FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast
               deflects off the street and into...

               An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF
               THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail
               slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.

               THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE
               WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck
               TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the
               front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!

               He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across
               the concrete, digging grooves into the street.

               ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward
               the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down
               at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The
               HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!

               Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! 
               His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. 
               Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic,
               painful.

               He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. 
               His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the
               truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing
               over Ben.

               Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps
               back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary
               cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...

               The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers
               joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,
               touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. 

               Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;
               he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE.  Ben steps
               toward her, but she stops him with a look.  She places
               something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.

               Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground.  He stoops over
               to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING.  His big fingers can't grip
               it.  He tries in vain.  Hopeless, pathetic.  A beat.  And... 

               A hand grabs the ring.  It's Reed.  Quiet, close.

                                   REED
                         I swear to you, I will do everything
                         in my power until there is not a
                         breath left in me: you are going to be
                         Ben again.

               Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma TV. 
               ON THE TV: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new
               Fantastic Four.  For the first time they strike a heroic
               pose.  Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.

                                   LEONARD
                         Uh, sir...Larry King called, to
                         cancel.
                             (seeing the TV, a beat)
                         Apparently, there's a bigger story.

               Victor sees Reed put his arms around Sue as he covers her
               with the jacket. And the penny drops: he's FURIOUS.  As it
               hits him, he feels something odd.  He looks down at his
               hand...at glints of gleaming METAL poking through flesh.

               EXT./INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - DAY

               An impromptu command center -- a series of police tents,
               surrounded by EMERGENCY VEHICLES, NEWS VANS, FIRETRUCKS.

               INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - TENT - DAY

               Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny sit together, getting changed. 
               They get ready to go, but the CHIEF FIREMAN enters, stopping
               them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         There's some folks outside, want to
                         talk to you.

                                   REED
                         We're not going public with this. 
                         We're scientists, not celebrities.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         Too late, son.

               He turns on a little TV MONITOR in the corner.  NEWS FOOTAGE
               plays on all stations, with the tagline: FANTASTIC FOUR.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         That's what they're calling you.  The
                         Fantastic Four.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice.

               Johnny heads for the exit.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Let's think this
                         through, a second.

               Johnny pauses.  Rubs his chin once.  And...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay.  Done thinking.

               He runs out.  Sue, Ben, and Reed swap glances, knowing Johnny
               cannot be their spokesman.  They take off after him, out to --

               EXT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - PRESS FIELD - DAY

               CLICKCLICKCLICK!  Fifty cameras flash.  The field is full of
               press.  Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.

               Johnny eats up the attention.  Ben turns, self-conscious. 
               Reed notices.  The Chief Fireman turns to them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         So which one of you's the leader?

               Johnny does not hesitate.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That'd be me.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         No seriously.

               A beat.  Sue and Ben turn to Reed.  The Chief hands him a
               mic.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         You're on, son.  They all want a
                         statement.

               All eyes go on Reed.  He looks out, gulps hard.  A long beat.

                                   REED
                         Uh, during our recent mission to the
                         Von Doom space station, we were
                         exposed to as yet-unidentified
                         radioactive energy, most likely some
                         kind of nucleotide compoun--

               Nobody came for a science class.  A crush of questions
               overwhelms Reed:

                                   VARIOUS REPORTERS
                         What happened on the bridge?  Does it
                         hurt to stretch?  Were you really on
                         fire?  Is it true that one of you can
                         fly?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Working on it.  And it's a lot harder --

                                   SUE
                         We don't know much more than you do,
                         at this point.  Which is why we will
                         be going directly to the lab, where we
                         can diagnose our symptoms and --

                                   REPORTER #2
                         Symptoms?  So it's like a disease?

               Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt.  Ben is lost in
               thought, looking at Deb's ENGAGEMENT RING.  Johnny leaps in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Symptoms?  Please.  If having powers
                         is a disease, then yeah we got it. 
                         And we are gonna blow your minds. 
                         There's a new day dawning.  The day of
                         the Fantastic Four.

                                   REPORTER #3
                         That thing doesn't look too fantastic.

               The Reporter nods toward Ben.  Ben's fists tighten, the sound
               of rocks crushing together.  Reed feels the pain.

                                   REED
                         Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero
                         who's been through a terrible orde--

                                   JOHNNY
                         What he's trying to say is: every team
                         needs a mascot...

               Reporters laugh.  Ben turns his head away.  Reed burns.

                                   REED
                         Look, we went up to space to find a
                         way to understand DNA, to cure
                         disease, save lives.  Well, now it's
                         our DNA, our disease, our lives on the
                         line...
                             (a beat)
                         Thank you.  No more questions.

               Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.  The press waits a beat,
               then surges.  Ben spins, holding up one finger.  A giant.

                                   BEN
                         Be nice.

               The press step back, intimidated.  Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's
               FACE FREEZES.  It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in --

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               Establishing shot of a historic New York building.

               INT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               BANKERS sit around a table.  LAPTOPS hum.  The lead banker is
               power-broker NED CECIL.  The men keep their eyes on Victor.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Well, Victor, the bank would like to
                         congratulate you.  On the fastest
                         freefall since the Depression.  We
                         can't even give your stock away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ned, you know I can turn this around.

               Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You promised a cure-all, and came back
                         with this.  Who the hell's going to
                         invest in a biotech company that turns
                         its workers into circus freaks?

               Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS
               FLICKER, losing feeds.

               Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do
               that?)  He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.

                                   VICTOR
                             (pointed)
                         I really appreciate all your support.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You've got a week, Victor.  One week
                         to turn this around.  Or we pull
                         out...
                             (a beat)
                         This meeting is over.

               Victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we CUT HARD TO --

               INT. BANK - HALLWAY - DAY

               Victor and Leonard stride out.  Victor is writhing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know
                         preferred stock from livestock.

               Leonard is thinking all business.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir.  Reed's comments at that press
                         conference killed us.  How are we
                         going to turn this around?

               Victor considers.  His mind races, eyes narrow.

                                   VICTOR
                         Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can
                         cure these freaks, then I can cure
                         anyone.  What better way to restore my
                         reputation?

               Leonard nods, impressed.  Victor is a man in motion.  As they
               step into sunlight, we cut to...CLICKCLICKCLICK in --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               REPORTERS snap pictures.  A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping
               in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny and
               get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON,
               which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle
               position.

               COPS hold back the surging press.  Ben keeps his head down,
               self-conscious.  He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Smile, Ben.  They want to like you. 
                         Give 'em your good side.  Or your less
                         bad side.

               Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.  Stiff, tentative:

                                   BEN
                         Uh...don't do drugs.

               The kids FLINCH.  Ben trudges on.  Johnny smiles bright,
               doing hand-signs for F4.  Sue pulls him toward --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

               The Fantastic Four enter.  They are greeted by JIMMY
               O'HOOLIHAN, an old-time doorman with a kind smile.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr.
                         Richards.  All that for you?

               He motions to the flashing cameras outside.

                                   REED
                         I'm afraid so...

               He searches for the name.  Sue steps up.

                                   SUE
                         Jimmy.  Good to see you again.

               He smiles at Sue, then at Reed.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Good to see you too... Don't worry,
                         sir.  I know how crowded that head of
                         yours is.

                                   REED
                         Any visitors while I was away?

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Just the usual.  Told 'em you were
                         circling round outer space.

               He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK.  Reed looks
               sheepish.  He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue.

                                   REED
                         We had a tough year.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, nine years straight.

               Reed looks at Ben.  Thanks a lot.  DING.  Elevator doors
               open.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               They enter.  Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Twenty?  From outside the place looks
                         a lot taller.

                                   REED
                         Oh, it is.

               The doors close, but...the ELEVATOR does not move.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Either we're moving really fast...or
                         not at all.

               A digital readout on the panel: EXCEED MAXIMUM WEIGHT.  A
               sign reads: MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 2000 pounds.  They turn to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         I'll take the stairs.

               Doors open.  He lumbers out.  As the doors close behind him,
               he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The elevator rises.  Reed roils with guilt.

                                   SUE
                         How come Ben can't turn it on and off
                         like us?

                                   REED
                         That's what we're here to find out.

                                   SUE
                         If it happened to him, then it
                         could...

               Happen to all of them.  Reed nods softly.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Wait.  You mean there's chance we
                         could be full-on-24-7-fantastic? 

                                   SUE
                         Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run
                         around on fire for the rest of your
                         life?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I
                         can't be the only one who thinks
                         this is cool.

               Reed considers.  But Sue cuts him short with a look.

               DING!  The elevator stops.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

               The elevator opens.  They step out.  They might be on the
               20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor
               sixty.  It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above -- 

               Reed leads them into another area filled with separate
               "apartments" and all the amenities of home.

                                   REED
                         We should stay here until we can
                         define the extent of our changes...

                                   JOHNNY
                         This place is deluxe.  You got cable?

                                   REED
                             (hearing Ben's FOOTSTEPS)
                         ...and figure out how to reverse them. 
                         Let me show you to your rooms.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               The press has died down, but there are still plenty of
               cameras.  A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up.  Victor emerges, wearing
               sunglasses.  This time, the press pay no attention to him. 
               No cameras flash.  Victor tightens, and enters the building.

               INT. SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair. 
               She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a SCRAPBOOK.

               She flips through it.  It's filled with pictures of Reed and
               his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia
               globe.  She stops at a picture of her and Reed in COLLEGE.

               A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to
               see...VICTOR.  He smiles, standing at the door, watching her.

                                   VICTOR
                         God, I've been so worried about you.

               She notices the scar on his head.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, your scar --

                                   VICTOR
                         I told you, I'm fine.  It's you I'm
                         worried about.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --

                                   VICTOR
                         Please, no apologies.  I've arranged
                         for your things to be moved to one of
                         my condos.  You'll have round-the
                         clock care.

               He goes for her bag.  But she stops him.  A half beat.

                                   SUE
                         Thank you, that's generous, but I
                         think I should stay here.  With my
                         brother.  Until we get a handle on
                         this.

               Victor is not used to being rebuffed.  He gives a thin smile.

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue.  I think you should let my
                         doctors have a look at you.

               A tense beat.  Standoff.  Made more tense by --

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Victor!  What are you doing here?

               They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm starting to wonder the same
                         thing... How much do you know about
                         what happened to you?

                                   REED
                         Not much.  We need to run tests to see
                         the extent of the damage.

               Victor pauses.  He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, let me know if there is anything
                         I can do.  We're all in this together
                         now.

               Victor shakes Reed's hand.  His GRIP is so tight that Reed's
               fingers STRETCH.  Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts
               her hand out.  He smiles, and shakes.  He heads off.

               Reed looks at his hand.  Shakes his wrist.  He looks at
               Victor.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY

               Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  Reed catches
               up.

                                   REED
                         Victor wait... I just wanted to say,
                         I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
                         planned --

               Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR
                         Didn't go as planned?  It was a
                         catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of
                         four people --

                                   REED
                         I ruined?  With all due respect, I
                         told you to abort --

                                   VICTOR
                         Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my
                         name, billions of dollars on the line,
                         and I will not let you make me look
                         like a fool --

                                   REED
                         Victor, if we could understand what
                         happened to us --

                                   VICTOR
                         I don't want to understand it.  This
                         isn't one of your science projects.  I
                         just want to fix it.  Fast!

               Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing.  Lights dim.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         There a problem, Vic?

               They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway. 
               Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body.

                                   VICTOR
                         No problem, Ben.

               He turns back to Reed.  Close, quiet.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Just pay your goddamn electric bill,
                         and get to work on a cure.

               Victor steps away, toward the elevator.  He passes Ben, who
               just smiles and waves "goodbye."  Before Victor's finger taps
               the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit
               responded to him).  Reed exhales, shaken.  Victor steps into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE.  He SLAMS his
               fist into a STEEL WALL.  The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING.

               Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC
               SHELL under the skin.  He stares at it in horror.  The dark
               surface pulsates with electric energy.  What is he
               becoming...?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               Sue works the controls.  Reed approaches Ben with an
               ELECTRODE NEEDLE.  He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but
               it SNAPS.

                                   BEN
                         You got a chisel round here?

                                   REED
                         If we're going to identify the source
                         of the mutation, we need to isolate
                         your recombinant DNA so we can
                         activate positional genomes.

               Ben looks to Sue for translation.

                                   SUE
                         We need to give you a physical, so we
                         know what got zapped.

                                   BEN
                         Well why didn't you say so?  You want
                         me to lift some weights or something?

               Reed shakes his head.  He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE.

                                   REED
                         No, just sit back.  We have a good
                         sense of your strength from the
                         firetruck.  We need to find the source
                         of your strength.

               He turns on the X-ray machine.  The graph shows SOLID ROCK. 
               The rays don't penetrate.  Sue and Reed look confused.

                                   BEN
                         How bad is it?  You know I used to
                         smoke.

               Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too
               short to wrap around Ben's arm.  Reed stands stumped.  He
               looks at his tray full of instruments.  He picks up the
               little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER.  But it looks miniscule compared
               to Ben.

               Reed has an idea.  He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS. 
               He pulls of a real HAMMER.  He approaches Ben.

                                   REED
                         Okay, this might smart a little.

               He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS!  SLAMMING
               UP!  RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS!  The ultimate kick in the
               crotch.  Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK,
               wincing.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                             (high-pitched voice)
                         We'll...continue this later.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe
               Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  Flames escape
               through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!

               Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000
               degrees Kelvin.  They are essentially taking his temperature. 

               INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look
               at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  Machines go
               haywire.

               His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot
               or two.  He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.

                                   REED
                         Back it down, Johnny!

                                   JOHNNY
                         I can go hotter!

               He won't stop.  Reed pulls a switch on the wall.  FOAM sprays
               out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames.  He stands there,
               covered in thick FOAM.  His body steams.  So does his temper.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You're really cramping my style here.

                                   SUE
                         You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter,
                         you're approaching supernova --

                         Sweet.

                                   SUE
                         That's the temperature of the sun.

                                   REED
                         Not only could you kill yourself, but
                         you could set fire to Earth's
                         atmosphere and destroy all human life
                         as we know it.

               Reed looks at the control panels.

               Reed and Ben sit in chairs, facing each other.  A beat

               DENTS.  Reed looks down at his clipboard.  A little awkward.

               Reed and Sue, tables turned: Reed observes her through a
               prismatic device measuring light refraction.  He "sees" her
               through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature.  He's
               having a hard time concentrating.  He focuses on his work.

                                   REED
                         It's not "invisibility" per se. 
                         You're bending the light around you
                         with some kind of malleable force

               She reaches for his arm, like a specimen.  He pulls away, but
               she sees a glimpse of BRUISES on his ARMS.  She slows down.

                         Have you had any side-effects, from
                         your powers?

               She considers.  A little vulnerable.

                                   SUE
                         I've had some headaches.  Migraines.

               A beat.  Reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.

                                   REED
                         You should be able to bend light
                         around other objects, even people, if
                         you could control your emotional state
                         better --

                                   SUE
                         Excuse me?

               She is annoyed.  Reed is oblivious.

                                   REED
                         I'm saying, if you had a little more
                         self control, you could locate the
                         trigger.  Can you remember the exact
                         emotions when --

                                   SUE
                         Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

                                   REED
                         Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate
                         that feeling?  Some memory or...

                                   SUE
                             (staring right at him)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She looks at Reed, eyes narrow.  She becomes invisible.  As
               she focuses on Reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear FORCE
               FIELD forms around her body.  The force-field BENDS LIGHT
               around a MICROSCOPE, which goes INVISIBLE.  Reed steps out to
               ask...

                                   REED
                         How's that coming -- whoa --

               The FORCE-FIELD shoots in all directions, knocking everything
               over in a fifteen foot radius.  Reed is thrown from his
               chair.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
                         do that... You must think that was
                         some kind of latent hostility or --

                                   REED
                         What in the world would give me that
                         idea?

               An awkward beat.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I mean, you broke up with me, right?

                                   SUE
                         Are you kidding?

                                   REED
                         No, I distinctly remember: you walked
                         out my door.  Ergo...

               She didn't want to get into this.  She looks down,
               vulnerable.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  I was ready for the next step,
                         you weren't, ergo, I walked.

                                   REED
                         I think it was a little more
                         complicated than --

                                   SUE
                         I just wanted to share an apartment. 
                         What was so complicated about that?

               The question stumps him.  A beat.  He struggles.

                                   REED
                         There were a lot of variables to
                         consider --

                                   SUE
                         No.  There weren't.  There was you. 
                         And me.  No variables, no math.  It
                         was actually the simplest thing in the
                         world.  But your head got in the way...
                         like it always does.

               Her words penetrate.  He knows she's right.  He looks away.

                                   REED
                         Sue...I just...I thought...

               He struggles for the words.

                                   SUE
                         Same old Reed.  Too much thinking...

               He opens his mouth, but...WHAM!  Doors open.  Johnny enters,
               wearing a CHARRED SHIRT.  He points to the burned scraps of
               his shirt.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay guys, we have a serious problem.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from
               various closets/containers:

                                   REED (V.O.)
                         Our uniforms were exposed to the storm
                         like us.  So they can transform like
                         us, becoming invisible, changing size
                         on demand or remaining impervious to
                         flame.

               REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves
               in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  No boots, no gloves.  Not
               yet.  (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes).

                                   BEN
                         You look like an eighties rock band.

                             (to Ben)
                         The suit will stretch.  You should try
                         it --

                                   BEN
                         I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

                                   JOHNNY
                         He's right.  These costumes are...
                         missing something.  I can't put my
                         finger on it --

                                   REED
                         They're not costumes.

                                   SUE
                         We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we
                         need to stay here till we've stabilized.
                        
               Johnny shakes his head, frustrated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm getting sick of being trapped
                         here.  NASA wasn't even this strict!

               He marches out.  Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing.  Sue
               heads out, leaving Ben and Reed.  A beat.  Ben looks at Reed.

                                   BEN
                             (looking at uniform)
                         Maybe it's missing a utility belt. 

               Off Reed's dark look, we hear:

                                   VICTOR (V.O.)
                         So what's the prognosis?

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON: an X-RAY.  Victor's ARM.  The metallic
               transformation is higher now.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor
               and his DOCTOR.  In the wall behind them: ancient armor
               (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  It adds a little
               menace to the room.

                                   DOCTOR
                         Your tissue, your organs, your entire
                         biophysical structure is changing. 
                         Every system is still functioning,
                         somehow --

                         And they're changing into...

                         I don't really know.  A compound
                         organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than
                         titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than
                         diamonds --

                                   DOCTOR
                         At this rate, the infection should be
                         complete in two, maybe three weeks --

                         I wish I could tell you.  I can't
                         pretend to know what we're dealing
                         with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --

               Victor hardens, razor sharp.

                                   VICTOR
                         What?

                                   DOCTOR
                         The Center for Disease Control.  If
                         this thing is contagious --

               WHHM!  Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the
                         face of a billion-dollar-company... We
                         need to keep this confidential,
                         understand?

               Victor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat.

                                   DOCTOR
                         But...this disease...is progressive...
                         degenerative...

                                   VICTOR
                         That's terrible news...

               With one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm
               into the doctor, killing him instantly.  Victor retracts his
               arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter
               Building, spending hours searching for the cure.  He checks
               charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.

               Finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where
               Ben's CHARTS are projected (both Ben and Thing's anatomies). 
               Reed wears the uniform under his labcoat.  He checks his
               equations over and over, making notes upon notes.

                                   REED
                         Nothing...nothing...nothing...

               He hits the end of the slides.  The wall fills with white
               light.  Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH! 
               Something FALLS off the end of the desk.

               Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face.  He steps
               over to see...a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered. 
               Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Of course...of course...the cloud...

               THE COSMIC STORM swirls, terrifying.  We slowly PULL BACK TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MAIN LAB - NIGHT

               The STORM is a computer-image on screen now.  Behind the
               screen are six chalkboards full of Reed's calculations and
               the scribbled beginnings of a MACHINE.

               We PULL BACK to see his arm stretched across the room writing
               on the end of another chalkboard.

               He's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic.  He
               hears...a CREAK.  He slows down, but doesn't look up to see
               SUE enter.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing?

                         particles are still charged.  With the
                         right amount of energy, those ions
                         could create the elemental profile of
                         the cosmic storm.

               He rifles through a desk drawer, then heads out.  Sue stands
               there, looking at the storm.  Concerned.  Then we CUT TO --

                         the city grid...

               He keeps his head down, making notes, entering --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - STOREROOM - NIGHT

               Reed and Sue enter.  Reed is looking for something.  Sue
               slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam-packed with
               GEAR, GADGETS, BLUEPRINTS, INVENTIONS.  Awe-inspiring,
               overflowing.

                                   SUE
                         You really need to get a janitor.

               She stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         This must be what it looks like inside
                         your head.

               Reed finds his electron microscope.  He turns to Sue,
               defensive:

                                   REED
                         There's a system to it.

               She starts to pull out a MODEL of the FANTASTICAR.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Wait!  Sue, don't touch tha--

               The little car sets the whole shelf off balance.  A WAVE OF
               INVENTIONS COME CLATTERING DOWN!  Reed moves fast:

               He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF,
               pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND! 

               Reed and Sue hit the floor.  A close call.  Now more
               closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped
               around her.  A heated beat.  Their first real intimate
               moment.

                                   SUE
                         Sorry.  My fault.  I won't...touch
                         anything.

               As if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, Sue and
               Reed stand, backing off.  As they part, we see:

               BEN watching from the doorway.  Melancholy.  He disappears. 
               We slowly MOVE TO...A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in a VENT GRATE.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches a bank of videoscreens.  He has the Baxter
               Building under surveillance.  He sees Reed and Sue on
               monitors.  He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved
               hand.

               A door opens.  Leonard enters.  He sees the screens.

                                   LEONARD
                         Is Reed any closer to a cure?

               Victor looks at that image of Reed and Sue on the screen.

                                   VICTOR
                         The only thing he's closer to is
                         Sue...

               But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall. 
               He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to
               his will.  He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:

               REED'S BLUEPRINTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER.  Victor's
               eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Make me a reservation for two at
                         Cipriani tonight.

               Victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         And get this over to Ben Grimm.

               Victor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  As he gets
               closer, his screens go STATICKY.  He absentmindedly picks at
               his SCAR.  In shadows, we see skin peeling off.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em
                         closed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT

               BEN GRIMM stands front and center.  Not the Thing.  But BEN
               GRIMM.  A normal man.  He smiles wide, shaking his head.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         You surprised?

               Now we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The
               Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old
               life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the
                         fire department didn't shut this down.

               ON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a
               SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy. 
               On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together.

                                   THE THING
                         God.  I was good looking.

               We hear the party sing "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."  Debbie kisses Ben. 
               Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out
               candles.

                                   DEBBIE (ON SCREEN)
                         What did you wish for, honey?

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         I already got it.  Everything I want.

               As they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.  The tape ends,
               and he sits in darkness for a beat.  A long, lonely beat.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLS - NIGHT

               Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. 
               As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:

               REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is
               STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just
               shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM... 

               UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The
               muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach... 

               REED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in
               his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES. 
               His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his
               skin.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Damn, Stretch!

               Reed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall.

                                   JOHNNY
                         How far's that rubber bend?

               Reed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring.

                                   REED
                         That's what I'm trying to calculate. 
                         And it's not rubber.  It's muscle,
                         tendon.  I seem to have the ability to
                         manipulate the malleability of my
                         molecular structure and redistribute
                         my density to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Right, whatever, have fun.

               And Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP.  It starts
               to POP in his hand, the bag swelling.  He casually turns on a
               TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES.  The Jiffy Pop swells, ready
               to blow.  He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the
               games:

               Cool stunts, hot girls.  Johnny's brow furrows, a thought
               forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT

               A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora. 
               Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Dark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A
               shadow emerges.  Ben.  He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a
               classic Brooklyn tavern.  Neon sign.  Music, life inside. 
               Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes
               through the door into --

               INT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT

               A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a
               place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He
               moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way.

               Ben reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH! 
               The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard. 
               Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.

                                   BEN
                         That's not funny!

               They go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out,
               scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar.

                                   ERNIE
                         Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first
                         mook from Brooklyn to go to outer
                         space, so pay him some respect!

               But the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary.

                                   BEN
                         Ernie.  Sorry for killing your
                         business.  I'll take the usual, then
                         I'm out... Better make it a double.

               Ernie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his
               head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the
               bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA
               MASTERS.

                                   ALICIA
                         Who killed the party?

               She turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack
               of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind.

                                   ERNIE (O.S.)
                         Make it a triple.  On the house,
                         Benny.

               Ben takes his drink, but SMASH!  His grip shatters the glass,
               spilling all over himself.  He smiles ruefully.

                                   BEN
                         If there's a God, she hates me.

               He grabs a bar-rag to dry off.

                                   ALICIA
                         I don't think She's real big on hate.

                                   BEN
                         You wouldn't say that, if you could
                         see me.

               She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.

                                   ALICIA
                         Can I...?  See you...?

               Ben doesn't say anything.  A little unnerved by this woman.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         It's okay, I won't bite...
                             (feeling his arm)
                         ...not that I could.

               She puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and
               gentle touch allows Ben to let her.  She smiles softly.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         Such a sad face... You know, sometimes
                         being different isn't a bad thing.

                                   BEN
                         Trust me, this ain't one of those
                         times.

               She smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.

                                   ALICIA
                         See you round, Benny...

               Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         I'm Alicia, by the way.

               Ben watches her disappear.  He sees a few people staring.  He
               lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new
               drink, in a steel MARTINI SHAKER.  He knocks it back.

               EXT./INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Lights twinkle.  A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs. 
               Heads turn, whispers flutter.  SUE steps out, joining...
               Victor at a prime table.  He pulls out her chair, wearing
               gloves.

                                   VICTOR
                         Thank you for coming out to see me.

               She nods, a little self-conscious.

                                   SUE
                         You said it was urgent.

                                   VICTOR
                         It is.  There's something we need to
                         talk about.  Something I need to ask
                         you...

               Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.

                                   SUE
                             (slow, careful)
                         Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I
                         want you to know I appreciate
                         everything you've done for me, but I
                         just don't --

                                   VICTOR
                         Susan.  What are you doing?

               He is cold as ice.  If he's hurt, he'll never show it.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         You think I brought you here to talk
                         about us?  Please.  This is business.
                             (leaning forward, intense)
                         I need to know: how close is Reed
                         to finding to a cure?

               She pauses.  Then:

                                   SUE
                         He's working round the clock.  But the
                         data needs to be tested, analyzed
                         before --

                                   VICTOR
                         Same old Reed.  All analysis, no
                         action.  Wasn't that the problem with
                         you two?

               She holds tight, keeping cool.

                                   SUE
                         If these molecules aren't stable, they
                         could make us worse, maybe even kill
                         us.

                                   VICTOR
                         Then why is Reed dragging his feet? 
                         Maybe he likes having his prize
                         specimen under glass...
                             (closer, cruel)
                         It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally
                         the perfect woman for him...because
                         you're his science project.

               The words sting.  She can't help but hear some truth in them.

                                   SUE
                         Please don't make this personal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Oh, I think you already have.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, we can't do anything until the
                         research is ready.

               Victor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX.

                                   VICTOR
                         "We," huh?

               Victor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard
               that he SPILLS water.  Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.  Victor
               gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Don't forget who you work for, Susan. 
                         So get to work.  And do your job.

               He walks out.  As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out
               of his pocket.  He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the
               dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.

               Sue sits embarrassed.  She slowly...disappears.  People gasp. 
               She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT
               through the air.  At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN --

                                   BUSINESSMAN
                         I wish my wife would disappear.

               The other men laugh, but WHHM!  The man's wine SPILLS into
               his LAP!  Sue walks out.  The restaurant is left buzzing. 
               Lights twinkle.  And we FADE OUT.  A beat.  Then we CRASH
               INTO --

               EXT. NYC ARENA - ESPN MOTO X GAMES - DAY

               The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills
               and ramps...where MOTO-BIKES launch into the air to the
               delight of 20,000 fans.  The Riders spin and flip, performing
               aerial acrobatics on their 250CC motor bikes.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
                         a special guest for you... Johnny
                         Storm of the Fantastic Four!

               JOHNNY emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the
               crowd.  He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep.  He
               beelines to RONNIE RENNER.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan.

               Ronnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by
               this circus freak.

               The other bikers approach.

                                   KENNY BARTRAM
                         Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take
                         her for a spin?

               He motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine.

                                   RONNIE RENNER
                         Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some
                         tricks...if you can keep up.

               We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO --

               INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY

               Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. 
               Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with
               the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. 
               Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER
                         A rock-solid double-flip!

               The CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the
               hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Look at that lift, ladies and
                         gentlemen!

               Johnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie
               tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump,
               and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and
                         whipped!

               He lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS
               his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning. 
               He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A
                         720?

               Johnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the
               last hill.  He leans over his handlebars.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         He's going for a Kiss of Death!

               Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING
               STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And...
               
               JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to
               streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! 
               LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A
               FLAMING BLUR!

               And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts
               to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling
               upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                             (hand over mic)
                         Is he......flying?

               A beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down! 
               LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing,
               maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny
               swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face.  What
               the hell just happened??

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         You've just seen the first...the
                         first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH!

               A new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing
               ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike:

               THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY
                         My bad.  Sorry about that.
                             (a glance to Ronnie)
                         Thanks for the lesson, bro.

               HOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a
               scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING

               Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses
               on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to
               disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as
               well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet:

                                   SUE
                         That's new...

               Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down,
               preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Have you read these...?  From all
                         over.  People want us to fight crimes... 
                         save their kids...solve their problems...
                             (no response from Reed)
                         ...when we can't even solve our
                         own.

               She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Reed.  How close are we to a cure?

                                   REED
                         No way to know.  Without more
                         tests, experiments.

               She considers.  Victor's words echo in her head.

                                   SUE
                         We're not specimens, we're patients. 
                         This isn't just another science
                         project to you, is it...?

               Reed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!!

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY

               CRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and
               Sue rush in.

                                   REED
                         BEN!  What?  What's going on!?

               Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES.

                                   X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what can you tell us about the
                         outfit?

               REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is
               peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit,
               revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST.

               Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge
               18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Not too much, but I will say that it's
                         all weather and no leather.  Kind of
                         Armani meets Astronaut.

               Ben, Sue, and Reed stare at the wall-sized TV.  Mouths agape.

                                   SUE
                         He didn't.

                                   BEN
                         Oh, he did.

                                   SUE
                         What did he do to the uniform?!

               She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back
               his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.

                                   REED
                         He talked me into it.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what are your superhero names?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies
                         call me Torch.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about the rest of the team?

               Johnny hadn't really thought about them.  He spitballs:

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Uh, we call my sister the invisible
                         girl...the Invisible Girl.

                                   SUE
                         Girl...?!

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         That's easy to remember.  And Reed
                         Richards?  He's the leader.  So
                         what's he?  Mr. Fantastic?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader.

               Reed shrugs.  He doesn't hate the name.

                                   BEN
                         Could be worse.

               Case in point: a photo of Ben fills the TV.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about this one?  What do you call
                         this Thing?

               Johnny smiles, looking right into camera.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would
                         have gone with The Rock, but it was
                         taken.  And "Thing" pretty much sums
                         it up.

               A LAUGH from the studio audience.

                                   BEN
                             (matter-of-fact)
                         Okay.  I'm gonna go kill him now.

               He turns to go.  Reed wraps an arm around Ben.

                                   REED
                         Ben!  Slow down a second and --

               He sees a photo of himself on screen.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         Is it true what they say?  That he can
                         expand any part of his anatomy?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Actually, between us, I think he's got
                         some problems staying rigid.

                                   REED
                             (finishing his thought to Ben)
                         ...wait for me...

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         Which may explain why this woman's
                         not smiling.

               They put up a shot of Susan.

                                   SUE
                         I'm driving.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Dude.  That's my sister.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - DAY

               The Thing rounds the corner.  Sees a crowd of girls lined up
               near a red PORSCHE parked out front...with "TORCHED" on the
               plates.  Ben slows down, smiles.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - A LITTLE LATER

               Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in
               the line.  Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents. 

               Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (looking around)
                         Where's my ride?

               The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED
               JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in
               front of Johnny.  The Valet timidly holds out the keys...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         What the?!  Is that my --

               Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the
               license plate.  It rattles to the ground, face up.

               Johnny rubs the sting out of his head.  Looks up and sees Ben
               in the distance, dusting off his hands.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (shouting: to Ben)
                         You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
                             (seeing Sue)
                         What?!

                                   SUE
                         You gave us names?  What are you, the
                         "face" of the Fantastic Four now?

               Ben marches up.  Hands balled into fists.

                                   BEN
                         It's about to be a broken face.

                                   REED
                         This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need
                         to be careful until we're normal
                         again.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What if some of us don't want to be
                         "normal" again?  We didn't all turn
                         into monsters like --

               Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.  Stops himself. 
               Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.

               Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the
               head.  Ben stops.  Turns around more shocked than hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Did you just --

               Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.  This time in the face.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want
                         to fly?  Fly.

               Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps
               in the way!  Too late!  WHAMM!  Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO
               REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's
               fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet. 

               BAM!  Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a
               BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.  WHOOSH!  He
               leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.

               The crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop. 

               Johnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck
               begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he
               stands.  Heating up.  Both his hands are now flaming fists of
               fury.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see if we can get blood from a
                         stone.

               He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them. 
               High Noon.  They start to RUN toward each other...

               When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM,
               stops them both in their tracks with just a look.  Like a
               mom:

                                   SUE
                         You two need a time-out.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Blockhead started it!

               Ben just stalks off.  The crowd clears, scared.  A PAPARAZZI
               snaps a picture.  Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens.

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         Damn it, Johnny.

               She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk.

                                   REED
                         You need to control yourself and think
                         before you --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if
                         we got these gifts for a reason?  What
                         if we have some, you know...like,
                         calling?

                                   REED
                         A higher calling like getting girls
                         and making money?

               Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is there any higher?

               Reed looks at him, disgusted.  Johnny waves to the crowd,
               hand flaming.  People SHRIEK, snap pictures.  Johnny smiles at
               Reed.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This is who we are Reed.  Accept it. 
                         Or better yet: enjoy it.

               Johnny steps into the sea of fans.  Reed stands alone.

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY

               Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.  Tries to catch
               up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Slow down...

               Ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  She catches up.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. 
                         He's always been a hothead --

                                   BEN
                         It's not him.  It's them.
                             (pointing to crowd)
                         I can't live like this.

                                   SUE
                         Just give Reed a little more time.
                         You know how he works -- analyzing
                         every little step before he takes
                         one --

                                   BEN
                         It's easy for you to be patient.

                                   SUE
                         No, it's not.  I thought I was done
                         waiting for Reed... We're all in this
                         together now, Ben.

               He slows down, gets closer, intense.

                                   BEN
                         Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got
                         no idea what I'd give...to be
                         invisible.  Your nightmare...is my
                         dream.

               She opens her mouth, but has no response.  She doesn't know
               his depth of pain.  As he disappears into the alley, we CUT
               TO --

               INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               The news plays on the TV.  Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the
               screen on an image of...THE THING.  He turns to Victor, who
               sits with the rest of the bankers.  Cold, sterile
               environment.

                                   NED CECIL
                         This is how you "turn things around"? 
                         These freaks are on the front page and
                         your company's in the obituaries.

               Victor has a larger bandage on his face now.

                                   VICTOR
                         I have a plan to use their publicity
                         for --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough
                         already.  This isn't a negotiation. 
                         It's a notification.  We're pulling
                         out.

               A cold, silent beat.  Victor leans forward.

                                   VICTOR
                         You need to look long-term here. 
                         Without risk, there's no --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Reward.  We all know the sales
                         pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're
                         done buying... Gentlemen.

               He motions to his men.  They all stand.  Victor is the lone
               man sitting.  PUSH IN on Victor's face, his inner rage
               palpable.  A few quick surges of electricity emanate from his
               body.  This man is getting stronger, more electric.

               INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY

               After hours.  The floor is slick with water -- puddles in
               every direction.  Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator,
               heading for his car.  As he goes, the structure lights start
               to flicker.  Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by
               one, furthest to closest.  He looks around.  Unnerved by the
               darkness.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Hello...?

               A hanging beat.  Victor steps out from shadows.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                             (relieved, almost)
                         Von Doom?  Gave me a little shock.  No
                         hard feelings, right?  Nothing
                         personal.

               Victor says nothing.  Ned keeps going.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         You know, you could always move back
                         to Latvura, start fresh.

               He mispronounces Latveria, dripping condescension.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         Maybe that's where you belong, back in
                         the "old country."

               That does it.  A surge of electricity courses through Victor. 
               His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to
               THE GROUND.  The electric spark hits the water and...

               ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING
               LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric
               snakes), heading straight for Ned.  His eyes go wide.  And...
              
               NED IS ELECTROCUTED!  His body spasms.  THUD!  He slumps,
               dead.  Smoke rises from his body.  Victor stands, power
               swelling.

               For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL
               GLOW beneath the skin.  He remains scary calm.

                                   VICTOR
                         It's pronounced Latveria.
                             (looking down at the dead body)
                         This meeting's over, Ned.

               Victor walks away, the final lights going to DARKNESS.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor enters, still adrenalized.  He turns to the light
               switch, and the lights come on.  He approaches his screens,
               and the monitors flicker to life.  His powers are growing. 

               One MONITOR rolls the news.  IMAGES of the FANTASTIC FOUR. 
               Victor leans closer, and the VOLUME automatically goes up.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                         ...the Fantastic Four put on quite a
                         show last night.  They landed in every
                         major headline in the northern
                         hemisphere.  In related news...

               An IMAGE of VICTOR on screen.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                         Reports have surfaced that Von Doom
                         Industries may be filing for
                         bankruptcy.  You may remember that it
                         was Victor Von Doom who...

               Victor turns away from the screen.  The volume goes down.  He
               focuses his eyes on REED.

               Leonard enters, stepping closer, seeing the faint flicker of
               VICTOR'S METALLIC SCAR.  His eyes narrow, concerned.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, is everything okay?  What
                         happened to your...?

               Victor keeps his eyes on the screen, totally engrossed.

                                   VICTOR
                             (under breath, seething)
                         Reed... He got what he wanted...
                             (looking at Sue)
                         Everything he wanted...he took from me.

               He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed. 
               A hard, deadly beat.  Victor's eyes narrow, zooming
               into...REED'S RESEARCH: SLIDES on the wall.  He zooms into
               key words:

               DANGER, UNSTABLE IONS, MUTATION, OVERLOAD.  And Victor gives
               a slow, thin smile.  A new plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Now I'm going to take it back.  Piece
                         by bloody piece...

               His fist clenches.  We hear METALLIC SFX.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal
               man could balance.  But he is not normal.  His arms are
               wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine. 
               He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...

               VICTOR overseeing a group of TECHNICIANS.  They are boxing up
               Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research.  Victor wears
               a bandage, covering his scar.  Reed eyes a glint of METAL.

                                   REED
                         Victor, are you...are you okay? 

               Victor turns away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Don't worry about me.  Worry about
                         yourself.

               Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.

                                   REED
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         What I should have done a long time
                         ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. 
                         This all belongs to me.

               Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.

                                   REED
                         But I'm not done with the machine --

                                   VICTOR
                         Which is precisely the point.
                         Analysis is over.  It's time for
                         action.  My men could have mass-
                         produced this by now.

               Reed shakes his head, defending himself.

                                   REED
                         Mass-produced?  This isn't a
                         toaster.  You have no idea how it
                         works.

               Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the
               intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE.  He points to parts:

                                   VICTOR
                         Re-create the storm, invert the
                         polarity here, reverse the mutation
                         there.  Don't talk to me like I'm some
                         schoolboy.  I've got the same Phd you
                         do.

               Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with
               his machine.  He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.

                                   REED
                         The storm needs to be handled exactly
                         right, or it could make our mutations
                         worse, much worse, maybe even kill
                         us...

               Victor slows.  Is Reed getting to him?  Or giving him ideas?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Victor, please.  We need time to
                         verify the data... We can't afford any
                         mistakes -- there's only enough ions
                         for two or three attempts.

               Victor considers.  He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed.  I'm not asking permission.
                             (a final verdict)
                         We'll build it, while you check the
                         specs.

               Victor walks out.  Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               The SHIELDS slowly rise.  FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work.  They
               wear the VDI jackets.  Reed watches, worried.

               Sue enters.  She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI
               logo.  And she is deeply worried.  She steps over to Reed. 
               Sparks fly behind them.  Drills scream.

                                   SUE
                         Can I talk to you?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed.  Quiet, urgent:

                                   SUE
                         Don't let Victor push you into making
                         a mistake --

                                   REED
                         He was going to take away all my data,
                         equipment --

                                   SUE
                         Better than your life.  Victor's not
                         the one who has to get into that
                         thing.  We are.

               Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.

                                   REED
                         Which is why I'm working twenty hours
                         a day, checking every variable --

                                   SUE
                         Every variable but yourself.  You
                         don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in
                         your head like --

                                   REED
                             (finally losing it)
                         I'm not the only one in there.  I got
                         you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling
                         around in there.

               Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  A beat.

                                   SUE
                         So clear it out.  Get out of your
                         head.  Get out of here...

               He looks at her, knowing what she means.  Where she means.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,
               mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE
               GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.

                                   LITTLE GIRL
                         Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My
                         kitty is stuck in a tree.

               She gestures to a tree next to Ben.  Looks up.

                                   LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                         Please save Miss Lucy.

               Ben rolls his eyes.  Looks up.  Considers climbing the tree,
               but thinks better of it.  He has another idea...

               Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap
               out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!

               The cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks
               out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands
               the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. 
               He just moves on.

               EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE
               SCULPTURE of his bust.

               He stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely
               rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the
               haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched,
               but...

                                   BEN
                             (under breath)
                         Eyebrows are a little big...

               A beat.  He stares at these images of himself.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I figured the only way to get you here
                         was to stick that in the window.

               He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.

                                   BEN
                         How'd you know it was me?

                                   ALICIA
                         I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?

               He steps toward her.  But he sees...a PARTY in the back part
               of the gallery.  Ben pauses, a little insecure.

                                   BEN
                         I'm not really dressed for a party.

                                   ALICIA
                         Relax, it's casual.

                                   BEN
                         No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty... 

               She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --

               INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT

               WHOOSH!  A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at
               BEN.  Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING
               CHISELS for his cracks.  Intricate, intimate work.

               Ben enjoys every moment.  He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in
               the corner.

                                   BEN
                         Those yours too?

                                   ALICIA
                         My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into
                         stone.  I was wondering when you'd
                         walk by.

                                   THE THING
                         You know, you could'a run an ad in the
                         personals.

                                   ALICIA
                         "Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
                         rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual
                         relationship."

                                   THE THING
                         This ain't permanent.  My friend
                         Reed's working on a cure...I think.

               She gets closer, running her hands across his arm.

                                   ALICIA
                         Bennie.  You feel pretty good as is.

               Ben bristles.  He doesn't want to stay this way.

                                   THE THING
                         You don't know what it's like out
                         there.  Walking around like some kind
                         of circus freak.  People staring,
                         whispering --

                                   ALICIA
                         I wouldn't know anything about that.

                                   THE THING
                         I mean...

                                   ALICIA
                         Tell me.  When you grew up in
                         Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you
                         know?
                             (a beat)
                         You went your own way then.  You
                         didn't listen to people.  So why start
                         now...?

               As he ponders that, we hear a CROWD SWELLING on the CUT TO --

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Fans swarm JOHNNY.  He signs autographs, poses for pictures. 
               Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO.  A
               tinted window rolls down.  Victor's face emerges.

                                   VICTOR
                         Need a ride, Johnny?

               EXT./INT. LIMO - NIGHT

               Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.

                                   VICTOR
                         A few fans.  Hope you don't mind.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Gotta take care of the fans, right? 

               He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, I built my business knowing what
                         people want.  And right now, the
                         people want you.

               Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.

                                   JOHNNY
                         And we don't want to let the people
                         down now, do we?

                                   VICTOR

                         No we don't.  Which is why we need
                         to strike while the iron's hot. 
                         I'm talking action figures,
                         videogames, sponsors --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Videogames?  You serious?

               Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You talk to Reed and Sue about this?

                                   VICTOR
                         Johnny.  Let's be honest here.  Ben,
                         Reed, Sue.  Good people, all.  But
                         stars?
                             (shaking his head, a beat)
                         I don't want to break up the band, but
                         you're the one they want.  Don't you
                         think it's time to go solo...?

               Victor subtly nods to the models.  They envelop Johnny.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Take the car for a spin.  Think about
                         it.  Is this the life you want?  Or
                         would you rather live in Reed's
                         lab...?

               The car stops.  Victor gets out.  He stands on the pavement. 
               As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny. 
               The door shuts, and...

               WHHHMMMPF!  The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!

               INT. HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

               STARS on the ceiling.  A VOICE drones about the galaxy.  In
               the LAST ROW, we find: Reed and Sue.  Reed is thinking about
               work.

                                   REED
                         I could get Ben to tap into the
                         Baxter's main power to generate enough
                         voltage --

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look
                         up.

               He slowly looks up.  The stars seem to calm him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Remember our first date here...?  God,
                         I was so nervous.

                                   REED
                         You were?

                                   SUE
                         Of course I was.  I'd read all your
                         papers on bioethics.  Some of them two
                         times just so I'd have something to
                         say to you.

               Reed smiles softly, thinking back.

                                   REED
                         You know, I bribed the projectionist
                         ten bucks to keep it open late?

                                   SUE
                         I gave him twenty.

               They laugh.  Sue looks up to the stars.  Quiet:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         I didn't want that night to end.

               Reed looks at her.  Wrestles with a decision.  Then quietly:

                                   REED
                         Sue, you were right.  It wasn't
                         complicated.  I just wasn't ready to
                         be...to become...
                             (a beat)
                         You can be a little intimidating. 

               She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         You always talked about how you liked
                         the kind of man who could approach
                         you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't
                         afraid to tell you what he wanted.

                                   SUE
                         I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted
                         you to be that man.

               Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         When I walked out, I waited ten
                         minutes outside your door.  Ten. 
                         Waiting for you to come find me.

                                   REED
                         Why didn't you say something?

                                   SUE
                         That would have kinda defeated the
                         purpose.  And Reed...
                             (closer, emotional)
                         I'm saying it now.

               Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their
               faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue
               disappears.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                             (quiet, playful)
                         Come find me.

               Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...

                                   SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft,
               tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT

               Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. 
               A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips
               her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal.

                                   ALICIA
                         Look around.  I'll get us drinks. 
                         They always let blind girls cut the
                         line.

               She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. 
               The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is
               the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling
               hard.

               Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained
               smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. 
               He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.
               
               Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him,
               thinking he's just an inanimate statue.

                                   PATRON
                         I don't know about this one.  It lacks
                         a certain...realism.

               Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN
               GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         She's always had a thing for runaways
                         and strays, but this is ridiculous.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #2
                         I know.  Did she really think these
                         sculptures would sell?

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         Like anybody would want this thing in
                         their house.  That girl's a one-woman
                         charity.

               Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the
               room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He
               glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten
               seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. 

               We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging
               where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for
               him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his
               heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. 

               THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --

               EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT

               A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN
               sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. 
               Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a
               metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then...

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         This seat taken?

               Ben turns to see...VICTOR.

                                   BEN
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm worried about you.

                                   BEN
                         About me?  How sweet.

                                   VICTOR
                         Come on.  Let me buy you something to
                         eat.  Looks like you could use the
                         company.

               Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat.

               INT. DINER - LATER

               Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a
               foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge
               plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other
               customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles
               the plates.

                                   THE THING
                         'Scuse me.

                                   VICTOR
                         I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't
                         changed that much for Reed, Sue and
                         Johnny.  At least they can go out in
                         public.  But for you?  People staring.
                         Whispering behind your back...

                                   THE THING
                         If you're trying to cheer me up you're
                         doing a helluva job --

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm just saying, I know what it's like
                         to lose something you love.  To see it
                         slip away, and know it's never coming
                         back.

               The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.

                                   THE THING
                         Reed's gonna fix me up --

                                   VICTOR
                         For your sake I hope you're right. 
                         I'm sorry if that sounds a little
                         skeptical.

                                   THE THING
                         Skeptical...?

               Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure
               points.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, he's a brilliant man, we should
                         trust he's working as hard as he can. 
                         You're his best friend.  So what
                         possible reason could he have for
                         taking his time?
                             (a beat)
                         I mean, other than getting close to
                         Sue?

               Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't
               help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  Reed
               turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN.  He
               sits waiting, scowling.  They stop laughing immediately.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, I have that effect on people.

               The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete. 
               The Technicians are gone now.

                                   REED
                         Ben --

                                   BEN
                         Oh, you remember my name do you?  You
                         happen to remember what you swore to
                         do with every breath in your body?

                                   REED
                         We're working as hard as we can --

                                   BEN
                         Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.

               He motions to Reed and Sue together.

                                   REED
                         Come on, this is nothing.

               Sue looks a little hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Glad "nothing" could take you away
                         from your work.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I don't know if this thing'll
                         change us back or make us worse. 
                         I need you to be patient for a little
                         while longe--

               He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around
               it like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  Ben pushes Reed back.  Hard.

                                   BEN
                         Look at me, Reed.  Look at me!

               He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin.  He
               THROWS Reed back.  Reed slams down to the ground.

                                   REED
                         I am looking.  That's why I can't make
                         a mistake!  I've got to get it right,
                         and it's not right yet!  We need to
                         test this.

               Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed.

                                   BEN
                         I spent my whole life protecting you,
                         from the schoolyard to the stars.  For
                         what?  So you could play Twister with
                         your girlfriend while I'm the freak of
                         the week?

               Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back.  Reed slams
               into the wall, and stays down this time.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it.

               She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields.

                                   BEN
                         Stay out of this Susie.

               As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben
               up like a python.  They struggle.  Ben runs back into a wall
               to shake Reed.  Their faces are close, heated.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Good thing you're flexible enough to
                         watch your own back.  'Cause you're on
                         your own now.

               Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go.  Ben walks out.  Sue
               comes to Reed's side.  He's bleeding.

                                   REED
                         I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop
                         him.

               She heads out.  Reed slowly stands.  He looks at the
               transformation machine.  It's not ready.  But...Reed steps
               toward it.  As he walks, his image goes grainy in --

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every
               step.  This is what Victor has been waiting for.  His screens
               flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull
               back.  He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE.  Hits a countdown. 
               And he grabs his UNIFORM...

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sue hustles down the long hall.  Ben turns a corner, passing
               the elevators, heading toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She gets
               there too late.  Doors close, going down.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Ben pounds across the lobby.  He sees Johnny coming in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Christmas come early!  Check it out!

               He holds up an ACTION FIGURE of BEN: a horribly bloated body
               topped by a tiny pinhead.  Johnny pushes a button and --

                                   BEN ACTION FIGURE
                         IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!

               WITH ONE ARM, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall.  With his other
               hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches
               from Johnny's head.  The toy lodges into the plaster.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey!  That's a prototype!

                                   BEN
                         Go back to the drawing board.

               He strides away.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               DING.  Sue speeds out of the elevator.  No sign of Ben.  She
               runs into...JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny?  Did you see Ben?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm
                         done with this freak show.  I'm moving
                         back to the real world.

                                   SUE
                         Is that what you call it?  "Real"?

                                   JOHNNY
                         At least it beats living in a lab like
                         somebody's science project.

               This hits home.  Sue is quiet.  Johnny turns to go.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know
                         mom didn't raise us to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Look around, sis!  She's not here.  So
                         you can stop talking to me like I'm
                         your little boy --

                                   SUE
                         As soon as you stop acting like one. 
                         Come on, you're smarter than this. 
                         You think those people out there care
                         about you?  You're just a fad to them.

               He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's try something new: you live
                         your life.  And I'll live mine.
                             (beat)
                         And just for the record: they LOVE
                         me.

               He strides into the night, leaving Sue alone.  A dark night. 
               The Fantastic Four is no more.  The family is split apart.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               The transformation chamber is up and running.  Numbers count
               down.  The storm swirls in the chamber.  Reed now wears the
               UNIFORM.  He opens the door:

               HE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF.  HE IS FINALLY TAKING
               ACTION.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor sits enthralled.  He leans forward, breathless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed gets closer.  His heart races.  So does Victor's.  A
               moment of truth for both of them.  REED STEPS INTO THE
               MACHINE.

               Reed looks up at the cosmic storm.  He opens his arms, ready
               to risk his life.  And...WHHHM!  He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION,
               RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO --

               VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               His screens GO BLACK.  He looks out the window to see...a
               flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING.  The tip of the Baxter glows. 
               The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Lights go haywire.  Sue knows immediately...

                                   SUE
                         Oh god, Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Lights flicker in darkness.  The door rips open.  Sue lunges
               inside.  She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in
               the chamber.  A beat.  Did it work?  Then...

               Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND.  His eyes flutter back.  Dead...? 
               His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard,
               while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.

                                   SUE
                         What did you do, Reed?  What did you
                         do?

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches every second on his monitors.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Sue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED
               OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  One side of
               his face looks like it's MELTING OFF.

                                   REED
                         I can...make it work.

                                   SUE
                         Reed, stop, you need to rest your --

                                   REED
                         The power...I need...more power...to
                         control...the storm --

                                   SUE
                         You need a doctor.

               Reed loses consciousness.  Sue carries him out.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands.

                                   VICTOR
                         More power...?

               He reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE
               AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON.  His powers growing.

                                   VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                         Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat.

               EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Ben sits alone, looking at city lights.  A man without a
               home.  Without a family.  A hard beat.  HEADLIGHTS slash
               across Ben.  He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a
               LIMO.

                                   LEONARD
                         Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter
                         building.  It's...Reed.

               Ben considers.  Despite it all, he's a good friend.  And a
               good man.  As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC
               IN --

               INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

               LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS.  A young crowd dances and
               grinds to the beat.  Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF
               FLAME swirl around the ceiling.  We follow them to:

               A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. 
               He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get
               a look at his various parlour tricks.

               He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.  Closer.  Candles around
               them start to melt.  Beads of sweat drip down her face.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What do you say we get out of here? 

               She pauses.  And...a very LARGE MAN steps up.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This your boyfriend?

               The Boyfriend doesn't look too happy.

                                   BOYFRIEND
                         Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and
                         stealing chicks...

               Johnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting
               it into a burst of flame.  The Boyfriend drops the glass,
               which SMASHES on the ground...catches the floor on fire.

               The boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out.

                                   GIRLFRIEND
                         What are you doing?!  You could have
                         burned somebody!

               The boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk
               off.  She turns back for one last comment...

                                   GIRLFRIEND (CONT'D)
                         You know, if I had your power I'd be
                         doing something with it, not wasting
                         my time doing cheap bar tricks,
                         hitting on some other guy's girl.

               Johnny looks a little embarrassed.  The couple leaves. 
               Johnny glances around.  His FANS look down, away.  He sees
               how quickly they can turn.  The crowd parts slightly.  He
               looks very alone.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Leonard leads The Thing inside.  The ominous chamber sits
               with its door open.  Victor enters from the control station.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben, come in.

                                   BEN
                         What is this?  Where's Reed?

                                   VICTOR
                         Where do you think?  With Sue.

               Ben looks at the flickering lights.  Suspicious.  Victor
               turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark
               room.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                             (quiet)
                         I'll take it from here, Leonard.

               Leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.

               Leonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         What do you want, Vic?

                                   VICTOR
                         To help you.  I've run every test
                         known to man.  And they all yield the
                         same result: the machine is ready.

               Ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...

                                   BEN
                         Reed said it'd be weeks till --

                                   VICTOR
                         He also said we'd avoid that storm in
                         space.  And we know how that turned
                         out.

               Ben nods.  Reed was wrong before.  Ben gets closer to the
               machine, drawn to it.  He wants to believe, so badly.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         He couldn't generate enough power for
                         the machine to reach critical mass. 
                         Yet another mistake for "Mr.
                         Fantastic."

                                   BEN
                         And you can?  Power it up?

               Victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little SPARK
               around him.  The lights...?  Or his skin...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Yes.  I've found a new energy source.

               He keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course
               with ELECTRICITY.  It starts to build, sparking up his arm.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm
                         again?

               Ben keeps his eyes on the machine.  His dream is alive.

                                   BEN
                         Let's do it.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The chamber doors open.  Thing enters.  He looks around this
               sterile box.  An animal in a cage.  Victor pushes a control;
               the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal.  Thing shuts
               his eyes.  He just wants to be Ben again.

               FROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation
               sequence.  As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in
               the lab.  Energy pumps into the chamber.  The storm swirls
               faster.  Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --

               -- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both
               hands...and WHHHM!  A countdown begins in the control panels. 

               SLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window. 
               The chamber activates.  The storm strikes hard.

               The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony. 
               Struggling violently inside.  To escape?  Extend the moment:
               Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes.

               EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT

               The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie
               glow.  Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of
               the Baxter Building.  The rest of the city lights dim
               slightly.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Reed lies in bed, weak, recuperating.  When the power surges,
               we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that
               someone's using the chamber.  He starts to get out of bed,
               straining to stand with every muscle left in his body.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME

               Sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications.  The lights
               dim.  Power failure.  She looks up...

               EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

               Johnny walks alone.  A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky. 
               He looks up.  His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes
               where it's coming from.  He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris,
               crackling with light.  The chamber rattles dangerously, as
               the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building. 

               And then it's over.  The light dies down...somewhat.  It
               still pulses along with the chamber.  The chamber door SLIDES
               OPEN.

               Beat.  And...BEN GRIMM steps out.  Not The Thing.  No more
               rocks.  BEN GRIMM.  Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN. 

               He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  He
               collapses.  He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.

                                   BEN
                         Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK
                         YOU...VIC?!

               Ben sees a SPARK in shadows.  That spark is...

               VICTOR'S ARM.  Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to
               Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY.  His skin is part
               flesh, part metal.  Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.

               HE IS DOOM.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Vic... What the...?

                                   DOOM
                         Everyone thought I was safe behind
                         those shields...

                                   BEN
                         Victor, the machine worked for me.  It
                         can work for you --

                                   DOOM
                         It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly. 

               Ben starts to realize...

                                   BEN
                         You planned this...?

               Doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from
               his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.

                                   DOOM
                         I've always wanted power.  Now I've
                         got an unlimited supply...

                                   BEN
                         And no Thing to stand in your way. 

               DOOM smiles, nods, stronger than Ben now.

                                   DOOM
                         Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a
                         man looks like who embraces his
                         destiny.

               Doom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying
               backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         One down, three to go.

               Suddenly, WHOOSH!  The lab door flies open.  Reed enters. 
               Doom steps back into the shadows.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Right on cue.

               Reed's eyes go wide.  He sees Ben crumpled in the corner.

                                   REED
                         Oh god Ben.  Are you okay?
                             (amazed)
                         You did it, you really did it...

                                   DOOM
                         No, Reed.  I did.

               Reed slowly turns to see...DOOM.  His body, his face.

                                   REED
                         Victor...?  What, what happened to
                         you?  What did you do to your --

                                   DOOM
                         Exactly what I said I would: I built a
                         better, stronger being.  And
                         outsmarted the great Reed Richards --

                                   REED
                         Victor, this isn't the way to --

                                   DOOM
                             (a dark smile)
                         You always know best.  So tell me. 
                         What happens when you superheat
                         rubber?

               Doom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through
               the huge window!  Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Doom looks out the window, smiling at his old friend's fall.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT

               DING!  The elevator opens.  Doom strides out.  He passes our
               friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka--

               Doom casually SWIPES, sending him through revolving doors.

                                   DOOM
                         Never better, Jimmy.  And it's Doctor
                         Doom now.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali
               watch.  He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't
               get a grip.  His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!  He falls like a
               SLINKY, out of control.  Half his body loose, half hard.

               He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.  He catches
               Reed's face, holds it close.

                                   DOOM
                         Why the long face?

               Doom whips Reed into the night.  As Doom turns, people cower,
               horrified by his face.  They clear out, and...

               Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic
               veins.  A monster.  Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with
               an iron fist, and bounds into the night.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

               Smoke billows, windows are shattered.  Sue races inside,
               seeing Doom's devastation.  Silence, deadly silence. 
               Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift.  BEN crawls out.

                                   SUE
                         Ben?!

               She helps him out of the rubble.  He is beaten, battered.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Sue!

               Johnny comes running in.  He sees the wreckage.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --

                                   SUE
                         No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.

               He nods.  A beat between them.  He looks around, sees Ben.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Jesus, Ben!
                             (eyeing him)
                         I go away, look what happens.  You got
                         a lot of explaining to do.

               He motions to the wreckage.

                                   BEN
                             (struggling, weak)
                         The machine works.  And Vic's gone
                         Mister Hyde on us --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Really?  With a name like Von Doom? 
                         Never saw that one coming.

               Sue looks around.  Only one question.  Dead serious:

                                   SUE
                         Where is Reed?

                                   BEN
                         Victor must've taken him.

               INT. VON DOOM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to
               the opening scene.  Those mysterious CRATES loom in shadows. 
               He wears a green HOOD, and METAL MASK over his scarred face. 

               Doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.

                                   DOOM
                         Chemistry 101, Part Two.  What
                         happens to rubber when it's super-
                         cooled?

               We now see what he sees: Reed sits in a chair with TUBES
               INJECTED into his skin FREEZING HIM SOLID!  Ultra-cold vapor
               coats him.  Doom steps closer, a sadistic smile.

               Reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Allow me.

               He PRESSES DOWN on one of Reed's fingers, which makes a
               horrific CRACKING SOUND.  Reed's face twists with pain.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Painful...?

               Doom seems to enjoy every CRACK.  He leans closer.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         You don't know the meaning of the
                         word.

               Doom lets up on Reed and reaches into a crate, and pulls out
               a military-issue ROCKET-LAUNCHER.  He aims at the city
               skyline, locking onto his target: JOHNNY STORM.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         But you will.

               Johnny's HEAT SIGNATURE glows.  The screen flashes: TARGET
               ACQUIRED.  Doom looks back at Reed, his launcher aimed
               casually over his shoulder.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Flame off.

               BOOOOM!  He fires without looking!  A MISSILE blasts into the
               sky.  THE MISSILE LIGHTS UP THE DARK NIGHT beginning its wide
               turn towards its target.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING

               Johnny, Ben, and Sue hear the missile being fired and turn to
               the window -- it BANKS, coming STRAIGHT for them.  They move
               to --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING BALCONY - NIGHT

               Johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the
               missile streaking closer.  As he moves, the missile SHIFTS
               slightly with HIS MOTION!  His eyes narrow, thinking.

               He FLAMES ON a HAND.  He waves his flaming hand, and the
               MISSILE locks onto the fire!  Johnny darkens, realizing...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Great.  Heat-seeker.

               His mind races.  He makes a decision, and steps up onto the
               ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Sis.  Let me take care of you for
                         once.

                                   SUE
                         But Johnny...you can't fly.

               Johnny considers, a half-beat.  He looks out.  Under breath:

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well then this'll be one hell of a
                         basejump.

               Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF
               THE EDGE!  He FLAMES ON!  The missile follows his arc.  As he
               drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (under breath)
                         Come on...come on...come on...

               He falls lower, lower.  And...he...BANKS!  SWOOPS UP! 
               FLYING!

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         FLAME ON.

               Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.

                                   BEN
                         We need to help Reed --

               Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, you got what we all wanted. 
                         You need to stay here.  It's too
                         dangerous.

               She heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Ben steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered
               window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat.

                                   BEN
                         What...what have I done?

               EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

               Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and
               turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More
               people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Eerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He
               hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom
               even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. 
               And...

               A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being
               manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next
               to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm.

                                   SUE
                         What has he done to you?

               Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.

                                   DOOM (O.S.)
                         How romantic.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, please --

                                   DOOM
                         It's Doctor Doom to you.

               He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin.

                                   SUE
                         We know the machine works.  It worked
                         on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can
                         turn you back --

                                   DOOM
                         Do you really think fate turned us
                         into gods so we could refuse these
                         gifts?

               She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.

                                   SUE
                         Victor.  You always thought you were
                         god.

               Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.

                                   DOOM
                         Sue please, let's not fight.

                                   SUE
                         No, Victor... Let's.

               She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him
               back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. 
               Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity.

                                   DOOM
                         Susan...... You're fired.

               BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. 
               She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING
               to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her
               strength to...GO INVISIBLE.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Marco...

               A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Polo.

               He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to
               the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible.

               In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and
               out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through
               the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...?

               EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

               Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet
               behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots:

               A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast,
               Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. 
               VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly.

               He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes
               in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- 

               JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles
               through the air, we CUT BACK TO --

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. 
               Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.

               Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes
               every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes
               a CRACCCKKKKING sound.

                                   DOOM
                         One more down.  Now it's just the
                         scientist and his specimen.

               Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He
               has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips
               and get the words out.

                                   REED
                         Sue.  The only thing I ever knew
                         without thinking was...
                             (his lips fully freezing)
                         I...love...

               He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue
               whispers to him:

                                   SUE
                         Me too, Reed.

               Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.

                                   DOOM
                             (quiet, cruel)
                         And so four became none.  It's my time
                         now.

               BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH!

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Actually, Vic...

               Reed recognizes the voice.  So do we.  Doom turns to see... 

               BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING.  Back in rocky, fighting form.

                                   BEN
                         IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!

               Doom turns, just as --

               BAM!  Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever
               been hit.  The force sends Doom back through the air, toward
               the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V"
               sculpture.  It SNAPS, crashing onto him.  A few sparks.  Then
               nothing.

               Nothing at all.  No more movement.  Doom is dead.

               Ben turns to Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Damn, I've been wanting to do that.

               Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting
               the tubes from Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                             (Reed's words)
                         Victor's "not that bad," huh?  Just "a
                         little larger than life"?  Maybe
                         you'll listen to me next time before --

               WHMM!  The WRECKAGE shifts.  They turn to see...Doom EMERGES. 
               He stands, power coursing.  And he CHARGES at Ben!  Ben
               charges back.  And these two behemoths...

               SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!

               EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

               Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.  On the ground,
               PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.  Doom and Ben SMASH through
               the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

               BOOOOM!  Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the
               glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL.  People scream, run.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD.  Their combined weight
               CRACKS the floor of the pool.  A YOUNG BOY watches underwater
               through his MASK.  Doom and Ben square off, but...

               The CRACKS OPEN WIDER!  And they're PULLED toward the HOLE! 
               WHOOSH!  The water is all sucked out of the hole.  The boy
               holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --

               INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall.  Roaring rapids
               head straight for him.  He jams his key into the lock,
               turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as
               the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to --

               EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

               SMASH!  Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the
               TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

               CRASH!  Water floods the street.  Doom and Ben land in a
               large GARBAGE TRUCK.  The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING
               from the inside.  Grunts, growls.

               CRASH!  The truck suddenly STOPS.  COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,
               sirens screaming.  And --

               BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.  SMASH!  Ben
               lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks
               the WINDSHIELD.  Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water
               flooding the street around him.  COP CARS converge on Doom. 

               Doom turns his attention to the cops.  His limbs SPARK with
               electricity, ready to fire at the cars.

               EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

               Ben sees the cops and Doom.  He knows the cops are dead meat. 
               He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.

                                   BEN
                         Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your
                         car?

               She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.

                                   OLD LADY
                         The clutch sticks a little.

                                   BEN
                         Not gonna be a problem.

               Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.  WHMM!  It FLIES
               through the air, and WHAM!  Hits hard, knocking Doom back
               twenty feet!  As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

               BOOM!  Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!  CRASH! 
               Windows shatter.  The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,
               snapping the pole.  Doom steps out, unharmed.

               Ben CHARGES toward him.  Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY
               POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a
               giant STUN-GUN!  Electric sparks FLY through the air into -- 

               BEN!  The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!  He goes
               FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --

               WHOOMPF!  Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street! 
               Water rushes into the crater.  Ben lays there, incapacitated.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME

               On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.  Doom
               strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the
               death-blow.  Currents surge.  Right before he swings down --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I can't let you do that.

               Simple, strong.  Doom turns to see...REED.  Alone.  Bruised
               and battered.  Slowly stepping toward him.  Doom smiles.

                                   DOOM
                         And you can't stop me.

               He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING
               DOWN!  Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.

               Something invisible.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Hello Susan.

               She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. 
               Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It
               skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet.

               Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         What is this?  The pitiful three?

               Doom steps toward them, but --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Four.

               WHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a
               flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.

               Johnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of
               them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Had a little relapse, huh?

               Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Welcome back.

               They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed
               and melted, making him look all the more menacing.

                                   DOOM
                         This is going to be fun.

               Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at
               the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a
               thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!

               He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He
               holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in
               buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. 

               He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of
               control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires
               SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move:

               Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. 

               Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges
               surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --

               Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-
               flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize
               fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field
               and --

               SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar
               starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! 
               They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- 

               Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is
               holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas
               holding the world.  People run out, safe.

               ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.

                                   REED
                         JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!

               Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the
               wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. 

               Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The
               impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed.

                                   SUE
                         Can't...hold...on...

               Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands,
               vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! 

               He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he
               forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.

               Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body,
               RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without
               breaking.  He strains, agonizing.

                                   REED
                         Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         But all these people...

                                   REED
                         Now.

               Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting
               build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything.
               Johnny GRABS DOOM.

                                   THING
                             (quiet, smiling)
                         Flame on, kid.

               FLASH!  Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,
               which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed
               doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now.

                                   REED
                         Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
                         frustration --

                                   SUE
                             (looking at Doom)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and
               the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.

               Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER
               BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which
               WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). 

               Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.
               Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it
               in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the
               point that it's blinding.  People look away.

               Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the
               ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her
               knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As
               everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And --

               DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body
               GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look
               devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed.

                                   DOOM
                         Is that the best you can do...?  A
                         little heat...?

               Reed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head.

                                   REED
                         Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101:
                         what happens when you supercool hot
                         metal...?
                             (to Ben)
                         Ben...

                                   BEN
                         Got it, teach.

               He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.  The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben
               kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays
               toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...

               The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and
               SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!

                                   DOOM
                         No.

               Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING
               DOOM.  GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling
               metal.  DOOM screams.  His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE. 

               The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely
               obscuring Doom from view.  A beat.  The steam clears to
               reveal:

               DOOM.  A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of
               METAL.  Frozen forever.  Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The
               Fantastic Four -- exhale.  They stand as one, in roiling
               smoke.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Damn, I love this job.

               Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.

                                   BEN
                         Job, huh...?

               Will they accept their mantle?  Reed shrugs.

                                   REED
                         Well, we do have the suits...

               They give weary smiles.  A team.  Sue gets close to Reed.

                                   SUE
                         You know, about what we said up there,
                         I think maybe --

               THHM!  He KISSES HER.  His neck extending.  Strong, powerful. 
               He pulls back slightly, smiles at her.  A new strength in
               him.

                                   BEN
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

               Sue looks at Reed.  A long way from that conference room.

                                   SUE
                         Hilarious.

               As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding.  The sun
               rises around them.  The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn
               of a new day.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               INT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - BANQUET ROOM - DUSK

               Reed and Sue kiss on the deck of the Circle Line as it chugs
               around New York City.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Dude, that's still my sister.

               A PARTY IN PROGRESS.  Drinks, food, music.  We see in the
               crowd a familiar faces: O'HOOLIHAN (cast on his arm),
               bartender ERNIE, others.  JOHNNY and BEN stand behind Reed
               and Sue.

               Reed and Sue pull apart.  Reed turns to Ben, excited.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I've been crunching the numbers
                         on the machine.  I think if we can
                         rework the power settings...

                                   BEN
                         Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.

                                   ALICIA (O.S.)
                         That's my Benny.

               She hands Ben a big METAL MUG.  Ben takes the mug.  He
               CLINKS, but SHATTERS her glass.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         We're going to have to work on your
                         touch.

                                   BEN
                         I like the sound of that.

               Alicia gets close.  A soft smile.  Reed turns to Sue.

                                   REED
                         Sue, can I talk to you for a second?

               Reed leads her out.  Ben and Johnny swap a glance.

               EXT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - DECK - DUSK

               A romantic view of the city-scape.  Reed stands with Sue.

                                   REED
                         I found a broken gasket, from space --

                                   SUE
                         A gasket?  Reed, we're at a party.

               He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just
               about the size of......a RING.  Sue slows down.

                                   REED
                         If one of us were to wear it...

               She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret. 

               Reed looks her square in the eye.  Unflinching.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  What are you doing?

               Reed drops to his knees.  His head stays eye-level, while his
               body drops.  Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.

                                   REED
                         No more thinking, no more variables...
                         Sue Storm...will you...
                             (she's gone)
                         Sue?  Sue?  You there?

               Dead silence.  And then...

               THE RING DISAPPEARS.  SUE IS WEARING IT.

                                   SUE (V.O.)
                         Yes.

               Reed goes to kiss her.

                                   SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.

               INSIDE: the party applauds.  Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move
               through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.  As they go --

                                   BEN
                         No more cracks about how I look.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.
                             (weaving around bodies)
                         Clear the way, wide load coming
                         through.

               Ben glares, fists clenched.  Johnny smiles, mischievous, as
               they hit the balcony.  And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the
               air, blazing the NUMBER "FOUR" enclosed in a circle of flame
               (their future callsign), over the city skyline.  The crowd
               oohs and aahs.  Ben watches, unimpressed.

                                   BEN
                         Showoff.

               People drink, laugh, dance.  We slowly PULL BACK from the
               party, the boat, the city, and...CUT TO --

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               CLOSE ON: the MELTED FACE of DOOM.  He is placed in a wooden
               crate.  LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his
               cell.

               As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of
               ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.  Leonard's CELLPHONE goes
               STATICKY.  His eyes narrow.  Could it be...?  And --

               SLAM.  The door closes.  We can read the destination through
               stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.  And we pull back to reveal
               the box is on the deck of:

               A FREIGHTER SHIP.  The ship pulls away, steaming into the
               horizon, as we...

                                                       FADE OUT.



                                         THE END

                                      Revised Draft

                                         5/3/2004

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a 
               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

               Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its 
               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES 
               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching 
               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, 
               weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut 
               and naive).

               Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth 
               before them.

                                     CHIEF
                         This is it.

                                     LANKY
                         Why did it have to be these caves...

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Is something wrong?

                                     LANKY
                              (to College Boy)
                         Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.

               Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.

               The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT." 

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's get that first barrel.

               The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS 
               bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.

               INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

               College Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first 
               barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         What's with the awkward silence?

                                     LANKY
                         You don't know?

               College Boy shakes his head "no" and they set the cart down.

                                     CHIEF
                         Last winter, a man kidnapped a little 
                         girl and holed up in one of these 
                         caves. The cops had him pinned down 
                         and began to move in. This guy started 
                         shooting... but he wasn't aiming at 
                         the officers...
                              (getting closer)
                         ...he was firing at something inside.

               College Boy is rapt.

                                     CHIEF
                         When the dust cleared, all they found 
                         was the little girl's shoes.
                              (beat)
                         With the feet still in 'em.

               Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Ahh!!!

               Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The 
               two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Assholes.

                                     CHIEF
                         Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself 
                         when my boss pulled that one on me.

                                     LANKY
                         I went well beyond nearly.

               Then, a sound. All eyes turn.

                                     CHIEF
                         What was that?

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Once was plenty, fellas.

                                     CHIEF
                         Shhhh...

               As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe.

               Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A 
               group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, 
               CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.

               MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched 
               a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around 
               her neck. She charges towards Chief.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Stop it right there! You will not 
                         rape Mother Nature one more day!

               Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

               In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.

                                     HIPPIE GROUP
                         Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't 
                         dump in her any-more/Mother Nature 
                         is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-
                         more...

               A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films 
               the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.  

                                     CHIEF
                         Take it easy! We have a permit!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (handing a document)
                         And we have an injunction from the 
                         State to prevent any dumping in these 
                         caverns! This is virgin land! The 
                         aqueducts in these caves bring 
                         drinking water to our families, and 
                         its piping provides drainage for our 
                         farms that enrich this barren land! 
                         And it won't be tainted by waste of 
                         any kind! Not now! Not ever!

               Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Fine, just back off!

               He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's roll... Now-now-now!

               Backing away, looking to Mean Green.

                                     CHIEF
                         How do you guys always know where 
                         we're going?

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (with a smirk)
                         I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!

               Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Score one for the green team!!!

               The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a 
               tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in 
               the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their 
               truck and peel away.

                                     BEARDED CAMERAMAN
                         Hey, man, that was righteous, but I 
                         need a shot with the sign up.

               At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves 
               to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         We saved you today, ol' gal.

               Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach 
               in the rock wall.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh, fuck!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Sister, why do you always swing for 
                         the fences?

                                     FUZZY
                              (eyeing breach)
                         It's okay, but I... I think I see 
                         something in there... something shiny.

               Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The 
               rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh my, it looks like diamonds!

               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. 
               Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.

               Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

               Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles 
               forward.

               Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.

               One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

               Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

               Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Give me the keys!!!

               Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing 
               both his arms.

               Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She 
               HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.

               Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she 
               BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.

               She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her 
               fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. 
               She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

               Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. 
               The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. 
               As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music 
               emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles.

               A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle 
               on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER 
               TOY HAS TITS."

               A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from 
               the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him.

               The rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup 
               trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes 
               through the front entrance --

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well 
               over six foot five with frazzled black hair and olive skin.

               Talking with a thick Greek accent, he pleads into a pay phone.

               Further into the bar, a man in a wheelchair loads a quarter 
               into an old jukebox, but he is instantly pushed away by Bozo.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Beer Guy (kinda handsome... just kinda) sets a keg of beer 
               behind the bar. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BEER GUY 
               AGE: 32 
               OCCUPATION: BEER GUY/PART-TIME HOST AT RED LOBSTER 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WIMPS AND DORKS ARE THE FIRST TO GO... HE'S 
               BOTH

               He talks with BARTENDER (thinning hair, chiseled face, big 
               earring) who preps a drink.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I mean, we'd been together for so 
                         long and then... bang! She drops me. 
                         Since then, it's been like a damn 
                         country song: she's gone, the car's 
                         repossessed, and a father figure 
                         made a pass at me. I'm not saying I 
                         ever had it. But I have definitely 
                         lost it.
                              (beat)
                         Now I haul this swill from armpit to 
                         armpit. I used to be a model for 
                         Christ's sake.

               Coach has been eavesdropping on Beer Guy and approaches.

                         JC Penny. Spring wear.

               Beer Guy then mimics throwing a sport coat over his shoulder 
               and delivering his "model" cheese smile.

                                     COACH
                         You know, Chach, catching you at 
                         this low point is pure serendipity.

                         Why is that?

                                     COACH
                         Because I take the rubble of man and 
                         build superstars. In my briefcase 
                         here is a doorway to a self-help 
                         sensation. Give me a minute, because 
                         I'd like to buy you a drink and change 
                         your life forever. I have a brochure --

                                     BARTENDER
                         Save it. We don't deal in pamphlets 
                         'round here. We stick to chemistry. 
                         And his drinks are on me.

               Bartender puts a shot in front of Beer Guy. Behind him, a 
               mounted DEER HEAD is prominently displayed. Freeze on him.

               With Coach stumped, Bartender turns to Beer Guy.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Was that the last keg?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Yup, one keg of Beast for the 
                         basement, then the truck's dry.

                                     BARTENDER
                         If you're stayin', move the truck, 
                         boss gets pissed about you using 
                         primo parking.

               Beer Guy downs his shot and hoists the lone keg into the 
               waiting keg elevator.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Right, 'cause this joint's hopping.

               He hits a button and the keg slowly lowers to the basement.

               A glass of beer slides down the bar. A hand GRABS it and 
               puts it on a tray. The woman is pretty though haggard, stained 
               apron and dirty blond hair. Freeze on her.

               Tuffy moves to a table where ADULTERER (bushy mustache, 
               sweater vest, dress shirt) sits with TRAMPY (designer glasses,

               GENITALS: SHAVED 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WORSE THAN TRAMPY

               Adulterer reaches into his pocket to pay the tab, but he 
               inadvertently pulls out his hidden WEDDING RING.

                                     TRAMPY
                         That sounds like bullshit! I could 
                         be an assistant manager at The Lake 
                         Arrowhead Casino for knowing the 
                         fuckin' alphabet to G! I'll be twenty 
                         in three months...

               The damning wedding band falls and bounces. As it rolls, 
               Tuffy, Trampy and Adulterer watch.

               The ring stops, standing still on its side.

               Trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver.

               Adulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Just bring the whole bottle.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy walks back over to the bar adding Adulterer's cash to 
               a fat roll of money. BELLE (stringy blond hair, cute face, 
               brand-spanking new employee) looks up with surprise.

               Freeze on her.

               NAME: BELLE 
               AGE: 21 
               OCCUPATION: WAITRESS

               LIFE EXPECTANCY: SAME ODDS AS PLAYING BELLE IN STAGE VERSION 
               OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"

                                     BELLE
                         If I could made that kind of money, 
                         I'd be in Hollywood next week.

               Boss Man walks by and nods to Tuffy, making his way to the 
               rickety side-staircase to the SECOND FLOOR. Tuffy grinds her 
               teeth and moves to the staircase.

                                     TUFFY
                         'Round here, there are ways.

               Boss Man winks at Belle. Pure sleaze.

               Freeze on him.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool 
               table. Edgy Cat sinks the eighth shot of a NINE BALL game.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That cash is gonna look much better 
                         in my pocket.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: mounted head)
                         Ya know, that deer only looks scared 
                         when you're in the room.

               Para rolls up behind Edgy.

                                     PARA
                         Excuse me, please.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Jesus!

               Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the 
               WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline.

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Para's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which 
               Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's all she wrote...

               SMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball 
               ricochets away as intended.

               Para flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue 
               ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         What?!

                                     BOZO
                         Ohhh, now that's a rough one.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's motherfuckin' impossible!

                                     BOZO
                              (crude Oriental accent)
                         Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go 
                         again?

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Goddamn it! NO!

                                     BOZO
                         Oh, come on. Crape Diem!

               Bozo takes the cash from the table. Edgy Cat sulks away 
               cursing to himself and moves to the bar.

               Roadie looks on, sipping a beer.

               Freeze on Roadie.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo HITS the table of GRANDPA (elderly, white hair, bushy 
               white mustache) and GRANDMA (curly white hair, glasses).

               Freeze on them.

                         Get outta here.

                                     BOZO
                              (mocking)
                         What's that? Wha'cha say? Huh?
                              (to Grandma)
                         How much for the whole night, Grandma?

                                     GRANDMA
                         You should be so lucky.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (re: his fists)
                         This one will stun ya, but this one 
                         will put ya to sleep.

                                     BOZO
                         Whoa!

               Bozo approaches OLD VET (52, long hair with bandanna, dirty 
               beard) HARLEY MOM, (45, bruiser, grizzled, tough as a saddle) 
               and DRUNK GUY at the bar. The sad trio toss peanut shells 
               into three nearby tall, fat peanut barrels.

                                     BOZO
                         You boys wanna try your luck at the 
                         loot?

               Harley mom is offended. Not a word from the others.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on, I'll even throw with my 
                         left hand.

               He turns in disappointment.

                                     BOZO
                         Nothin' but a bunch of butts and 
                         pussies in here!

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a tray full of drinks behind the bar.

                                     BELLE
                         Shit! Shit! Shit!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Don't sweat it, just clean it up 
                         before he's done.

               He points up to the second floor.

               INT. BAR -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy's son CODY (7, innocent, cute) sits on the floor 
               watching TV. Freeze on him.

                         Keep these on, sweetheart.

                         Mommy, I want Nemo.

                                     TUFFY
                         Mommy's working on it.

               Tuffy kisses him and then moves to an adjacent room.

               ADJACENT ROOM

               Tuffy enters the room and takes off her blouse exposing her 
               breasts. She pulls up her skirt and bends over a bedpost.

                                     TUFFY
                         Let's get this over with.

               Boss Man walks up naked, except for red cowboy boots.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo walks to the middle of the room.

                                     BOZO
                         I got two hundred bucks says none of 
                         you can beat me!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey! Get quiet or get out.

                         Gimme some ACTION --

               BOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO 
               (30s, rugged alpha man built to kick ass).

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks --

               MUSIC CUTS OUT

               Hero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue 
               denim and holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and GUNNY SACK.

               He SLAMS the double doors shut and props a chair against the 
               handles, securing them.

                                     HERO
                         Unless you people want to die you'll 
                         do what I say and you'll do it fast!

               Bartender cocks his SHOTGUN.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You hold it right there, mister.

                                     HERO
                         A storm of hell's coming down on 
                         this place any minute!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Drop the canon!

               Hero puts down the shotgun and moves towards Bartender.

                                     HERO
                         I'm not armed now, just hear me out.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll drop you and not even think 
                         about it!

                                     HERO
                         Let me explain!

                                     BARTENDER
                         You got one second to --

               Hero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPA BEAST HEAD 
               from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see.

                                     HERO
                         Take a good look and listen to me! 
                         There's at least a four of these 
                         things out there!

               Grandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full 
               of jagged, ivory white teeth. It is like an albino jackal 
               head with spiked hair.

                                     HERO
                         I saw one of them tear up five men 
                         like they were corn on the cob!
                              (off silence, shock)
                         I don't know what they are. I don't 
                         know where they came from. All I do 
                         know is that these fuckers are fast, 
                         nasty, and hungry.

               The bar stares at him, slack-jawed.

                                     HERO
                         And they can fly. Not to mention 
                         they got claws like Ginsu knifes and 
                         more teeth than a chainsaw.

               The Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly. Fast as a snake, 
               Hero GRABS it. He notices the engraving, "THE JUDGE."

                                     HERO
                         They're like goddamn blood hungry 
                         biker tattoos come to life. They're 
                         clocking us. Right now. And we have 
                         to lock this bar down!
                              (moving around)
                         That means doors, windows, drains, 
                         and basements. We have to do it fast!

               Hero looks out the lone front window.

                                     HERO
                              (looks to Belle)
                         You! Get on that phone. Call the 
                         cops, National Guard, townies, whoever 
                         kicks ass and get 'em out here.

               Belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar.

                                     HERO
                         Any questions?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who are you?

                                     HERO
                         I'm the hero --

               CRASH! A white Beast arms BURSTS through the window and SPLITS 
               Hero right down the middle. The Judge FIRES into the ceiling --

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as 
               he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS.

               MAIN BAR

               Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window.

               Blood sprays. Rapid chomping. CRASH! The double doors are 
               kicked open, splintering the propped up chair.

               HEROINE (Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly 
               hot) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks 
               up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides 
               the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors, 
               securing them.

               BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside 
               sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor.

               She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table 
               attempting to hoist it over the now open window.

                                     HEROINE
                         HELP ME! SOMEBODY!

               Old Vet and Harley Mom rush to Heroine's aid. They raise the 
               table to cover the gaping hole. Heroine looks outside.

                                     HEROINE
                         GET DOWN!

               A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face.

               The table falls, pinning Heroine.

               JUNIOR BEAST enters. He's small and too fast to see well.

               He SWIPES the heads off Old Vet and Harley Mom. Bartender 
               grabs The Judge, but he's SCRATCHED down the back.

               Junior Beast rips out the pay phone. Knocks over the TV.

               Yanks out half of Trampy's hair.

               Edgy Cat CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         I got you!

               Edgy Cat misses. Junior Beast sends him FLYING into a wall.

               BLAM! BLAM! Bartender FIRES The Judge at the creature hitting 
               lights instead. An errant shot destroys Edgy Cat's face.

               Para covers as Junior Beast RIPS the back of his wheelchair.

               Roadie WHACKS Junior Beast with a chair. Stunned, it flies 
               across the room, landing in a metal ICE COOLER.

               Bozo SLAMS it closed, capturing Junior Beast.

                                     BOZO
                         Got 'cha!

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Shadows of THREE SHRIEKING BEASTS close in on the window...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bartender runs across the bar and SLAMS shut the thick wood 
               shutters. The Beasts HIT, cracking the middle.

               Roadie power lifts the table with Heroine and braces it 
               against the window for reinforcement, but a FURRY ARM busts 
               through and grabs the other half of Hero.

                                     HEROINE
                         Goddamn you!

               Blood starts to SPRAY from outside as the rest of Hero is 
               being devoured through the smallish hole.

               Heroine works a GOLD RING off of Hero's ring finger. The 
               feeding MOMMA BEAST'S head breaks in through the hole. It 
               grabs Heroine's left forearm.

               Bartender aims The Judge at the Beast...

                                     ROADIE
                         You'll hit her!

               Roadie KNOCKS The Judge up -- BLAM!

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's shotgun blast blows off another toe on Boss Man's 
               RIGHT FOOT. He cries out in agony. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine spins and buries a splintered piece of the broken 
               chair into the ATTACKING MOMMA BEAST'S RIGHT EYE. The Beast 
               SCREECHES and jerks back, dragging the rest of Hero outside.

               Heroine clutches the ring. Shrieks and flapping wings are 
               heard outside. They dissipate. A moment of calm.

               Belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone.

               The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding 
               spaces in various states of shock. Junior Beast has 
               momentarily stopped moving. Bozo secures the lid with a nearby 
               PADLOCK.

                                     BOZO
                         What the FUCK was that?

               Wild-eyed and with a trembling hand, Heroine pours herself a 
               shot from the bar. She downs it and takes a long breath.

                                     HEROINE
                         The jungle has a new king.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is it clear?!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Yeah.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is there a gun pointing at you?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Nah, I got the gun.

               Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His 
               foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? 
                         Who did it!?

               Belle and Bartender move to his aid.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin' 
                         shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (motioning to Heroine)
                         Her fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         He's dead.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?
                              (noticing destruction)
                         What the hell happened down here?!

               Boss Man looks to Bozo.

                                     BOZO
                         I didn't do it! It was fuckin' 
                         monsters, asshole!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Jesus Christ on the cross... someone 
                         make sense.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy. We're surrounded by something 
                         the likes none of you have ever seen 
                         before. Some kind of animals. Real 
                         fast, volatile, predators. One went 
                         through three of your patrons like 
                         nothing.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         So, your dead hubby shot me twice, 
                         three of my customers have been eaten, 
                         and there are angry creatures outside?

                                     HEROINE
                         He only shot you once.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Huh?

                                     HEROINE
                              (re: Bartender)
                         He shot you the other time.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It was an accident. Sorry.

               Boss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA 
               BEAST'S HEAD on the bar.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Look at it!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fan-fuckin-tastic.

                                     TUFFY
                         My god... what is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         That's one piece of four problems.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Please elaborate.

                                     HEROINE
                         That head over there, that's the 
                         oldest of the bunch, looked like the 
                         Grandpa. We caught the little one, 
                         Junior, in the cooler there. As we've 
                         seen, what he lacks in size he more 
                         than makes up for in speed.

                                     BARTENDER
                         And the rest of 'em?

                                     HEROINE
                         Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are 
                         still outside.

               NOTE: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a slight glimpse 
               of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.

                                     HEROINE
                         The next one is taller, but all out 
                         of proportion. Like a "teen beast."

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               TEEN BEAST has a big head and awkward body. He clumsily moves 
               and seems uncomfortable in his own skin.

                                     HEROINE (V.O.)
                         He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly 
                         just the same.

               INT. BAR FRONT -- NIGHT

               Heroine tends to her scratched arm.

                                     HEROINE
                         I just took the eye out of the mother. 
                         She calculates, guiding the attacks.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than 
               Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL 
               GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her 
               stabbed right eye and SCREECHES.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine taps her right eye.

                                     HEROINE
                         If you are face to face with her, 
                         dive left.

                         Father. The biggest, the strongest...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               A blur of muscles, bloody fur, and teeth.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The entire bar stares at Heroine with their mouths agape.

                                     HEROINE
                         No sign of any weaknesses. No sign 
                         at all. He's an eating machine.

                                     COACH
                         Of all the friggin' bars to be stuck 
                         in.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's not it. Four are here, but 
                         there's three others... which I can't 
                         account for.

               Heroine eyes the room.

                                     HEROINE
                         We need to lock this place down. Is 
                         everyone in this room?

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh my god! My son! My SON!

               Tuffy races toward the staircase to the SECOND FLOOR.

                                     HEROINE
                         Wait!

               Tuffy is halfway up the stairs.

                                     TUFFY
                         Cody! Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming!

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop her!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved. 

                                     CODY
                         Mommy --

               Tuffy pulls Cody into her arms. Heroine and Bartender halt 
               to guard the doorway. Heroine spots a SMALL PORTAL WINDOW.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? 
                         Mommy is never gonna let you go!

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's lock off this room.

                                     TUFFY
                              (moving to exit)
                         Never, ever, never. Never, ever, 
                         never, baby. I love you --

               SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS 
               Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING 
               ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere.

                                     TUFFY
                         NOOOOOOOO!

               Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa 
               Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window.

               Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast 
               projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender.

               Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the 
               wood shutters closed.

               Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, 
               to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's 
               bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.

                                     HEROINE
                         Damn it.

               MAIN BAR

               Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Oh god...

               He hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of 
               the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what 
               happened. The horror hits home.

               Heroine eyes the destroyed phone.

                                     COACH
                              (to Tuffy)
                         Are you --

               Heroine puts a hand up to silence Coach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Just let her be... please.
                              (beat)
                         Is that the only phone?

               Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic 
               and wires.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The back phone is wrecked, too.

               Trampy's eyes light up and she digs through her purse.

                                     BELLE
                         This is really happening. I can't 
                         believe this is really happening.

               Grandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats.

                                     GRANDPA
                         What'd you say?

                                     GRANDMA
                         I didn't say anything.

               Bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa 
               Beast head at the end of the bar.

               Para is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair.

               Belle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming 
               from the wheelchair's back rest.

                                     PARA
                         Thank you, but I don't need any help --

                                     BELLE
                         What's this? A power magnet or 
                         something?

                                     PARA
                         No. It's nothing.

               Belle puts together his scam with a smirk.

                                     BELLE
                         I didn't peg you for a con man.

                                     PARA
                         Hey, it pays more than the couch.

                                     BELLE
                         Lots of stuff around here does.

               Trampy pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Here!

               The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Hey!

                                     ADULTERER
                         Back off!

               Beer Guy walks from behind the bar.

                                     BEER GUY
                         So, what now? Did those things leave?

                                     BOZO
                         Why don't you go check it out?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Fuck no.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (into cell phone)
                         I have a signal! I have -- Diane? 
                         Diane listen to me... get the kids 
                         and get in the basement... do it 
                         right now...

               Trampy stares with grief in her eyes.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'll explain later. Not now! I'm at 
                         a bar... look... shut up! JUST SHUT 
                         UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT, 
                         DIANE! Diane! Diane?... Hello? Damn 
                         it! I lost the signal!

               Adulterer looks at the phone a bit dazed.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get 
                         outta here! I gotta go! My wife... 
                         See my wife is alone... She could be 
                         in trouble. I GOTTA GO!

               He moves towards the front door. Heroine moves into his path.

                                     HEROINE
                         I wouldn't do that.

               Adulterer, violently grabs Heroine to shove her away.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Fuck you, bitch!

               Heroine nails Adulterer with THREE HITS to the chin, throat 
               and chest, flipping him to the floor. She pulls a KNIFE from 
               her belt buckle and has it under Adulterer's chin.

                                     HEROINE
                         You can risk your life, but not mine! 
                         My daughter's no more than twenty 
                         miles from here waiting for me. I 
                         have just as much reason to leave 
                         this place as you do. But I also 
                         know that if they're here, then 
                         they're not there yet.

               Adulterer squirms.

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Get the fuck off...

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me!?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes!

                                     HEROINE
                         Now pull that tough boy shit again 
                         and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!

               Adulterer nods obediently. Heroine removes the knife from 
               his neck and plants it back into her buckle.

                                     ADULTERER
                         You can't keep me here. This is 
                         bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is 
                         fucking BULLSHIT!

                                     HEROINE
                         We can't risk letting them in.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (trembling, pissed)
                         Right.

               Adulterer takes his seat. He looks over at the half bald 
               Trampy. She looks at him, hurt.

               At the bar, Bozo puts the TV back into place, he jiggles 
               with some wires in the back, bringing back the picture.

                                     BOZO
                         Anything?

                                     PARA
                         Yeah, you got it.

               The bar takes notice. Trampy, cell phone in hand, paws through 
               a phone book as she watches the broadcast.

                                     BELLE
                         See! This has to be isolated. That's 
                         a local broadcast.

               ON TV: The Newscaster reads the teleprompter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         And now, we head to our man on the 
                         scene with a live look at tomorrow's 
                         event in Red Mountain.

               Heroine eagerly looks on, moving closer to the TV.

                                     HEROINE
                         My daughter's in Red Mountain.

               ON TV: There is an awkward pause from the Newscaster. The 
               broadcast doesn't cut to the reporter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Can you hear us? Apparently we're 
                         having some technical difficulties...

               Heroine sinks in her skin.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Oh, there we go!

               ON TV: A REPORTER, in an even worse suit, stands in a field 
               with several people looking through telescopes.

                                     REPORTER
                         That's right, the crowds are lining 
                         up early to witness tomorrow's 
                         meteorological phenomenon.

               Heroine sighs a gust of relief.

                                     REPORTER
                         But always remember, don't look 
                         straight into the sun because a 
                         special filter is needed to avoid 
                         damaging your cornea.

               The Reporter beams.

                                     REPORTER
                         And we're all looking forward to it 
                         tomorrow. Back to you.

               In the studio, the Newscaster smirks.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Thank you. And in other news...

               ON TV: the Newscaster continues his routine.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         ...it has been reported that the 
                         power outage --

               A Beast arm REACHES in and TEARS off Newscaster's jaw. The 
               bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays. ZAP! The broadcast 
               cuts out, turning to static.

               Trampy screams and DROPS the cell, SHATTERING on impact.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Oh no! Oh fucking no!

               Heroine, tense, quells the rising panic.

                                     HEROINE
                         Keep it together! I came from the 
                         east. That studio is south of here. 
                         For all we know, north and west are 
                         okay.

                         An associate of mine was coming in 
                         from the north, ain't heard a word 
                         from him in hours.

                                     HEROINE
                         So, that leaves the west.

               Tuffy looks up from a booth, clearing her throat.

                                     TUFFY
                         And Red Mountain. Your daughter.

               Heroine looks over, making eye contact.

                                     HEROINE
                         Right.

                                     BEER GUY
                         This is goddamn depressing.

               At the door, Heroine slides a thick metal pole through the 
               double door handles and takes out the Rust Red shotgun.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I've got some tools and extra planks 
                         in the kitchen, if we're on the same 
                         page here.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's work.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               The last board is hammered into place as the survivors back 
               away from the now re-enforced bar.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We'll it ain't pretty...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         But its got teeth.

               BAM-BAM-BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler.

                                     BOZO
                         I think it's hungry again.

                                     HEROINE
                         We have to kill it.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         Can you help?

               Boss Man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his .38. Junior 
               Beast goes wild, trying to get out.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fire in the hole!

               Bullets rip through the cooler. Junior squeals. More shots.

               Casings hit the ground. Smoke rises. Bozo leans in.

                                     BOZO
                         I think we got --

               RAH! A tiny white arm fires out from the cooler GRABBING 
               Bozo's leg. Bozo yelps.

               Moving quick, Tuffy grabs The Judge from Bartender and shoves 
               the barrel into a hole.

               BLAM! Guts splatter. Bozo falls back unscathed. He catches 
               his breath and looks to Tuffy. She is born again, seething.

                                     TUFFY
                         You're welcome.

               She hands the shotgun back to Bartender.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Jesus, it took all that? All those 
                         bullets? How can we possibly fight 
                         off the others?

                                     HEROINE
                         Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears 
                         and mouth. From what I've seen, it's 
                         their only weakness.

                                     ROADIE
                              (looking at the corpse)
                         Looks like they're soft on the inside 
                         like any other animal. Trick is to 
                         get in there and do the damage.

                                     BELLE
                         Maybe we don't have to fight them.

                                     BOZO
                         Right, let's just call 'em names.

               Coach steps forward, poised to make the sale.

                                     COACH
                         Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have 
                         your attention.

               The bar skeptically eyes the large, sweaty Greek man.

                                     COACH
                         We have to think outside the box 
                         here. We don't need to fight them, 
                         we need to scare them. Scare them 
                         right back. This is a species stand-
                         off. We just need to show them we're 
                         not vulnerable. That we're formidable.

                                     ADULTERER
                         How?

                                     COACH
                         I need a stick.

               Bartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out 
               Junior Beast with salad tongs. It falls to the floor with a 
               SPLAT. Coach grabs a splintered broomstick.

                                     COACH
                         Stand back.

               He buries the broomstick into Junior's side and carries the 
               limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall.

                                     COACH
                         Let's get that board down.

               Roadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole. 

                                     HEROINE
                         What are you doing?

               Coach shoves Junior's mangled body through to the outside.

                                     COACH
                         Showing superiority. The scent of 
                         their dead may drive them away.

               The whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the Beast 
               family will react. They look through SMALL HOLES, barely 
               able to see anything.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I don't see them.

                                     COACH
                         Come on. Come onnnnnn.

                                     BELLE
                         Is there a call, or something?

                                     BOZO
                         See that you monkey fucks! That's 
                         what you get when you mess with us! 
                         Woman or man, I don't give a fuck! 
                         Shit don't make me gay because you'll 
                         be sucking my dick!

               Bozo's insult hangs in the air.

                                     PARA
                         Sweet...

               P.O.V - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               WHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the handmade pike.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Coach jerks back. The startled group tries to focus, but 
               it's too dark outside. With the moon as the only light, Father 
               Beast can barely be made out cradling his dead child.

               Silhouettes of the other family members slowly approach 
               Junior. Papa Beast is gentle and it's almost endearing.

                                     BEER GUY
                         It's working. I think it's working.

                                     COACH
                         You see? What I tell you?

               The whole group starts to ease. Then... Papa Beast HOLLERS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL. The group jumps back, 
               covering their ears. Then, something really odd happens.  
               Momma tosses Junior in the air, opens her wide jaws and 
               SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Adulterer's eyes widen.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Good christ! They're cannibals!

                                     COACH
                         Oh dear...

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast moves behind Momma Beast and grabs hold of her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               A steady "thud-thud-thud" rhythm vibrates the bar. Grandpa's 
               drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats. The 
               group maneuvers to get a better look.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Oh... my... god.

                                     PARA
                         What are they doing now?

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Yes, Momma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

                                     BOZO
                         Dude, they're humpin'!

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts 
               all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and 
               she squats. POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum 
               cleaner drops from her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Trampy VOMITS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               The slimy object SPLITS in half. The two halves spring 
               appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN SISTER BEASTS 
               have been born.

               Papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The 
               Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine's eyes bulge.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get back!

               SLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front.

               Roadie shoves that board back over the hole. Beer Guy is 
               holding back the still heaving Trampy's hair.

                                     BOZO
                         Any more ideas, Animal Planet?

                                     COACH
                         I-I-I was just being proactive...

                                     BEER GUY
                              (to Bozo)
                         Hey, you weren't helpin'!

                                     BOZO
                         Go douche.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What the hell now?

                                     ADULTERER
                         We're stuck in here. That's what.

               Bozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair.

               Roadie nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hey, Miss?

               Heroine turns.

                                     ROADIE
                         If you don't mind me asking, how did 
                         you run into these things?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         More importantly, how did you run 
                         away from these things?

                                     HEROINE
                         Well, it all started about forty 
                         hours ago...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- EVENING

               The orange sun melts into the horizon.

               INT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero and his overweight friend TUBBS (35, hard living career 
               farm hand) laugh at a TV show while Heroine paces on the 
               telephone in the background.

                                     HEROINE
                              (into phone)
                         So, how is staying with Grandma 
                         working out? Ya know, if you stare 
                         into her glasses, you can see what 
                         cards she is holding. But I didn't 
                         tell you that.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- CONTINUOUS

               There's a home on the horizon with a big barn next to it.

               Shrieking and flapping grows in the distance.

               INT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine starts to peek out of the window.

                                     HEROINE
                         Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night, 
                         okay baby?

               The phone cuts out.

                                     HEROINE
                         Hello? Charlie?

               Heroine and Hero look at each other with concern. Hero looks 
               out the window.

                                     HERO
                         Holy mother of...

               Heroine has the group mesmerized.

                         We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. 
                         Then it was just listening. We heard 
                         those things destroy an entire heard 
                         of livestock. They just kept coming. 
                         Closer and closer, consuming anything 
                         in the way. Slashing, feeding and 
                         licking the bones clean. Just when 
                         we said our prayers, the first ray 
                         of sun hit the house...

               EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING

               PLOP! A HORSE'S HEAD falls as Heroine and her companions 
               peek out from the damaged cellar door.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         That first beam of sunlight drove 
                         'em away. Somewhere. We called who 
                         we could and then decided to run for 
                         it. We didn't see a soul the whole 
                         drive out. When the tank went dry, 
                         we came upon a gas station to refill.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- LATE DAY

               The sun is falling into the horizon. The traveler's CAMARO 
               pulls into a small gas station

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine goes up to the service window with Tubbs and looks 
               inside. Nobody. There is a slight BUZZING from inside.

               Hero hollers from the fuel pump by the car.

                                     HERO
                         What's goin' on? The pumps are off.

                                     TUBBS
                         There's nobody here --

               She follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room. There 
               is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a STATION 
               ATTENDANT'S gutted torso.

                                     HEROINE
                         They've been here!

                         Turn on the pump!

               Glass shatters as Heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps.

                         We had no time. All we knew was the 
                         sun was dropping and we had to get 
                         enough fuel to make it through the 
                         night at 90 miles per hour...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

               Hero fills their Camaro.

                                     HERO
                         Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck 
                         it down.

               INT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tubbs hastily grabs food and drinks, ignoring 
               the cash register completely. The sun is setting.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero turns as a shrill HISSING comes from the shadows...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         It happened fast...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

               Heroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop.

                                     HERO
                         Move it!

               Heroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts.

               Their loot hits the pavement as they run.

                                     HERO
                         Get in the car, baby.

               Hero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the 
               back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat.

               Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the 
               sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas 
               pool. Something rises in the gas station.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                         just for a second.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- SUNSET

               Three lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows.

                                     HERO
                         Roll!

               Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the 
               station becomes a FIREBALL.

               INT. CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS

                         Close the roof!

               Hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof 
               as STRIPPED COUSIN BEAST lands on top of the car...

                                     HERO
                         Shit!

               Stripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window, 
               reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel.

               The car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into 
               darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road.

                                     HERO
                         We made it!

               Hero reaches back to give a "five" to Tubbs. Tubbs doesn't 
               respond. Heroine is the first to see Tubbs' quivering, 
               HEADLESS body in the back seat.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine stands near Grandpa Beast's head.

                                     HEROINE
                         It must have smelled the blood or 
                         something. We buried the body and 
                         got back on the main road when...

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               BOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro.

               Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly 
               as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield.

                                     HERO
                         Break!

               Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back, 
               holding onto the grill.

                                     HERO
                         Go! Go! Go!

               Grandpa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as 
               sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel.

                                     HERO

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               The car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast.

               His head FIRES through the windshield, landing on Heroine's 
               lap. Its snake-like tongue lashes out at Heroine's crotch.

                         to think. We just moved. He didn't 
                         leave me. He just ran.

                         The first order of business is gettin' 
                         a big fuckin' tampon in that cave!

                                     PARA
                         Nope, that wouldn't do it.

               FROM ADULTERER'S P.O.V. - He peeks out the hole and sees 
               nothing but the dark night. Bartender eyes him.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I wouldn't do that.

                                     BOZO
                         They're probably on to the next buffet 
                         by now. There's a retirement home up 
                         the road, they'd be easy pickings.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Adulterer)
                         Careful.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --

               BOINK! Papa Beast's claw POKES into his eye. Adulterer JERKS 
               away holding his blood squirting eye socket.

               FROM OUTSIDE

               P.O.V. - The eye sees its owner stumble back and fall to 
               the floor holding his face.

               INSIDE

               Coach and Trampy move to help Adulterer.

               FROM OUTSIDE

               The eyeball fires into Papa's drooling mega-mouth. SLURP!

               INSIDE

               BASH! A Beast arm BURSTS through the side wall and SNAGS 
               Coach's pants and boxers. He screams and lunges forward. He 
               is BOTTOMLESS.

                                     HEROINE
                         Everyone stay in the middle of the 
                         room! Off the walls! NOW!

               Everyone obeys her command to get in the middle of the room.

               Belle hands Coach a little menu to cover himself with.

                                     HEROINE
                         Now, does everyone agree that they 
                         are still out there?

               The group nods.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Bozo)
                         'Eh, Chief?

                                     BOZO
                         ...Duh.

               Trampy holds Adulterer's wounded head.

                                     TRAMPY
                         He's out cold.

                                     BELLE
                         I know some first aid if we have a 
                         kit. Do we?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         In the kitchen, under the sink.

                                     HEROINE
                         No one goes anywhere alone. Least of 
                         all, unarmed.

                                     TUFFY
                              (to Coach)
                         There's some sweats in my bag behind 
                         the bar.

                                     COACH
                         Thanks.

               Coach heads to the bar. Roadie moves to the map near Para.

                                     ROADIE
                         You're a clever man.
                              (re: Bozo)
                         Why do you take shit from him?

                                     PARA
                         Yeah, he's an ass, but he's my 
                         brother. Que sera-sera.

                                     ROADIE
                         Your brother, huh?

                                     PARA
                         Yep.

                                     ROADIE
                         Same parents?

                                     PARA
                         Look man, I read books. He reads 
                         bumper stickers.

               Roadie nods. Heroine jerks a bottle of booze from Beer Guy 
               and tosses it out.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright, we need to stay alert and 
                         for everyone to take a role.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         You gotta have some guns or weapons 
                         around here.

               Boss Man, pale and morphine pumped, sits at a table with his 
               foot raised.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I got my .38 here. That's six shots 
                         and two refills. Downstairs, I have 
                         locker with a sawed-off and some 
                         gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes 
                         of shells.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I got shells, too. Box and a half 
                         tops. Machete behind the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Okay, well that's something.

                                     ROADIE
                         So we've got guns, kitchen knives, 
                         pipes, fire and sticks.

               Beer Guy scans the stocked bar wall.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I might be able to do something with 
                         the bottles.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You're gonna need a whole lot more 
                         than that to get outta here alive.

               The crowd turns to face Grandpa and his wife.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh, now you have something to say?

               Grandpa holds on to Grandma's hand as he speaks.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You young'uns worry about weapons, 
                         I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh? And what's that?

                                     GRANDPA
                         Sit still, look less like a meal.

                                     BOZO
                         That's for bears and sharks, chunky 
                         chew.

               The group looks back to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright, what else do we have? Can 
                         we somehow contact the outside world?

               Trampy pensively stays on her fractured phone.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I can't get anybody. I don't even 
                         know if I have a signal anymore.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I have a CB in my truck, we could 
                         get some help out here.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who the hell would you call?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Anyone.

                                     BOZO
                         Do you drive a short beer bus or 
                         something? You go out there, you get 
                         eaten. You stay in here, you get 
                         eaten. Anyone comes to help, they 
                         get eaten. Don't you see a pattern 
                         here, Spuds Makenzie?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Then I guess we should just give up.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy)
                         Believe me, I'd love to save the day 
                         and get some heroic snatch, but it's 
                         not in the cards, partner.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         You said you had a short wave radio.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Where?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Upstairs.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Go for it. It's by the far wall. 
                         Channel 9 is the emergency frequency.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. I'm heading to the basement 
                         for supplies.
                              (to Bozo)
                         And you're going upstairs.

               Bozo blinks. A little taken aback.

                                     BOZO
                         Let's not get carried away...

                                     HEROINE
                         Step up, Chief.

                                     BOZO
                         So that's how it is?
                              (hands out)
                         Fine! Shotgun, please.

               Bartender hands him The Judge.

                                     BOZO
                              (to Bartender)
                         You're coming with, portly. 'Cause 
                         if I'm attacked, I want a fat man 
                         close by.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll wait by the door.

                                     BOZO
                         Now who else is comin'?

               No one budges.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (rising from his seat)
                         I'll go with ya.

                                     BOZO
                         What are you gonna do? Throw your 
                         teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

               Bartender moves to the back of the bar, grabbing his machete.

               At the same moment, Coach emerges from behind the bar in 
               very snug, feminine-looking pink sweat pants.

                                     BOZO
                         You! Zorba! You're coming too!
                              (to Heroine)
                         Now gimme the keys.

               Heroine tosses the keys to Bartender.

                                     HEROINE
                         No. You're locked in.

                                     BOZO
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         Those two will be on the other side 
                         waiting for you. If you become food, 
                         I don't want the only set of keys in 
                         the belly of one of those things.

                                     BOZO
                         Don't get your hopes up.

               Bozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and 
               it gets worse with each step. Bartender and Coach follow.

               Heroine turns to the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Any volunteers to head into the 
                         basement with me?

                                     TUFFY
                         I will.

               Tuffy stands, sniffling. She wipes the tears from her eyes, 
               looking tough and resolute.

                                     BEER GUY
                         That's not a good idea.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         With what happened upstairs --

                                     TUFFY
                         Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have 
                         no idea what is running through me 
                         right now. No idea.
                              (to Heroine)
                         I'm ready.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright.

                                     ROADIE
                         Count me in.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Me too.

               Heroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Beer Guy all move to the basement. 
               The door creaks open slowly. The group descends.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the railing and 
               pulls himself up the staircase like an old man.

                                     BOZO
                         Alright you two, I don't want to 
                         hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the 
                         key, wrong key, ain't no key here." 
                         When I want out, I want out, ok?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (displaying keys)
                         They're right here.

                                     COACH
                         We've got your back, bro.

               They unlock the door, swinging it open.

                                     BOZO
                         Just keep 'em handy, ladies.

               Bartender has the key in the thick dead bolt, ready to move.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo hustles in. The door shuts and locks.

                                     BOZO
                         Wish me luck...

               WHAM! Bozo is on the ground.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         I'm okay! I'm okay!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on. Come on. Come on.

               Bozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from 
               Cody's attack. The TV illuminates the room.

                                     BOZO
                         Geeezzzus.
                              (moving gingerly)
                         Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. 
                         Easy steps.

               MAIN BAR

               Belle kneels next to the Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         How are you holding up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well...

               He pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her.

                                     BELLE
                         What is this?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Morphine. My magic potion. I need a 
                         few drops.

               She puts a few drops on his out-stretched tongue.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You should try a little, it'll calm 
                         your nerves. Works like a charm.

                                     BELLE
                         No other time than now, right?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, before you do that, help me 
                         move. There's a small room off the 
                         kitchen where I can lay down.

                                     BELLE
                         But --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It's much safer in there. Trust me.

               BASEMENT

               The basement is dark, dingy and scattered with crap. Dried 
               out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on hooks. A WINDOW 
               is open. Roadie slams it shut, eyeing the room, staring into 
               the dark corners.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay on your toes everybody.

               Tuffy tightly grips her weapon, ready to fire. Heroine kneels 
               next to a hatch door that emits a red glow.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's this?

               Roadie jams a pipe into the little door, bracing it shut.

                                     ROADIE
                         You don't need to know what that is.

               Beer Guy finds the dusty locker and opens it.

                                     BEER GUY
                         There's a sawed-off shotgun in here.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach have their ears pressed to the door.

                                     COACH
                         Come on, bro.

               Behind them, through a boarded window, something CRAWLS 
               upward.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo moves turtle slow.

                                     BOZO
                         Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.

               He moves to the Boss Man's private room. He puts his hand 
               out to open it. Trembling, he touches the knob and...

               CREEEEEEEEAK! The door eases open. Bozo steps inside the 
               room. He moves over to a lamp and pulls the chain. A bat 
               FLIES off the lamp shade SCREECHING. Bozo falls backwards.

                                     BOZO
                         HAAAA!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach jump back.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants.

                                     BOZO
                         Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         If he doesn't shut up...

                                     COACH
                         He is human kabob.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               The room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot, 
               kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation.

               Belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair.

                                     BELLE
                         Doesn't your foot hurt?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I can't feel a thing, Hon.

                                     BELLE
                              (touching his crotch)
                         How 'bout now?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You're a bad girl, aren't you.

               Belle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes.

                                     BELLE
                         Um-hmmm.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         The girl's got rhythm.

               She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts 
               up her skirt and bends over, giggling.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         There it is.

               BASEMENT

               Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor.

                                     ROADIE
                         This is all junk.

               Beer Guy holds a rusted machete.

                                     BEER GUY
                         This could come in handy.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's get everything upstairs.

               Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by 
               the arm and takes her aside.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry, I'm fine. Really.

                                     HEROINE
                         I admire your strength.

                                     TUFFY
                         Trust me, I plan on having a full 
                         breakdown when this is over, but for 
                         now, we all have to be strong, right?

               Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL 
               LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a 
               LITTLE GIRL.

                                     HEROINE
                         This is my daughter, Charlie. She's 
                         all I'm after.

                                     TUFFY
                              (fighting back tears)
                         Oh...

                                     HEROINE
                         And I'm gonna need your strength, 
                         every bit of it.

                                     TUFFY
                         You have it.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. But still do me a favor.

                                     TUFFY
                         Name it.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with a wink)
                         Don't tell anyone I have a soft side.

                                     TUFFY
                              (tiny smile)
                         Deal.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the 
               CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He 
               drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs.

                                     BOZO
                         Hello? Anyone there? We need help 
                         out here at the United Nations Tavern. 
                         Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 
                         10-4. S.O.S.

               All he gets is static. A faint GROWL is heard outside. OUTSIDE 
               THE DOOR Bartender hears the growl, his eyes grow wide.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her 
               tongue at Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         You wanna see, baby?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hell yeah.

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         How much I got, what?

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got to see the show?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You don't understand, sweety. Daddy 
                         doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for 
                         free. But you do get points for being 
                         horny on a night like this.

               She cringes and backs up a little.

                                     BELLE
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You can't expect a man to buy a car 
                         without a test drive first, can you?

                                     BELLE
                         Um, hmm --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Now wiggle that sweet little ass 
                         over here and sit on Daddy's face, I 
                         wanna do some appraising.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo barks into the CB.

                                     BOZO
                         Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling 
                         all cars! Calling all cars! We need 
                         help at the United Nations Tav --

               The CB is JERKED from Bozo's hands and slams into the wall.

                                     BOZO
                         Shit!

               Bozo aims the gun at the wall. Chewing sounds begin.

                                     BOZO
                         Double shit!

               He backs up to the door.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         Okay, I'm ready to come out now!

               Bartender confidently turns the key. CLICK! It breaks off in 
               the lock.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh!

               SECOND FLOOR

                                     BOZO
                         "OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" 
                         mean?

               Bozo knocks on the door hard.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender looks to Coach.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Wha?

               A thunderous CRASH! Boards fly off the wall.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle, hearing the crash, jerks back from Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         What was that?

               CRASH! Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 punch through the 
               tiny wall fan and GRAB Belle by the scalp. She is JERKED 
               against the wall.

               She's slammed against it repeatedly and then -- RIP! Belle's 
               skin is TORN from her head and torso. Boss Man jumps back.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!

               Belle falls into Boss Man's arms for a HIDEOUS KISS.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         NO! NO! NO!

               Boss Man shoves the bloody Belle back against the wall.

               Sister Beast #1 pokes her head inside the room, hissing. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine and the others, just returning from the basement, 
               hear the mayhem from upstairs and the kitchen.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Coach fumbles desperately with the jammed lock, trying to 
               use his fingernails to turn the metal stump.

                                     COACH
                         Great god, why do you damn me?!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the 
               Momma and Papa Beast chomping at the wall.

                                     BOZO

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man uses the cot to block the Sister Beasts from 
               entering. They hiss and shred the cot fabric.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         They're getting in! Somebody help!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo kicks and punches the door.

                                     BOZO

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine charges up the staircase. Roadie rips the sawed-off 
               weapon from Beer Guy and runs for the kitchen.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         The key broke off!

                         Move it!

               Heroine rips the earring from Bartender's ear. He YELPS. She 
               jams the backing into the lock.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man crawls for the door. Sister Beast #1 fires out a 
               whip-like tongue and snags Boss Man's damaged foot. He howls 
               in pain. Sister Beast #2 tongue-lasso's his other foot.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Heroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort.

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         HELP ME PLEASE!!!

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man is pulled towards the Sister Beasts.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         HELLLLLP!!!

               Roadie kicks open the door and FIRES at the Sisters. They 
               dive back out of the room screeching.

               SECOND FLOOR

                                     BOZO
                         HELLLLLLLLP!!!

               Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window.

               Papa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his 
               shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin.

               The door flies open. Bozo is YANKED to safety just as Papa 
               STRIKES the closing door.

               MAIN BAR

               The patrons track the wild CRASHING and HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING 
               sounds of Papa Beast. He finally breaks out of the upstairs. 
               Beer Guy and Roadie carry Boss Man into the room as Coach, 
               Bartender, Heroine and the shaken Bozo creep down the stairs.  
               Bozo slowly takes a seat in his brother's lap.

                         That back room is sealed shut.

               Heroine glares at Boss Man.

                                     HEROINE
                         I told you to stay in the main room.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Yeah... I will. I will. Promise.

               Coach eyes the group, this is his time to shine.

                                     COACH
                              (rising, full of brawn)
                         If they can't reproduce anymore -- 
                         we are one step closer! A big step! 
                         Now is the time to band together. We 
                         need to rise up against these monsters 
                         of the night! Those creatures are no 
                         match for the human spirit! We can 
                         do it! We just need to believe in 
                         each other! In all of us! We need to 
                         make a stand! Right here! Right now!

               Long silence. Bozo stares.

                                     BOZO
                         Dude, are you gay?

               Coach sits down, humbled.

                                     HEROINE
                         We know what not to do. We must stay 
                         focused and together. The beasts 
                         will find a breach. We gotta find a 
                         way out before they find a way in.

                         Let's run for the cars, cause mass 
                         confusion.

                         The lot's too damn far, that's 
                         surefire suicide.

               The room is silent. Bartender motions to Boss Man, but he is 
               promptly shushed by Boss Man. Heroine notices.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?

                         You know what.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I don't know shit.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Roadie)
                         You. What was that door downstairs?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, wait, wait.

               Heroine glares at Roadie.

                                     HEROINE
                         Don't bullshit me.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It's a tunnel.

               Roadie nods, causing Boss Man to sigh.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It runs about a hundred yards and 
                         spits out on the backside of that 
                         hill down the way.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for?

               They clam up.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for!?

                         Does the tunnel spit out near a car?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It spits out behind the parking lot.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My truck is near, but it ain't nearly 
                         big enough to haul the whole lot.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's a shot. Is it gassed up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fully.

                         How many can it hold?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Six.

                         Seven.

                         It's gonna fit thirteen.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit.

                         Three of us go. Two to defend, one 
                         to drive. We back up to the bar and 
                         then tear ass out of here.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Sounds sketchy.

                         Let me make this clear; if we stay, 
                         we die.

               Boss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string 
               around his neck.

                         surrounded, but if we go under them 
                         we might just make it.

                         happen.

               SMACK! Bozo SLAPS Coach's ass.

                         The rest of you prepare the weapons, 
                         whatever you got left. 'Cause when 
                         we crash through those walls, we're 
                         bringin' death with us.

               Heroine takes The Judge from Bartender and hands it to Coach.

                         No, I don't believe in guns.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This ain't time for a political 
                         stance.

               Coach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy.

                                     COACH
                         This doesn't run out of ammo.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Got ya.

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach move to the basement.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey!

               The three look to Bozo, who offers a parting nod.

                                     BOZO
                         When you get to that truck... drive 
                         it like you stole it.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               At a booth, Trampy re-bandages Adulterer's eye.

                                     TRAMPY
                         How does it feel?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Lousy.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You still have one left.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes, the silver lining.

                                     TRAMPY
                         It serves you right for cheating.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Spare me.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I figure it's karma. You wronged me 
                         and you wronged your wife, so this 
                         is karma biting you on the ass, or 
                         in your case... in the eye.

               Bozo moves close, surveying the bandage work.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh yeah?

                                     TRAMPY
                         It could be worse, you could be dead. 
                         Then again, the climax is upon us.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy's hair)
                         Ya know, that's not a bad look on 
                         you. Kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd 
                         hook it up.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I wouldn't fuck you for practice.

                                     BOZO
                         Tease.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Leave her alone.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey, cyclops. Let's have a quiet 
                         contest... starting now.

               Bozo turns his attention back to Trampy.

                                     BOZO
                         Ya know, in situations of duress, I 
                         have found that women are attracted 
                         to my authority.

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach make their way through the 
               basement. Creeks and cracks with every step.

                                     ROADIE
                              (to Heroine)
                         You handle yourself pretty well. You 
                         a cop or a criminal?

                                     HEROINE
                         Neither. Just a farmer.

                                     ROADIE
                         Oh yeah? Then how do you do it?

                                     HEROINE
                         I just think about my husband and 
                         daughter... and the rest is easy.

               The light casts a shadow of something BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

               Roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed-off barrel.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy.

               WHIP! The curtain slides. It's a dried animal hide on a hook. 
               They all sigh. Roadie unblocks the tiny door.

               Heroine scans the room.

                                     ROADIE
                         This place is creepy in the daytime, 
                         too. Ready?

               Coach's hand shakes as he raises his weapon.

                                     ROADIE
                         Scared?

                                     COACH
                         No. You?

                                     ROADIE
                         Of course not. I fight monsters all 
                         the time.
                              (gripping the door)
                         On three.

               Roadie, Heroine raise their weapons.

                                     COACH
                         One... two... three!!!

               Roadie whips open the door. Nothing.

               BANG-GONG-GONG! Some pipes CRASH to the ground next to them... 
               they jump, but nothing is there. A LITTLE MOUSE emerges from 
               the fallen heap.

                                     COACH
                         Well, look at that.

               Coach leans down and puts out his hand. He smiles as Heroine 
               watches over his shoulder.

                                     COACH
                         Hey, little fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's go.

               He leaves the mouse and follows Heroine to the tunnel.

               SLURP! A pink tongue LASSOS the mouse.

               A red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel. They all 
               drop in, one by one, entering the steamy, confined space.

                                     COACH
                         Looks like a brothel for plants.

                                     ROADIE
                         Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for 
               movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

               Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.

                                     BOZO
                         Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong!

                                     BEER GUY
                         What do you know?

                                     BOZO
                         I know you're doing it wrong.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Prove it.

               Bozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles.

                                     BOZO
                         Move aside, princess.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry 
               red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh 
               marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick 
               pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering 
               system. There is about six inches of water on the floor.

                                     COACH
                              (to Roadie)
                         You and I are similar. We both have 
                         accents. We both travel a lot. We 
                         both don't really have homes...

                                     ROADIE
                         You should be quiet.

                                     COACH
                         I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous.

                                     HEROINE
                         Quiet.

               Coach bites his lip, dying to say something.

                                     COACH
                         It's just that this seems like the 
                         opportune time for someone to be 
                         horribly... offed.

                                     ROADIE
                         What did I say?

                                     COACH
                         Sorry. I'm done now.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles.

                                     BOZO
                         You don't want the rag touching booze, 
                         that way you can hold it and ensure 
                         it explodes when you throw it.

                                     PARA
                         You sure? I thought the rag had to 
                         touch?

                                     BOZO
                         I'm sure.

               Bozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer.

                                     BOZO
                         Perfecto. What we should do, though, 
                         is put those peanut barrels to use. 
                         Fill 'em with booze and line up some 
                         planks. If the walls come down... we 
                         hit 'em Donkey Kong style.

               Para and Beer Guy eye the three large peanut barrels, perfect 
               for bomb-making.

                                     PARA
                         Genius.

                                     BEER GUY
                         You aren't nearly as dumb as you 
                         look, are you?

                                     BOZO
                         Next time, look within. Stereotyping 
                         can be ugly and hurtful.

               Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder.

                                     BOZO
                         Excuse me for being forward, but I'm 
                         curious about your dimensions.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The 
               tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hold up. You hear something?

               A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above.

                                     ROADIE
                         They're trying to burrow through the 
                         tunnel walls.

                                     HEROINE
                         Move.

               The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end 
               of the tunnel as well.

                                     COACH
                         Like moles these things.

               Then, Sister Beast #1 drops into the tunnel from the far 
               end.

               She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her.

                                     ROADIE
                         Duck!

               Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable 
               to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister 
               Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims 
               his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his 
               shot.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay down!

               From her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three 
               shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered 
               in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face.

                                     HEROINE
                         Go! The bitch is mine!

               Roadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend 
               with the Beast.

               Heroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well.

               Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding 
               the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth 
               with the gun, knocking her back.

               Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm.

               Heroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others.

                                     HEROINE
                         Look out!

               Roadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through 
               the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks.

               Roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles.

                                     ROADIE
                         The shells are wet!

               With the two Beasts closing in. The men are trapped. Coach 
               looks around, seeing a plan.

                                     COACH
                         Grab onto ceiling and get out of 
                         water!

                         What?

                                     COACH
                         Do it!!!

               Grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls 
               himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power 
               cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end.

                                     COACH
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get out of water!!!

               Heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came.

               As the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the 
               water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait 
               for Heroine to get out of the water.

               The second she does, he jams the cord into the water.

               ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister 
               Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke 
               rises from their cooked bodies.

               Roadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin 
               shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel.

               INT. TUNNEL/BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               Heroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters 
               the basement.

               GAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the 
               floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly. 
               Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill.

               Heroine raises her weapon.

                                     HEROINE
                         You fuck with my family. 
                              (aiming shotgun)
                         I fuck right back!

               Click -- out of ammo!

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh shit.

               Heroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE.

               She rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers.

               She swings again but gets whacked to the floor.

               Heroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives 
               into the KEG ELEVATOR.

               She slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure 
               and lunges. BAM! It CRASHES against the door.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               Roadie and Coach crawl to the platform by the exit.

                                     COACH

                         bravery.

                         If there's anybody left.

               The two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above.

               At the top, Roadie pushes off the plywood covering. The two 
               men peer into the night and spot the TRUCK.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Heroine wedges the door closed. The Beast continues to try 
               to get in. Heroine bangs the top of the small elevator...

                         Hey! Hey! She's in the shaft!

               Beer Guy hits the button. The gears grind and start to pull 
               the elevator up to the main floor.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Heroine squirms as the elevator rises.

                         Move it! Move it! Move it!

               As Teen Beast starts to tear at the base of the rising keg 
               elevator in the shaft, Heroine pounds and tears at the few 
               planks above her in the keg elevator.

               The elevator SHAKES. Heroine POUNDS a hole through the 
               elevator top. She tries to squeeze through the SMALL HOLE.

               Teen Beast BITES through the floor board of the keg elevator.

               CLANGGG! The elevator stops. Heroine lurches and grabs the 
               greasy cables to stop her fall.

                                     HEROINE

               Heroine almost has the primary cable cut. Teen Beast rises 
               up to bite.

               SNAP!! The cable BREAKS. Heroine SOARS up the shaft. Teen 
               Beast is pulled down to the bottom. The keg elevator door 
               bursts open on impact.

               Heroine SLAMS into the ceiling, kicking and yelling.

               ready to feed. Tuffy points her shotgun.

               BLAM! Teen lurches back, dropping back down the shaft.

               Tuffy slams the keg door shut. Heroine pants on the floor.

               notices the peanut barrels on top of the bar. Two wooden 
               planks serve as track, leading straight for the side wall.

               Boss Man sips a bottle, still hopped-up on morphine. He lazily 
               loads his pistol from a pool of bullets on his belly.

                         to get a whole lot worse before it 
                         gets any better.

               SNAPPP!!! His head and legs SLAP together as the arm pulls 
               him through a small hole in the floor.

               The group jumps back. Blood rockets out. His body is pureed 
               down the tiny hole.

               wheelchair, violently shaking it. Para FALLS to the floor.

               Teen Beast's arm grabs Para's leg...

               Dead silence.

               Then, far is the distance, beyond the walls, a sound is heard. 
               It's screaming. And it's approaching. Rapidly. The survivors

               The survivors shake in sickened silence. From beyond the

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With every strike, a splattering of blood 
               spits through the planks of wood.

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With a final furious strike, a few wood 
               planks splinter. Papa Beast sticks in his head and hisses.

               back Papa Beast. The wooden walls go up in flame.

               Para, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38 
               from the floor.

               The second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the 
               breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts 
               stay far away.

               Teen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's 
               table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to 
               the floor.

               Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, 
               moves in to feed.

               Para points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and 
               flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power 
               magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just 
               as Teen Beast strikes...

               POP! The shot hits Teen Beast in the eye, sending him back 
               down the hole in the floor.

               Heroine and Bartender move in. When Teen Beast sticks his 
               head out of the hole again, they thrust both their shotguns 
               into each ear.

                                     HEROINE
                         Now!

               BLAM-BLAM! The two shots scatter head everywhere.

               The flames in the bar spread, catching the entire wall and 
               roof on fire.

               EXT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               The second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the 
               bar. Suddenly, the top is knocked off. Trampy sticks her 
               head out.

               Seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for 
               the nearby BEER TRUCK.

               INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               Papa and Momma Beast both charge the bar. The third peanut 
               barrel is released. It sails for them, but they dive out of 
               the way.

               KABLOOM! It takes out the rest of the wall. Fire and smoke 
               fills the place.

               Adulterer douses Momma Beast with booze as Beer Guy nails 
               her with a lit Molotov cocktail.

               WHOOSH! Engulfed in flame, she bolts from the bar shrieking.

                                     BOZO
                         One down, one to go!!!

               Papa enters and is instantly cornered. He swings wildly.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Bartender)
                         Help me!

               Heroine and Bartender rip the DEER HEAD from the wall and 
               charge Papa, pinning him against the wall with the antlers.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on!

               Bozo and Beer Guy dive into Papa's legs, holding them down.

               Tuffy picks up The Judge.

               WHAM! The shotgun butt knocks out Papa's front teeth. Tuffy 
               raises the weapon again, staring down at the monster that 
               killed her child, but Papa Beast gets an arm free to knock 
               away her fatal blow.

               Bartender wrenches Papa Beast's arm with all his might. With 
               her hair stuck in Papa Beast's claw, Tuffy is pulled face to 
               face with the beast. She squirms as he chomps at her, but 
               with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I can't hold him!!!

                                     HEROINE
                         Do something!!!

               Tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into Papa Beast's 
               mouth, jamming it down his throat. He instantly gags, sucking 
               for air.

               Papa Beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight.

               Papa Beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen.

               His eyes widen, face to face with Tuffy.

                                     TUFFY
                         CHOKE ON IT!!!

               With one last lunge, Papa Beast shakes, his life drifting 
               away. His eyes turn black as his body goes limp. Tuffy pulls 
               out her arm from his throat.

                                     BARTENDER
                         God...

                                     BOZO
                         I need to get your number.

               Tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. As the group pulls away, Papa 
               Beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug 
               into the wood.

               Heroine turns to Grandma and Grandpa, offering a hand.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on, I'll help you.

                                     GRANDPA
                         No thank you, we're content.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm not leaving anyone behind.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Maybe next time, dear.

               Heroine swallows and nods. HONK-HONK-HONK! Just outside the 
               breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel, 
               waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer 
               of SMOKE blankets the entire area.

               The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from 
               advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.

                                     HEROINE
                         She's still out here.

               Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stay put.

               She creeps out alone.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you... come on...

               Nothing. Just smoke. And silence.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Come on!

               From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.

               At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, 
               leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering 
               the back.

               INSIDE TRUCK

               Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She 
               advances, hissing.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come and get me you blood-chugging 
                         CUNT!

               Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg 
               door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, 
               Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.

               OUTSIDE TRUCK

               Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You got her? You got her!

                                     HEROINE
                         Not for long, we gotta burn it.

               Heroine looks to the others at the breach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Let's blow this thing!

               The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt 
               and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with 
               Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails 
               to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.

                                     BEER GUY
                         When this lights, run like hell.

               About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his 
               silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                              (catching lighter)
                         Here we go...

               Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!

               A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.

               It's Momma Beast. Again and again.

                                     TUFFY
                         What is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's calling for help.

               Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the 
               truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the 
               fire with his foot.

                                     BOZO
                         The fan has officially been buried 
                         in the shit.

               Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of 
               the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. 
               The group gasps. Trampy backs away.

                                     TRAMPY
                         We have to run --

               BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, 
               UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box 
               of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. 
               From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma 
               Beast emerges.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get to your cars!!!

               The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.

               Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast 
               RIPS Para from Bozo's back.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker! Give him back!

               Bozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still 
               alive. Bozo turns back and sees him.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh Jesus!

                                     PARA
                         HELLLPPP!

               Bozo grabs his brother and puts him on his back again, runs.

                                     BOZO
                         I thought we lost you --

               Para is RIPPED into the air again.

                                     BOZO
                         You FUCKER!

               Tuffy and Bartender jump into his PICKUP TRUCK.

                                     TUFFY
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get in!

               Heroine hops in the back.

               Beer Guy and Adulterer run to a car together. Beer Guy lags 
               behind, continually looking over his shoulder.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Run and quit looking back!

               As Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit 
               him HIGH-AND-LOW, cutting him in half. Bozo makes it to his 
               Trans-Am.

                                     BOZO
                         DO IT!

               VAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car roars to life. He pushes in a tape.

               The "MIAMI VICE" theme song blares from the speakers.

                                     BOZO
                         Get me FUCK BIRDS!

               Bozo peels out. Aunt Beast lands right in his path.

                                     BOZO
                         No you don't!

               BAM! He SMACKS Aunt Beast head on, sending the creature's 
               disemboweled body sailing through the air.

                                     BOZO
                         VENGEANCE!

               Para DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting. Cars are 
               moving everywhere.

                                     PARA

               The burning JUKEBOX plays a slow love song. Dancing and 
               holding each other, Grandpa smooches Grandma on the forehead.

                                     GRANDPA

                         HELP ME! HELP ME SOMEBODY!

               Bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off the blood 
               and guts. He spots Para.

                                     BOZO
                         Hang on!

               Para claws the ground.

               Bartender jerks the wheel of his car.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh shit!

               Para sees Bartender's approaching truck.

               Para rolls right, just missing tires. Para yells for his

                         COME ON! GODDAMN IT!

               Bozo's eyes bulge.

                         Brother!!!

               BAM! Para is SMEARED by Adulterer's car.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Shit!

               Bozo floors it.

                                     BOZO
                              (overly endearing)
                         I meant to tell you so much!

               The remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road.

               Grandpa and Grandma hold each other tight. Uncle Beast enters,

               Bozo guns the engine, crashing out the other end of the bar.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker!!!

               Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN.

               He hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE 
               from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.

               Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and 
               looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife.

                                     BOZO
                         Lord, if I die, bury me upside down 
                         so the world can KISS MY ASS!

               Cousin Beast leaps in.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The remaining TWO CARS race down the road.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               With the peddle to the floor, Bartender drives.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I think we're in the clear --

               BAM! Momma Beast lands on the roof. She reaches inside and 
               yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers.

               Tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma 
               yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out 
               Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel.

               IN THE BACK

               Momma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast 
               nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one 
               claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on 
               tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck.

               Tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything.

               Momma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags 
               Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's 
               face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second.

               Her remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine.

               Momma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams!

               And then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket 
               and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone, 
               taking the locket with her.

               Heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for 
               what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy 
               jumps out.

                                     TUFFY
                         Are you okay?!

                                     HEROINE
                         I don't know, I think --

                                     ADULTERER (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               They both jump as Adulterer approaches.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Are you two all right? They left! We 
                         made it! I think we made it!

                                     TUFFY
                         They'll be back.

                                     HEROINE
                         We're safe until dark, but we need 
                         to find other people.

               Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a 
               pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter.

                                     HEROINE
                         You know where the IGA grocery store 
                         is over in Red Mountain?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Um, yeah, ten miles west.

                                     HEROINE
                         They have a bomb shelter.

               PING! The lighter springs out, hot. Heroine lights up and 
               passes one to Tuffy.

                                     HEROINE
                         We'll meet in three hours?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't wanna go home alone... I 
                         don't wanna see what might have...

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry about that. Just go.

               Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the 
               desolate road.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry about your son. I really 
                         am.

               Tuffy nods, affectionately touching his hand.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Where are you two going?

                                     HEROINE
                         We're going to get my little girl.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I wish you luck.

               The car peels off. Adulterer watches the car tear down the 
               road. He glances up at the RISING SUN.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               A sign reading "RED MOUNTAIN" swings lazily in the breeze.

               Tuffy and Heroine coast down a town road. There are random 
               POOLS OF RED BLOOD in the dirt. No one in sight.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               Adulterer drives along a small town road. There's no sign of 
               life here either.

               EXT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               The car pulls up to the house. The only sound is the wind.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy look at each other and proceed with caution.

               INT. ADULTERER'S CAR -- DAY

               He pulls up in front of his house. The front door is swinging 
               open, BANGING against the door frame.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Heroine enters the ransacked house. Tuffy follows.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He enters his house. It too, is a mess.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They look down the stairs to the basement. Nothing. They 
               move up the stairs to the second floor.

               SECOND FLOOR

               SMACK! They spin to the noise.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He moves up the stairs to the master bedroom. SMACK!

               There's a noise at the end of the hall. SMACK!

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They cautiously move to the last room in the hall. A 
               scratched, closed door without an outside handle.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no...

               Heroine kicks in the door and...

               There's a note on a teddy beer that says, "WE WENT TO THE 
               SHELTER. LOVE GRANDMA AND CHARLIE."

                                     TUFFY
                         They're alive!

               The shudders SMACK against the wall.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids.

               He sighs and puts it down.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY

               The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff 
               wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches 
               up the street.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings.  

                                     HEROINE
                         It's right up there, in the back of 
                         the store.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They 
               get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer 
               kneels against his car.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where is everyone?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't know, I just got here. Did 
                         you find your girl?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's supposed to already be here.

                                     TUFFY
                         Your family?

               Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.

                                     TUFFY
                         I'm sorry.

               Adulterer sheepishly nods.

                                     HEROINE
                         This place is a ghost town.

               The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond 
               the glass doors.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (pointing)
                         Look!

               In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE 
               stands staring at them.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie?

               Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets 
               awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie!

               As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Stop! There's something wrong!

                                     HEROINE
                         Honey!?

               The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her 
               ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, 
               the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh god.

               The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast 
               HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to 
               right, panic stricken.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mommy!

               The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something 
               is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but 
               Adulterer holds her at bay.

                                     ADULTERER
                         It's a trap!

               At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the 
               distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.

               Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for 
               Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole 
               cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.

               The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting 
               Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (gurgling blood)
                         Run!!!

               Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.

               Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store 
               front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him 
               towards her main prey. 

               A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the 
               survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close. 

                                     HEROINE
                              (a whisper)
                         I love you...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- AN HOUR LATER

               A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking 
               lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps 
               from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.

               A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed 
               alike in work boots, gas masks and coveralls. They go into 
               action honing in on rubble with SENSORS and COUNTERS.

                         Sir, we have movement!

               The Man in Tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of 
               blood and guts. Using the sensor equipment, the COMPANY MAN 
               follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store.

               INT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The place is torn to hell. Dust and soot hangs in the air.

               The men instinctively raise their high-powered rifles, letting 
               the flashlights on the ends lead the way. They follow the 
               trail of blood to a back FREEZER LOCKER.

               It's scratched, bashed and thrashed.

               Company Man #2 steps forward and uses a metal-cutting chainsaw 
               to cut through the hinges. The door falls with a THUD.

               As the dust clears, Tuffy, Heroine and Charlie stare back at 
               the men, huddled together in a defensive stance.

               The Man in Tan creaks his neck.

                         Gentlemen, help them to safety.

               Heroine, holding Charlie, lurches back.

                                     HEROINE
                         You're not safe, she's still alive, 
                         she'll be back...

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Relax. We know. We're the calvary.

               The Man in Tan steps forward, guiding the group out.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- MOMENTS LATER

               A bulky security truck pulls up. A DRIVER, holding a bloody 
               rag to his nose, gets out and moves to the back door.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         What happened to you?

               The Driver nods to the back of the truck, opening the door.

               Bozo lurches out, handcuffed and chained.

                                     BOZO
                         Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn 
                         hero for Christ's sake!

               A shirtless, irate BOZO sits next to Grandpa and Grandma in 
               the back. He settles at the sight of the others.

                                     GRANDMA
                         G'morning.

                                     BOZO
                         Thanks for waitin' for me back there, 
                         really fuckin' appreciate it!

               Heroine covers her daughter's ears as the survivors are helped 
               into the truck. Tuffy sits, looking to Bozo.

                                     TUFFY
                         How'd you survive?

                                     BOZO
                         I found a new weak spot on 'em, but 
                         it damn ain't pretty getting to it.

               Heroine, last in the truck, turns to the men.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you taking us?

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         A trauma center. We have doctors 
                         waiting.
                              (off Heroine's pause)
                         You're in good hands now.

               The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan 
               locks eyes with the Driver.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Do it quick and spread the mess.

               The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.

               The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck 
               drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: THE MAN IN TAN 
               AGE: 45 
               OCCUPATION: HE CAN'T TELL YOU 
               PURPOSE: TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR SEQUEL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: PRETTY F-ING GOOD

               The Man in Tan exhales a gust of smoke.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
