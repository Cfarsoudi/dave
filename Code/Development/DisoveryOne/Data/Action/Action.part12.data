          EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
           No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.

          EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY

          She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
          a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A

          SHOOTING STAR.
          Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
          CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.

          EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

          A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
          They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
          As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
          quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.

          EXT. CANOPY - DAY

          Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
          He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
          ignites the community - but too late.
          POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
          dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
          Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
          teeth and sends her off.
          Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
          around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
          MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
          an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
          Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
          CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER

          FROM HIS MOUNT.
          Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
          rally a counter-attack.
          But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
          the defense. It's chaos.
          SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
          one. Others take off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
          net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...

          A SHOT RINGS OUT.

          BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE

          AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.

          FADE TO WHITE
          TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.
          FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly
          red hair under a sterile cap.

          Franklin reaches for us, smiles...

                         FRANKLIN
          Here we go, Bright eyes.
          A MIST fogs our view for a moment.

                         CAROLINE
          Not too much. She needs to be
          calm, but alert.

          VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM
          Go ahead - send her through.
          A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a
          tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top.
          Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK.
          Bright Eyes.

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and
          jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified
          chimpanzee slide into the machine.
          The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.

                         WILL
          Start the scan.
          A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         TECHIE
          Scanning.

          INT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY

          Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the
           machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner.
          Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's
          full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.

                         DONNIE
          Stuff looks like Kool-aid.

                         CAROLINE
          Go ahead, I'm sure you could use
          it.

                         (OPENING VALVE)
          Starting the therapy...

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.
          The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other
          room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR

          RESTRAINTS.

                         FRANKLIN
          She's convulsing.
          Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright
          Eyes' heart.

                         WILL

                         (INTO INTERCOM)
          Please keep the monkey still.
          He focuses back on the monitor.

                         CAROLINE (INTERCOM)
          She's not a monkey.
          Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
          intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of
          his gaze.

          CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
          She's an ape. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas and orangutans, they're
          all apes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         WILL
          Good to know. Just keep it from
          moving.
          She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk
          sometimes.
          He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
          right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...

                         TECHIE
          Here we go.
          Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to
          succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.

          CHEER FROM THE GROUP.
          Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
          across his face. He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for
          the others.

                         WILL
          We're on our way.

                         (BEAT)
          Good work.

          INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY


                         CAROLINE
          What is this?
          Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who
          sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with
          colorful symbols.
          Bright Eyes presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Tree.

          SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER."
          Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          And this?
          The chimp presses another button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CAROLINE
          Where does the acorn come from?
          Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          Yes, but where does the acorn come
          from?

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE

                         NO -
          Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn. Tree. Acorn.
          The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process
          the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses
          another button.

          ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.
          The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-
          like gaze - is somehow CREEPY... The IMAGE FREEZES and we...

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WILL'S OFFICE
          Diplomas on the wall, books everywhere. Bright Eyes looks
          out at Will from a computer screen. He's got two CT SCANS
          sitting on the desk in front of him.

                         CAROLINE
          We started the therapy four weeks
          ago. This was yesterday.
          Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          There's been clear cell growth.
          Both on the frontal lobe and the
          neocortex.
          She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
          He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them
          and he's regretting that - gets in the way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         WILL
          I see that. But I don't understand
          the primate behavioral norms. She
          knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't
          any monkey know that?

                         CAROLINE
          No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives
          us a tree, which gives us an acorn.

                         WILL
          Abstract thought...

                         CAROLINE
          In a chimpanzee. Unheard of.
          Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
          moves away from him. He barely notices her now.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          You're calling her a monkey just to
          piss me off, aren't you?

                         WILL
          Start the other's on the 112.

                         (BEAT)
          And double this one's dose.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DUSK

          Will climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement
          to show. Abstract thought!
          He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner
          of an old military base.

          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL)

           Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in front of his house.
          Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The
          home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.
          As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER

          AND OVER ON A PIANO.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,
          stabbing at the key with his finger.
          Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
          emotional weight of this man, his father.

                         WILL
          Hey Dad.
          Walter looks up, whispers...

                         WALTER
          John... is that you?

                         WILL
          It's me. Will.

                         WALTER
          As thou dost, Anthony.
          (staring at the keys)
          .he hears no music. No music...

                         VOICE
          (heavy Russian accent)
          He's been doing that all day.
          A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.

                         IRENA
          He found an old book of his.
          She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
          pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.

                         IRENA (CONT'D)
          (shrugging on coat)
          I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
          so much, Mr. Walter.

                         WILL
          My mother was the one. She liked
          Shakespeare...

                         IRENA

                         (KISSES HIM)
          Good night, Walter, hone-ee.
          She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.

                         I WILL
          Come on, Dad.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Will helps his father change into pajamas.

                         WILL
          Remember I told you we were using
          Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
          the apes? Well the therapy seems
          to be working. We've seen definite
          signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
           Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Board of Directors is coming in a
           couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
          that's clinical trials.
          Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
          understanding what Will's saying.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Human trials, Dad. Soon.

                         WALTER
          I rather tell that what is to be
          feared than what I fear: for
          always... I am Caesar...
          There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..

                         WILL
          I'm going to make you better - I
          swear it.
          His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?

                         WALTER
          John... ?

                         WILL

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          No, Dad, it's me. Will.
          Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          John's gone.
           He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the
          walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
          at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT

          It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
          beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
          He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY

          Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.

                         FRANKLIN
          Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.
          Monty. Hey - what's the matter,
          don't like my cooking?

          SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
          He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
          cage.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          You okay back there?

                         CAROLINE
          Something wrong with Bright Eyes?

                         FRANKLIN
          I'll check on her when we're done.
          Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
          next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
          Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
          cranium.
          From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
          door as Lucky's strapped down.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAME

          Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair
          brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
          steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.

                         JACOBS
          You could at least try to look
          excited.

          10.
          Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
          disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.

                         WILL
          I'm not good with this stuff.
          Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.

                         JACOBS
          You'll do fine. Just speak
          English. Keep the science simple.

          INT. LAB - SAME

          From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the
          open door as the ape on the table convulses.

                         CAROLINE
          Okay. Back it out...

                         DONNIE
          Your turn.
          Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO

          DONNIE CAN'T OPEN THE CAGE.

                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
          C'mon - Let go -
          She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S

          WHEN HE NOTICES: HER HANDS ARE BLOODY.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Hey! Something's wrong with number
          four!
          Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
          table...

                         FRANKLIN
          Be right over -
          Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
          different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?

                         DONNIE
          What's the matter with you?

          INT. BOARDROOM - SAME

          Will stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN
          behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,
          he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER.

          large subcortical regions of the
          brain...

          INT. LAB - SAME

          Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff. Once more he tries
          to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.
          Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS

          HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.

                         DONNIE
          Hey!!!
          Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other
          apes begin to SCREECH.
          Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
          Someone get her off of me!

                         CAROLINE
          Hang on -
          Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
          over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

           Will continues his presentation. Stevens looks around at the
          board members - they're lost.

                         WILL
          In the past, it's been impossible
          to target specific areas, both
          because of the Blood Brain Barrier -
          Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.

                         JACOBS
          What Dr. Rodman has done is to
          invent a virus that can, for the
          first time, cross the membrane that
          protects the brain and deliver a
          genetic, therapeutic, payload.

                         WILL
          (trying to sell)
          This 'payload' would directly
          affect the areas of memory, higher
          function - and, of course, the
          motherlode: intelligence.
          The board members stare, trying to comprehend.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          Meaning?

                         WILL
          Meaning.
          (deep breath here)
          If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're
           looking at a cure for Alzheimer's.
           With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
           from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic
          effect.

          INT. LAB - DAY


                          DONNIE
          She's breaking my hand!

                         CAROLINE
          Let go, Bright Eyes! You're
          hurting him!
          She tries to help pull Donnie away.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          Let go!
          In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.

          LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND

          THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY.

          HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH.

                         FRANKLIN
          Lucky no! Stop!

                         (TO CAROLINE)
          Hit the alarm!
          Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.

          DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO...

          INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME

          LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN
          of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he
          scampers - unattended - down the hall.

                         GUARD #1
          Uh oh.
          Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN

          SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO

          GET HIM FREE.

                         GUARD #2
          Hey, Len...?
          Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...
          Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet...

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY

          Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the
          grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest
          building.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

          The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's
          pronouncement.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          What about the safety of the virus?

                         WILL
           Perfectly safe. We're using the
          most stable -
          A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.
          Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!
          Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and
          pinning him to the wall. It happens fast.
          The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY

          INCISORS...
          â¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK.
          The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams -
          collapses on the boardroom table.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS
          and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS.
          Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE
          and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline
          walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder
          packed in ice.
          He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.

                         WILL
          Are they gone?

                         JACOBS
          Long gone.
          Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.

                         WILL
          Did they say anything before they
          left? I mean, about Phase 2.

                         JACOBS
          Look around you, for Christ sakes.
          We'll be lucky if we don't go to
          jail.
          Will's gutted - devastated.

                         WILL
          But we're so close.

                         JACOBS
          You think you're the only one who's
          got something at stake here? I've
          got my own skin in this game!

                         WILL
          What happened had nothing to do
          with the 112.
          (desperate to clarify)
          Take an already aggressive animal,
          make it smarter - you're going to
          get a potentially dangerous

                         SITUATION -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         JACOBS
          What makes you so damned positive
          about that?
          (pauses for emphasis)
          What if this drug does things you
          don't understand? Are you going to
          take responsibility for that?
          Because I'm sure as hell not going
          to.
          Here Will hesitates.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          We're not ready for human trials.
          Hell, we weren't ready for monkey
          trials.

                         WILL
          They're apes.

                         JACOBS
          This is what we're going to do:
          You're taking a sabbatical. I'll
          let the board handle the lawsuit.
          When this blows over I'll bring you
          back and we'll start over - we'll
          do it right this time. With mice.
          Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody.
          Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.

          INT. LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN
          HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV

          112.
          His work - destroyed.

          EXT. BACK LOT, BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT

          Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a
          jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE

          USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE.
          TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears.
          Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the
          window.

                         Â¢ FRANKLIN
          Show you something, boss?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         WILL
          I don't work here anymore,
          Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
          I just put down fifteen animals,
          Dr. Rodman. The least you could do
          is give me a moment of your time.
          Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,
          devastating day.

                         WILL
          of course.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT

          The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used
          SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the
          floor.
          It's a creepy, horrible scene.

                         FRANKLIN
          They're all gone.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely
          sorry...
          What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?
          Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He
          moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.
          At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The
          lighting's dim and the thing's so small...
          But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT

          CHIMPANZEE.
          Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It's impossible. How could a full-
          term gestation go unnoticed?

                         FRANKLIN
          They carry small. Must have been
          pregnant when they brought her in.
          Will tries to get his mind around the situation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         WILL
          Who else knows about this?

                         FRANKLIN
          No one.

                         (BEAT)
          I'd bring him home, but my brother-
          in-law works for security. He'd
          rat me out in a second.
          That's when will realizes.

                         WILL
          You want me to take him?

                         FRANKLIN
          He's an orphan now.

                         WILL
          I could be thrown in jail. He's a
          chimpanzee who's been exposed to a
          possibly dangerous drug.

                         FRANKLIN
          You don't believe that.

                         WILL
          Doesn't matter what I believe.

                         FRANKLIN
          Just for a couple days. Until I
          can find a sanctuary.

                         WILL
          That's not possible.

                         FRANKLIN
          I heard you outside, fighting to
          keep them alive.

                         WILL
          I was talking about the work, my

                         RESEARCH -

                         FRANKLIN
          she was just trying to protect him.

                         WILL
          What?

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         FRANKLIN
          Bright Eyes - the mother. That's
          why she wouldn't let anyone into
          her cage.
          Will looks down at the helpless baby.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -
          but there's nothing I can do here.
          He's got to be put down like the
          others.

                         FRANKLIN
          Tell you what, Doc.
          (producing a syringe)
          I'm done for the day. So you be my
          guest.
          Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.
          It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He
          enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his
          little hands.
          Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
          belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.
          Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who
          watches from outside the cage.

                         WILL
          Two days. Then you have to figure
          it out.

          INT. WALMART - NIGHT

          A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
          cart.
          Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered
          in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
          He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
          of choices.

          INT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT

          A TEEN rings up the baby goods.

                         TEEN CASHIER
          Hey man. Congratulations.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         WILL
          Huh?

                         (REALIZING)
          Oh. Thanks.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in his truck.

          EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his
          chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens
          the door.

                         IRENA
          It's Friday night. I had a date.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry - there was -
          She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the
          walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
           He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the
          refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.
          He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its
          contents in the sink.
          Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE

          VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND

          ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED
          WAIL comes from another part of the house.
          Will sits up, remembering.

          INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

          Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp
          lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,
          making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.

          20.
          Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide
          what to do.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the
          limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat
          and sits.

                         WILL
          It's okay. It's going to be okay.
          Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.
          Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The
          room fills with STEAM.

                         CUT TO:
          A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of
          a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.
          In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,
          FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT

          TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.
          Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily
          intimidates all the chimps around him.

          REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING

          THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.
          Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful
          in his arms.

          SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER"
          SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
          bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH
          THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.
          The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.
          The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air
          and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.
          As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
          LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...

          â¢INT. ATTIC -- DAY

          .the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT
          TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the
          walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.
          SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.
          The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER

          HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...

          EXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY

          From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire
          neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows
          his lawn.
          There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls
          up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
          HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his
          WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with
          his carry-on suitcase.
          Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's
          Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big
          brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his
          bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.
          The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
          TEARS and runs after them.

          WILL (O.S.)
          Caesar! Breakfast!
          The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.
          The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One
          of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around
          for the box, reads the side...
          AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.
          Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
          picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.
          Will walks over, sits across from him.

          Please pass the ketchup.
          Caesar slides the ketchup to Will.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Thanks.

                         CAESAR

                         LANGUAGE)
          You're welcome.
          NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there
          will be subtitles.

          INT. GEN-SYS LAB - DAY

           A MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its
          progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity.
          The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
          reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,
          studies the cone.

                         LAB TECH
          Is he going to turn left or
          right...?
          The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
          piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement
          blooming on his face.

                         WILL
          There it is. Restored cognitive
          function.

                         LAB TECH
          Same success rate as the primates.
          Congratulations.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

           VISITORS buy tickets at the entrance gates. Will pulls
           around to an Employee Parking Lot.

           INT. PRIMATE INFIRMARY, SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          Dr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes
           taking Caesar's blood pressure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         Â¢ STEWART
          He's right on target. Height.
          Weight...
          She checks Caesar's ears.

                         CAESAR
          Dairy Queen.

                         WILL
          After. Sit still.

                         STEWART
          What about diet?

                         WILL
          A healthy diet. Fruits,
          vegetables.

                         CAESAR
          Ice cream.
          Will ignores him.

                         STEWART
          What's he saying?

                         WILL
          He's hungry.
          Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will
          sends him a look - out it out.

                         STEWART
          He seems extremely intelligent.
          How many words does Caesar sign?
          Beat.

                         WILL
          You know, the basics.

                         CAESAR
          Soft-serve.

                         STEWART
          I've heard of apes learning up to a
          hundred and fifty words. Is he
          good with puzzles?
          Will hesitates.

          24.

                         WILL
          He's pretty good.

                         STEWART
          Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously
          happy. You're doing a great job
          with him.
          (doesn't want to alarm)
          But there is an anomaly I noticed.

                         WILL
          Like what?

                         STEWART
          When I was examining his eyes, I
          noticed a strange green
          pigmentation.

                         WILL
          Green?
          His heart starts to pound.

                         STEWART
          Green. Never.seen it before.
          She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Take a look.
          Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds

          FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          It's faint, can you pick it up?
          He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You alright? Want a glass of
          water?

                         WILL
          No thanks.

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Sure, that would be good.
          She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Forgot to eat today. Not a big
          deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (TO CAESAR)
          I'm fine.
          Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.

                         STEWART
          Carotid pulse is running a little
          fast.

                         WILL
          For a human or a chimpanzee?
          First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.

                         STEWART
          Gotta remember to eat.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream
          cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD"

          EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS.

          WILL (O.S.)
          You have to move the whole tower to
          another peg, one block at a time.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.
          Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
          wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the
          first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.
          Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a
          CAMCORDER on a tripod.

                         WILL
          Here's the hard part: you can't put
          a larger block on top of a smaller
          one.
          Caesar studies the puzzle.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Understand?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving
          blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking,
          getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller...
          Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower
          on a different pole. It's easy for him.
          Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his
          pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (STUNNED)
          He did it in fifteen moves.

                         IRENA
          What's the best score?

                         WILL
          Fifteen.
          Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.

                         IRENA

                         (AMAZED)
          I wonder where he gets such talent?

                         WILL
          (eyes on Walter)
          It was passed down from his mother.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

          Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and
          prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          At age two Caesar appears to exceed
          his mother's aptitude. He signs
          over three hundred words. He
          exhibits no visible side effects
          from the therapy...

          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Will flips on a light. Enters. Closes the door behind him.
           Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL, PADLOCKED
           REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it. Opens the door.
           Inside-WE SEE: THE SINGLE VIAL OF ADV 112.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his
          hand. He's deep in agonized thought.
          Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
          LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
          Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the
          brightness.

                         WILL
          (syringe in hand)
          Dad. I've got something that's
          going to make you better.
          Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC
          SQUEAKING NOISE as we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The movement of a SWING. Caesar's strapped in it, and WE

          NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.

          SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER
          Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a
          "little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.
          Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.
          At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the
          neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD

          PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.
          At the height of his backward motion he catches another
          glimpse.
          Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will's making sandwiches, his eye on Caesar through the
          window.

                         WILL
          (to someone offscreen)

          WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He
          begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Will pauses, listening to the MUSIC. He moves to the doorway
          to watch his father.
          The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.
          Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
          There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
          undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left
          side. CLICK.
          Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
          clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment
          to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.
          The color drains from his face.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

           Caesar stands at the edge of the yard, unsure what to do
          next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have
          stopped playing to stare at him.
          Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
          tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
          back to Caesar.

                         TODD'S BUDDY
          Check it. He wants to play.
          Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
          Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
          Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her
          brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         TODD
          Monkey in the middle.
          Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not
          sure what's funny.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!

                         WILL
          He won't go far.

                         WALTER
          You don't know that.

                         WILL
          I do, Dad.

          INT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while
          Caesar jumps to try and catch it.

          TODD AND FRIEND
          Monkey in the middle, monkey in the
          middle...
          Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-
          away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE

          FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.

          THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S

          GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.
          They're making fun of him.
          "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
          Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
          stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
          Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
          Alice runs inside.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:
          â¢ HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified
          chimp backs toward his fence.

                         HUNSIKER
          Hah! Hah -
          Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER
          AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.

                         WILL
          Hold on - it's okay - he's
          harmless!

                         HUNSIKER
          Your monkey came onto my property!
          Threatened my kids!
          By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
          in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.

                         WILL
          It won't happen again...

                         HUNSIKER
          Damn right it won't happen again!
          I'll press charges if it does!
          Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY


                         STEWART
          What does he do for fun?
          Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
          thrown by the question.

                         WILL
          Well we've got puzzles, games, a
          swing set...

                         STEWART
          My guess is he needs more. More
          exercise, more space.

                         WILL
          We'll work on that.
          Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen
          to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          He gets up his nerve.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          What about you?

                         (BEAT)
          What do you do for fun?
          She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't
          understand the question.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          How about dinner and a movie?
          Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.

                         STEWART
          I'm sorry, did you say something?
          He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.

                         WILL
          No - nothing.
          Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
          Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -
          but Will doesn't say more.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY

          From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the
          link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,
          extremely excited.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY

          As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS
          TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
          The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this
          place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar
          tugging at the leash.

                         WALTER
          Take him off the leash.

                         Â¢ WILL
          There's a place up ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY

          They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will
          kneels next to Caesar.

                         WILL
          Don't go far. Stay where I can see
          you.
          Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins
          flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's
          gratifying to see Caesar so happy.
          The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then
          another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A

          GROVE OF TREES.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING)
          Remember - stay where I can see you
          - if you got lost in these woods
          I'd never find you.

          BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE

          SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM

          A CANOPY OVERHEAD.

                         WALTER
          Go ahead. Climb!
          The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the
          branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.
          Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is
          obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and
          Walter become smaller and smaller down below.

          SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER
          RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy
          grace, exhilarated by the freedom.
          At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE

          LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP

          EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.

          HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP

          GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...
          Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at
          the mountains. Then down to Will below.
          Will's pointing to his watch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          â¢ CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands
          beside him on the forest floor.
          Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
          much taller now - over five feet.

                         WILL
          Sorry to rush you - got to get home
          and check on Walter.
          They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
          DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman
          struggles to control him.

                         WOMAN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Is that a chimpanzee?

                         WILL
          Don't worry - he's harmless. Very
          sweet.
          The big dog keeps BARKING.
          Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,

          CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.
          The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
          the Woman away.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Guess he had it coming.
          Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE

          LINGERING ON THE LEASH.
           THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -
          machinery everywhere.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY

          Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds
          himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.

                         WILL
          Where's Dr. Stewart?

                         S VETERINARIAN
          She doesn't work here anymore.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Doesn't work here anymore?

                         WILL
          Do you know where she went?

                         VETERINARIAN
          I'm sorry - I don't.
          Will's deeply disappointed.

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
          turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
          They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
          Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
          of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
          CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE

          LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.
          Caesar's transfixed.
          Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
          Neither makes a sound.

                         WILL
          Come on.
          As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb
          higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO

          SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
          walk home from school.
          One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
          her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
          smiles, flirts back.
          One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
          The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
          Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
          these teens. He wants to be one of them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.
          He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their
          posture, their gait.

          BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A

          CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.

          THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST

          LIKE ALPHA'S.
           He runs two fingers down the length of it.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's
          tension here, but we can't place it yet.
          Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
          USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,
          staring at it.

                         WILL
          Turn it around, Dad. You're using
          the wrong end.
          Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.
          With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the
          old man, adjusting the spoon.
          Will watches. Heartbroken.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path,
          leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one
          orange. The mouse hesitates, confused.
          He backs away from the cone.
          A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him,
          reading the number results on a monitor.
          Will's obviously discouraged.

                         WILL
          The drug's not staying ahead of the
          disease.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         JACOBS
          But we're still making progress,
          right?
          Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written
          all over his face.

                         WILL
          Sure. At this pace we'll get to
          trials by the time Hell freezes
          over.
          Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.

                         JACOBS
          This isn't graduate school -
          there's a procedure we have to
          adhere to.

                         WILL
          It'll take forever. I need to
          start developing a primate version
          now.
          Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.

                         JACOBS
          How's your father? Haven't seen
          him in a while.

                         WILL
          This isn't about him.

                         JACOBS
          He's worse, isn't he?
          Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell
          him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't.

                         WILL

                         (EVASIVE)
          He's fine.

          WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO.
          It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the
          following...

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed
          with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          Caesar continues to maintain a high
          level of cognition. But Walter's
          disease has caught up to the
          neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all
          initial improvement has been
          erased...
          Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note.
          Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will
          senses his presence. Looks up.

                         CAESAR
          Who Caesar.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         CAESAR
          Who.
          With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and
          tries to understand what Caesar wants from him.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Who.

                         WILL
          Caesar is an ape.

                         (SIGNING)
          A chimpanzee.

                         CAESAR
          No "what". "Who".
          Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual
          leap Caesar's taken.

                         WILL
          Are you asking about your identity?
          That's abstract thought, Caesar.
          Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CAESAR
          Walter Will father. Will Caesar
          father?
          Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his
          face. How to begin to answer?

          WILL (O.S.)
          This is where you were born. It's
          the place where I work.

          INT. MOVING CAR/PARKED CAR - DAY

          Will and Caesar are PARKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GEN-SYS
          LAB GROUNDS, its buildings visible through the fencing.

                         WILL
          I never knew your father, but your
          mother came to live here. This is
          where you were born.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother?

                         WILL
          She was very very smart. And she
          passed that onto you through her
          blood.
          Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar go. Caesar see.
          Will locks the car door.

                         WILL
          She's not here anymore. I'm sorry,
          Caesar - she died. That's when I
          brought you home to live with me
          and Walter.
          Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother...
          Will grows concerned.

                         WILL
          No. This is a bad place for you,
          Caesar. We're going to go now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          As Will pulls away Caesar strains for a last glimpse,
          twisting around to look out the back window.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Let's see if we can find something
          for you on the TV...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter has a new HOME AIDE - a pale, hard-looking older
          woman. He sits on the sofa staring at the TV's moving images
          as she changes channels.
          The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a
          SPACE LAUNCH. ASTRONAUTS wave to the PRESS CORPS as they
          board a SHUTTLE.

                         TV REPORTER
          The Icarus crew is led by Commander
          Colonel George Taylor. This is his
          fifth space mission...

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          CLOSE ON a crude drawing of an ape. Caesar sits on the
          floor, working on its details. As he draws the white
          birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-
          portrait.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck
          chair.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.
          REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.
          As if he's not sure where he is.
          Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE

          FRONT DOOR.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street
          ahead of him is quiet. No one around.
          Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the
          sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of
          SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The
          car SMASHES into a nearby tree.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the
          vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.
          Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,
          then turns to YELL at someone.
          That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
          He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker
          rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
          In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the
          menacing finger.

                         HUNSIKER
          Look at the front of my car you
          stupid, stupid old man! You should
          be locked up! Your son's going to
          pay for that damage -

          CAESAR EXPLODES OUT THE DOOR.
          No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS
          HUNSIKER to the ground.

                         WALTER
          Caesar...
          Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his
          fists.

                         HUNSIKER
          Help! Get him off -

                         WALTER
          Caesar... no... Stop!
          Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.
          But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old
          man off his back.
          Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE

          "JABBING" POINTER FINGER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         HUNSIKER
          Aaaaaaaah!
          Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE

          OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!
          Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks
          over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Please stop.
          Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and
          sprints for his house.

          CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S

          TOO BIG TO FIGHT.
          He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS
          HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him.

          EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY

          Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar
          flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to
          block Hunsiker's entrance.
          White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to
          his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -
          Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.
          He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances
          over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.
          Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to
          escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR

          HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.
          Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.
          Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE

          LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.
          Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree
          branch and swings from tree to tree.
          with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across
          the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.
          Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front
          of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.
          Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.

                         HUNSIKER
          Please no...
          Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.
          But then he sees something across the street that abruptly
          pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -

          BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.
          He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.
          All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          Will's car drives down a two-lane highway.

          REPORTER (V.0.)
          .chimpanzee named Caesar,
          terrorizing the quiet family
          enclave and mauling neighbor
          Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for
          Global Airlines.

          INT. JACOBS' LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Jacobs watches the evening NEWS.

                         REPORTER
          The defense claimed the chimp was
          merely trying to protect its owner
          from perceived aggression.
          FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews.
          Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)
          The chimpanzee's distraught owner,
          Wilson Rodman, has raised the
          animal since he was an infant.

          43.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)
          He pleaded to keep Caesar at home,
          citing the ape's remarkable
          intelligence.
          Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.

          INT. MOVING CAR Â»- DAY

          Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and
          a Polo shirt.

                         WILL
          We're visiting a place called "The
          Ranch". They have animals.

                         CAESAR
          Real animals?

                         WILL
          You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas, orangutans...
          Caesar GRUNTS, excited.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It'll be good. You'll like it very
          much.
          Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.

                         CAESAR
          Will sad?

                         WILL
          What? No, I'm fine.

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the
          window.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE
          AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic
          countryside.
          A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all
          cold, efficient structures.

                         CAESAR
          Where animals?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Will sees the PRIMATE CAGES in the distance, next to a GIANT

          RED METAL ATRIUM.

                         WILL
          Inside, I think...

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As they climb from the car, MR. LANDON, 50's, emerges from
          the office. DODGE, 20's, hangs back.

                         WILL
          You must be Mr. Landon.

                         (SHAKING HANDS)
          This is Caesar.

          MR. LANDON
          Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is
          Dodge, helps me run the place.

                         WILL
          I've been telling Caesar about the
          animals you have here. How much
          fun it is.

          MR. LANDON
          Yes, we have a big play center
          where the chimpanzees like to
          climb.

                         (TO CAESAR)
          Want to see the play center?
          Caesar nods. Absolutely.

          EXT. CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          A HUGE CAGED STRUCTURE, the size of a gymnasium. Inside are
          climbing constructions, ropes, toys, and, in the middle, a
          LARGE TREE, reaching up through the top bars.
          A CAGED-IN BRIDGE leads to a row of DARK DENS. But for
          now... it's empty. No apes in sight.
          Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.

          MR. LANDON
          What do you think, Caesar? Want to
          give it a try?
          Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's
          harness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         WILL
          Go ahead.
          He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-

          LIKE SLIDING DOOR.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings
          from bar to bar, then hits the ground and runs for the tree.

          EXT. OUTSIDE CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,

          LOCKING IT.
          He braces himself.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE
          TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the
          bars, but HE'S REACHED...

          A DEAD END.
          CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes
          gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.

          HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.

          HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.
          Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
          Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from
          UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.
          The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to
          the gate, tries to shake it open.

                         WILL
          It's okay, Caesar. It's going to
          be okay...
          The words are for him as much as Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You're going to live here for a
          while. This is what the Judge says
          we have to do.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He
          frantically signs, desperate, pleading.
          The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
          apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
          bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          They'll take good care of you here.

                         DODGE
          That's about it for visiting hours.
          Will shoots him a look of daggers.

          MR. LANDON
          What Dodge means is, in our
          experience, longer you drag out the
          leave-taking, harder it is. On
          both of you.
          Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
          doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry to trick you this way,
          but you would never have agreed. I
          was afraid they'd hurt you if they
          forced you -

          MR. LANDON
          He'll be fine.
          Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is
          matched only by Caesar's.
          WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.
          Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a

          CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.

          CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.

                         DODGE
          Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.
          Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          This way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then
          through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.
          Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.
          He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          .the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.
          This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor
          area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND

          THEIR CAGES.

                         DODGE
          Caesar - over here.
          Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for
          salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE

          REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.
          He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.

          CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Stupid monkey.

          FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS

          THE BETRAYAL.
          Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to
          the ceiling, searching for a way out.
          To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES
          pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:

          THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW
          THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property...

          EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          .and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road,
          away from the Ranch.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER

          Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.
          Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the
          cage, heavy head resting on his arms.
          He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
          followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
          In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR

          CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD

          ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
          This is ROCKET.
          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage
          floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.
          He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
          challenging eye to Caesar.

          SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!
          A terrifying display of power and dominance.

          DODGE (O.S.)
          Okay, assholes. Dinner time.
          Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening
          look to Caesar - moves off.
          Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
          an occasional rotted vegetable.
          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
          looking dog food.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
          Bet you don't get none of that in
          the suburbs.
          Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
          IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Think that's funny? That funny to
          you, you hairy prick?
          Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.

                         RODNEY
          Look at that!
          Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.

                         DODGE
          One thing you can count on: Long as
          there are humans on this earth,
          you'll always be a monkey in a
          cage.
          The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.
          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
          floor.

                         RODNEY
          What about his clothes? Might
          cause problems with the other apes.

                         DODGE
          Leave 'em.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's
          swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard.
           The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY

          Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on
          the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games,
          etc. The newspaper's unread beside him.

           WALTER (O.S.)
           John?
           Walter enters, looks at Will.

                         9

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          John - where's Caesar?
          The old man looks stricken.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't
          there something we can do?
          Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea.

          INT. LAB CAFETERIA - DAY

          WE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria.
          He's shaved, pulled himself together.
          Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.
          He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming.
          Will slides into the seat across from him.

                         JACOBS
          You've been gone a week.

                         WILL
          I was sick.

                         JACOBS
          Too sick to return my calls? You
          know it was a funny thing, but I
          was watching the news and they
          started talking about a seven-year-
          old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
          all of a sudden, there you were on
          the TV. A seven year old chimp,
          raised since birth.
          The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
          voice. Neither man cares.

                         WILL
          He's the son of chimp 4. And he's
          smart. Off-the-charts smart.
          Because of the 112. The genetic
          therapy was passed in utero - from
          the mother to the son. Without a
          single negative side-effect.

                         JACOBS
          Aside from biting off a man's
          finger.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         WILL
          He was protecting my father. The
          same way his mother was protecting
          him.

                         JACOBS
          We've had this conversation
          already. We knew the 112 was
          making the apes smart -

                         WILL

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          I tried the 112 on my father.
          A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the
          effect Will was after.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I had a sample vial.

                         JACOBS
          You're out of your mind.
          Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit
          there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.

                         WILL
          Don't you want to know if it
          worked?
          Jacobs can't resist...

                         JACOBS
          Did it?

                         WILL
          It was miraculous. Unquestionable
          adult neurogenesis - development of
          fresh nerve tissue.

                         (BEAT)
          It brought my father back.
          But Jacobs is confused.

                         JACOBS
          You told me he was failing.

                         WILL
          It's just like with the mice.
          Alzheimer's is a progressive
          disease, you need to keep it at bay
          â¢ - you need boosters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the
          possibilities. The money.

                         JACOBS
          Why have you waited so long to tell
          me this?

                         WILL
          I couldn't risk losing him.

                         JACOBS
          'Him'?

                         WILL
          Caesar.

                         JACOBS
          The ape?
          Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.

                         WILL
          We've discovered a safe treatment.
          It's the payday you've been waiting
          for. I'll recreate the primate
          version of 112 for you.

                         (BEAT)
          But only under one condition.
          It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.

                         JACOBS
          You're giving me conditions? I
          could have you arrested for what
          you've done.

                         WILL
          But you won't - you need me to
          build the drug. Here's what I
          need: I want you to get Caesar
          back.

                         JACOBS

                         (THROWN)
          How the hell can I do that?

                         WILL
          However they do things in your part
          of the world. Get attorneys into
          it. Write checks. Slip cash into
          the right pockets.
          (pausing for emphasis)
          Make it happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNING

          Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
          He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
          are empty - that his cage door is open.
          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING

          Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.

          EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING

           Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE

                         BRIDGE:
          THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
          toward the atrium.
          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
          orangutans with orangutans.
          They haven't noticed him yet.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
          notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED

          LIKE A HUMAN.

          HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN

          EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE

          MORE UPRIGHT...
          Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.
          Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
          tosses it to Rocket.
          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.

          AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET

          SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
          across the face.
          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...

          .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
          BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
          Caesar starts to move off -

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF

          CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.
          Out cold.

          INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY

          Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
          His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
          now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,

          PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
          It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
          Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
          restrained to a medical table.
          Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.

                         VOICE
          Caesar.
          Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.

                         STEWART
          Do you remember me? I'm Dr.
          Stewart.
          She hands him a cup of water with a straw.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Drink.
          Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly
          doesn't understand. He signs again.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I don't understand.
          Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW
          SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak?

                         STEWART (CONT-D)
          Can you show me? Show me what you
          need.
          Caesar pulls at the restraints.

                          STEWART (CONT'D)
           I can't take those off.
           Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry this has happened,
          Caesar. So sorry.
          Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his
          emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm here once a week. I'll do my
          best to look after you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

          Dodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking
          them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and--
          Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair.

          STEWART (O.S.)
          What were you thinking?

                         DODGE
          oh, hey Doc.

                         STEWART
          That chimp needs protection.
          Dodge's face falls.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You could've gotten him killed.

                         DODGE

                         (A LIE)
          I told Rodney not to open his cage.

                         STEWART
          Can't you see how sensitive he is?
          How intelligent?

                         DODGE
          Yeah, no, he's a real smart
          dresser.

                         STEWART
          I want him moved to the orangutan
          house. He'll be safe there until
          we re-introduce him to the group.

                         DODGE
          I'm sorry, since when do volunteer
          animal doctors make the rules
          around here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         STEWART
          Please. Just do it.

                         DODGE
          Whatever you say, doc.
          Dodge returns to stacking the chow.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          You're the one with the college
          education.

          INT. 'VIRUS FACTORY', GEN-SYS LABS - DAY

          A spinning machine, test tubes, a giant propagation tank.
          Empty canisters labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
          REVEAL WILL in the doorway, watching it all very carefully.
          A VIRUS TECHNICIAN approaches him. He's tentative, nervous.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a
          mistake.
          Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it
          took so long to come up.

          VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
          I've double-checked the replication
          rate of the 113 - and it's
          enormously fast compared to the

          112.

                         WILL
          That's why we're using it. We need
          the drug quickly.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          But... isn't it risky? I mean, at
          this rate of propagation, we
          greatly increase the possibility of
          mutations that are out of our
          control. It's a highly unstable -

                         WILL
          I appreciate your concern - but
          it's going to be fine. We plan on
          taking precautions.
          The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's
          look tells him the conversation is over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          BEEP BEEP BEEP...

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES -- DAY

           A large truck backs onto a loading dock. Will watches as a
           NEW GROUP OF CHIMPANZEES are unloaded from the truck and
          brought into the lab.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Will's in his sweats, working. DOORBELL.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Will opens the door to FIND STEWART STANDING THERE. For a
          moment he's too shocked to say anything.

                         STEWART
          Sorry to drop in on you like this.
          The clinic at the zoo gave me your
          address but they didn't have a
          phone number -

                         WILL

                         (RECOVERING)
          Don't worry about it. You want to
          come in?

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They stand awkwardly by the door. She looks great.

                          WILL
          Can I - you want a cup of coffee or
          something?

                         STEWART
          No - thanks. I just wanted to let
          you know that I've seen Caesar.
          Seen Caesar?

                         WILL
          How?

                         STEWART
          I volunteer once a week at The
          Ranch.

                         WILL
          Is he alright?
          She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         STEWART
          Yeah. He had a rough start, but
          things should get smoother from now
          on...
          In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will
          follows Stewart's curious gaze.

                         WILL
          That's my dad. He's not doing too
          well.

                         STEWART
          Oh. Sorry.

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay.
          I'm looking after him.

                         WILL
          Thank you... I appreciate that.
          Awkward beat.

                         STEWART
          Well. If you give me your number
          I'll let you know from time to time
          how things are going -

                         WILL
          Let's grab a drink.
          Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too.
          She's happy he asked.

                         STEWART
          Love to.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Nighttime.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up
          and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the
          orangutans sleep.
          ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,
          windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in
          his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
          40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.

                         DODGE
          Want a beer?
          The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Here's a little taste of beer...
          He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH.
          Caesar watches, disgusted.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING


          A LEVER THROWN OPEN.
          Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages
          in succession.
          Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE

          ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.

                         DODGE & RODNEY
          Move it! Let's go!
          Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
          ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
          across the bridge.
          On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
          ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
          then moves off to join the others.
          Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
          Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
          push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
          arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS

          HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
          Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
          Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
          alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
          Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
          Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S

          CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to
          contain his excitement.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
          on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
          appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's
          clearly thrilled to see him.

                         WILL
          There you are! I heard what
          happened.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home now. Caesar home.
          He tugs Will away from Dodge.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get you out of here,
          but not today. I'm working on it.
          Caesar's face falls.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Soon. I promise.
          Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home.
          Still a question, a flicker of hope.

                         WILL
          (kills him to say it)
          Not yet. I can't yet.
          Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
          First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
           starts walking back to his cage.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Wait a second - Caesar, where are
          you going?
          â¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
          Dodge catches up with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         DODGE
          (loud enough for Will)
          No place like home, huh monkey boy?

                         WILL
          Caesar - come back here!
          He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside
          him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY

          Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

           .storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front
          of the office... just as -
          BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
          ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he
          might've just broken his hand.

                         WILL
          You son of a bitch.
          Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.

                         DODGE
          That was not a smart thing to do.
          Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
          too angry to care.

                         WILL
          If I find out Caesar's been hurt,
          if he's mistreated in any way, I
          swear I'll have you brought up on
          charges.
          Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.

                         DODGE
          That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours
          any more. He's mine now.
          The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          And you're on private property.
          Now get the hell out of here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         WILL
          Forget jail. I'll come back and
          kill you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - LATER

          A bag of CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. Caesar - looking morose -
          watches as Rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the
          bag into the shed...

          STEWART (O.S.)
          Morning Caesar.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.

                         STEWART
          How's your arm? Mind if I take a
          look?
          Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
          PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Looking good...
          Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
          She pulls a harness from her bag.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm taking him out. Thought I'd
          cheer him up, show him the horses.

                         DODGE
          No way.
          As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.

                         STEWART
          What are you going to do? Use a
          cattle prod on me?

                         DODGE
          If you're into that kind of thing.

                         STEWART
          I'm safer with him than I am with
          you.

                         DODGE
          Answer's no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.
          Stewart turns to Caesar, who's retreated onto a bed of straw.

                         STEWART
          I can't take you.
          (glancing at Dodge)
          Maybe another time.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.
          Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
          SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
          He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
          he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
          them and extending them end to end.
          Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
          shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
          They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
          Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."
          Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.
          Caesar returns to crafting the tool.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Dark FORMS in cages, illuminated by GREEN FLUORESCENT LIGHT.
          The DOOR OPENS. EYES OPEN, HEADS TURN.
          Will enters - WE SEE THAT HIS HAND HIS BANDAGED.
          The apes watch as he walks along the cages, eyes searching
          the dark chimpanzee faces.

          EACH LAB CHIMP HAS A DIFFERENT COLORED IDENTIFICATION WRIST

          BAND.

                         WILL
          Which one of you wants chocolate...
          Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.
          NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE

          ARM EXTENDS FROM A CAGE, PALM UP - WITH A RED BAND.
          Will walks to the cage, chimp #11, reads the label beside it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          "Koba."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          He peers inside. Koba stares back, EYES MURKY AND SMALL

          BENEATH A HEAVILY PROTRUDING BROW, DARKENED PIGMENTATION

          STREAKS DOWN EACH CHEEK. A SINISTER FACE.
          He DROPS AN M&M INTO KOBA'S PALM. Eyes on Will, Koba secrets
          it to a "storage spot" inside the cage.
          Then he puts out his hand again.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Nanotherapy, beta version: Male
          Test Subject Number eleven.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Koba doesn't resist as Will straps him to the table.
          He watches as a HANDLER -- EVANS - moves into the next room,
          opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and
          pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
           Evans and Will each slip on HAZMAT masks, making sure they're
          secure. Then Evans hands the 113 to Will.
           All of this avidly taken in by Koba's dark eyes.
          Will inserts the adenovirus 113 nozzle into a plastic oxygen
          mask.
          Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the
          chimp's face.

                         EVANS

                         (THROUGH MASK)
          Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he?
          Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO

          KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH.

          THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE.

          INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will
          sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of
          dress (or undress) that they've been intimate.
          Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time
          with the chopsticks.

                         STEWART
          You actually punched him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         WILL
          I did.
          She thinks it's funny.

                         STEWART
          I've been wanting to do that since
          the day I met him.

                         WILL
          I don't advise it. My hand's
          killing me.

                         STEWART
          Here. Let me help you out.
          She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his
          chopsticks.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get him out of there.

                         STEWART
          I know you are.

                         WILL
          And I'm going to get my dad back
          too.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a
          THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its
          end, finger holes sticking out. Finished.
          Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE

          CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH.
          He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps
          trying... until finally the loop's in place.
          Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS.
          He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches.
          Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM

          INTO THE NIGHT.

          EXT. BRIDGE AREA - NIGHT

          Caesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to
          the chimpanzee house - and keeps going.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - NIGHT

          He arrives at the Gorilla House.
          Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar
          unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door.
          He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep.
          Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly...

          INT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT

          .enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla.
          From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest
          rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles
          his toe.
          There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar
          finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.
          Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
           Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he
           doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on,
          let's go."
           Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him...

          EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          .across the bridge...

          EXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT

          .and into the atrium. Caesar follows.
          The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing
          structure.
          The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step.
          Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the
          way across the atrium, then all the way back.
          Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom.
          Caesar stands back, silently watching.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - MORNING

          A morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine:
          0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          He makes his way to the ape houses.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - MORNING

          Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer
          and closer to the cage... until they're right in front.
          The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate
          chow into the gorilla's trough.

          BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS

          HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - MORNING

          Caesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's
          beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN

          DOES SOMETHING REMARKABLE: HE USES SIGN LANGUAGE.

                         MAURICE
          Happy gorilla.
          Caesar's shocked.

                         MAURICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.

                         CAESAR
          Signing orangutan.

                         MAURICE
          Maurice circus orangutan.

                         CAESAR
          More ape sign?

                         MAURICE
          No. Maurice alone.
          They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.

                         CAESAR
          Careful. Stupid human no like
          smart ape.
          Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs.
          Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. Pieces of primate chow hit him in the head.
          He wakes with a start. SEES THAT HIS CAGE DOOR IS OPEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Rocket gets to his feet, sees CAESAR STANDING IN THE COMMON

          AREA.
          Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee
          common area - toward the door -
          Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S

          PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.

          ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.

          HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A

          MOUNTAIN: BUCK.
          Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;
          Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it
          SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.
          The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
          Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.

          STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE

          SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -

          OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.
          A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.
          Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
          at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND

          LOCKS HIM IN.
          Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
          eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with
          his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.

          CHIMPANZEE HOUSE HAS A NEW ALPHA MALE.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will and Evans (the handler) are wearing hazmat masks as they
          administer Adenovirus 113 to chimp after chimp.
          Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.
          They lead Koba to the table. Koba knows what to do. He lies
          down, allows himself to be strapped in.
          All routine. Everyone's guard is down.
          But as soon as the BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST is released, KOBA

          â¢ THRASHES OUT AN ARM, HITTING EVANS IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         WILL
          Hold him steady!
          Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.

          WE SEE THAT EVANS' MASK HAS BEEN KNOCKED ASKEW.
          Will finishes administering the drug. Koba goes limp on the
          table.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You okay Evans?

                         EVANS
          Yeah. I'm good.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will demonstrates the "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle. Koba watches.

                         WILL
          You can't put larger blocks on top
          of smaller ones.
          (pointing to right side)
          Move the stack from here to here.
          Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,

          SO THAT THE LEFT STACK IS INDEED NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
          Will looks at Koba. Koba looks back.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          You've got to take the blocks off
          and stack them again, like this.
          Will turns the puzzle back around.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Let's see you try.
          Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&M.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I'll give you an M&M if you can get
          the blocks to the other side - but
          don't do it the way you did last
          time.
          Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME
          COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Ingenious in its own way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You know what I want. You're just
          not going to give it to me.
          Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,

          DISQUIETING.

          AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK

          SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN...

          WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          What do you think of Koba?

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

           We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far
          away, across the room.

                          FRANKLIN
           You wanna know if I think the 113's
           making him nuts.

                         WILL
          I know he's smart. But there's
          something else, something
          worrisome. He challenges me.
          Taunts me.
          Will looks toward us, toward the bars.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (almost to himself)
          I don't want to try it on...

                         (CATCHES HIMSELF)
          .I don't want to start human
          trials if there's any chance of
          danger.

                         FRANKLIN
          What you're seeing has nothing to
          do with the 113, Doc. The apes're
          just like us - they're complex.
          Some are loyal, some are selfish,
          some have a good sense of humor.
          And some are born rotten.
          Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of
          view, from inside the cage.
          Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his
          â¢ face frame the two men across the room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          This one's a bad apple, that's all.
          A chill runs down Will's spine.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY

          A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill.

                         GUARD

                         (OPENING GATE)
          Early day today, Evans?

                         EVANS
          Actually I'm not feeling too good.

          EVANS GETS A SHIVER.

                         GUARD
          You know what: Whiskey, lemon,
          honey and a cup of hot water.
          Never fails.

                         EVANS
          Thanks - I'm on it.
          Evans drives off.

          EXT. PADDOCK - DAY

          Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at
          the chimpanzee area.
          She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves
          easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the
          others make way for him.
          Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar
          so at ease with the other apes.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the
          bars.

                         RODNEY
          Still won't eat, won't come out.

                         DODGE
          I can fix that.
          Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get that monkey ass out of there!

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't
          struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.
          Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never
          seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes
          a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.
          At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.
          Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a
          cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT

          Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...
          But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla.
          No shovel.
          He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.
          Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,

          OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.
          CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.
          Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar
          makes a motion with his hand.
          Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest
          chimp. Then another one. Then another.
          The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND

          ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE

          MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.
          Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment
          of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.
          Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the
          orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck
          immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big
          â¢ party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
           Caesar watches, satisfied, as the apes feast together.

          EXT. ATRIUM/TREE - DAY

          Caesar sits high in the tree, looking down at the apes.
          Rocket's part of the group again, but no longer the Alpha.
          Caesar's got his eye on CORNELIA, a FEMALE APE, standing with
          a group of females. He follows her movements with his
          eyes...
          Maurice climbs up next to Caesar.

                         MAURICE
          Why cookie Rocket?

                         CAESAR
          Need strong. All apes strong.

                         MAURICE
          No understand.
          Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.

                         CAESAR
          Gorilla.
          He breaks another twig.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Orangutan.
          He breaks another.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Chimpanzee.
          He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they
          can't be broken.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Apes.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Establishing shot. A beautiful morning.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Will's getting ready for his day. Hair wet from the shower,
          buttoning up his shirt, he pauses to pour himself a cup of
          coffee, look up at the clock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          He takes a sip, heads down the hall to his father's room.

                         WILL
          Someone's sleeping late today -
          Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Dad?

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          LONG SHOT of Will sitting at a gravesite service, surrounded
          by twenty-odd PEOPLE. WE RECOGNIZE Stewart, Jacobs, one of
          the Aides.

          EXT. RANCH - DAY

          Will waits at the picnic table. He's been there a while.
          Finally Rodney appears.

                         RODNEY
          Sorry - can't get him to come out.
          He won't budge.

                         WILL
          He knows I'm here?

                         RODNEY
          I told him.
          Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.

                         RODNEY (CONT'D)
          Hey - you are not allowed back

                         THERE -
          Will ignores him, keeps going.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar sees Will coming. He turns his back, heads to a
          common area away from the bars.
          Will runs up to the cage.

                         WILL
          Caesar - please! I've got
          something to tell you -

                         (BEAT)
          It's about Walter.

                         Â¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s
          heard Will's words.
          Will waits. Caesar's not coming out.

          NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
          NASA has temporarily lost
          communication with the Icarus.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Will sits with a glass of Scotch, watching TV. Stewart's
          looking at a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.

                         NEWSCASTER
          Captain Taylor and his crew are
          navigating the ship around the dark
          side of Mars. Communication is
          expected to be reestablished -

                         WILL
          I was too late.
          She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.

                         STEWART
          You tried. You worked really hard.
          Walter knew that.

                         WILL
          Wasn't good enough though, was it.
          ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his
          two teenage sons...

          INT. LAB - NIGHT

          Franklin's on the phone.

                         FRANKLIN
          Just checking in. You didn't show
          up at work today.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. EVANS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Crummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR
          FRANKLIN'S VOICE through the phone machine.

          FRANKLIN (O.S.)
          Hope you're feeling better - let me
          know if you need anything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried
          blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless
          eye.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice
          grabs his arm.

                         MAURICE
          Where go?

                         CAESAR
          Find Mother.

          EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT

          Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the

          GATE.
          As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL
          OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to
          go with him.
          Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.
          To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he
          gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S

          EYES HAVE CHANGED.
          Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
          Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE

          UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.
          Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he
          remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the
          wound on his arm, now nearly healed.
          Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?
          Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for
          anything.

          EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living
          â¢ quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Middle of the night, only a few cars.
          Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for
          a break in traffic, cross the highway.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

          In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the
          night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

          Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.

          SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE
          A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.
          Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the
          suburban street.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE.

          CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK.
          WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that?

          CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK.
          It's coming from outside.
          REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,
          moves to the window, looks into the back yard.

          THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.
          Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.
          Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.

          THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.
          It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the
          darkness.
          He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.
          His face is impossible to read.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter
          along the mantle.
          Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the
          hallway.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the
          doorway, taking it in.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from
          Will's house.

          EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY
          GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.
          Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a
          spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE
          AIR, head toward the Primate House.

          INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT

          The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his
          shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two
          chimpanzees run across the grounds.

          EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries
          the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW
          OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.
          Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.
          Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to
          the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in
          through the window.
          Rocket follows.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT

          Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on
          the office computer - doesn't hear anything.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET
          drop to the cement floor.
          Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED
          FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into
          each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.

          A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED

          BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.

          IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.
          Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH

          KOBA.

          HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.

          THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES

          SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
          Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
          Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand.
          Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED

          IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

          KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING

          HIS CAGE.

          ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.
          ANGLE ON Caesar.
          He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the

          DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.
          These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.

          NO CONNECTION.
          Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,
          stares back at him.
          Caesar turns away, crestfallen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB
          CHIMPS start to SCREAM.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

           HEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads...

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          .into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.

          KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.
          They stare at each other.
          Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on
          his nightly rounds.
          They look at each other, lay low.
          To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED

          SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-

          TALKIE.
          But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.

          EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off
          together.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S

          KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.
          Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes
          behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.
          Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night
          swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,
          oblivious.
          Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.

           INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and
          â¢ closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          CLICK. It locks into place.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING

          Dawn of a new day.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING

          Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's
          face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.
          Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING

          Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still
          asleep.
          There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.
          Caesar freezes.
          Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the
          shovel. Locks the door behind him.
          He hasn't seen Caesar yet.

                         DODGE
          Rise and shine, assholes.
          The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in
          the common area.

          THEN DODGE SEES HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          What the hell -
          (seeing Cornelia's open

                         CAGE)
          You sly son of a bitch. How'd you
          do that?
          Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds
          it in front of him.
          He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're gonna go slow here, alright?
          You're gonna go back in your cage,
          you're not going to give me no
          trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,
           riveted, waiting to see what will happen.
          Cornelia stands, watching.
          Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is
          unreadable.
          Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL

          AGAINST THE BARS.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Back!
          Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.
          Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,
          Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.
          Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward
          the orangutan cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're going to have you fixed,
          Einstein, that's for damn sure...
          But first we're going to figure out
          how you pulled this off...

          CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Go on. Get in that cage.
          Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          I said get!
          But Caesar doesn't move.
          Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement
          floor.
          He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
          handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get in that cage, you damn dirty
          ape!

          â¢ CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL

          HEIGHT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          THEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH

          TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.

                         CAESAR
          (with his voice)
          No!

          STUNNED SILENCE.

          THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING.
          Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance.
          Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word.
          Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded,
          trying to comprehend what has just happened.
          And then... they go nuts.

           SCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
           That's when Caesar attacks.
           He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.
           Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN

           THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
          Dodge staggers back.
          Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.
          Dodge crumples forward.

          CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.
          Lights out.
          Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.
          Rocket helps pull him inside.

          THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE

          APES COME STREAMING OUT.
          They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS

          AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.
          Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts
          out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE

          SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO

          HANDS TOGETHER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices
          the palm and places his hand against it.
          Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest
          and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.
          And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

          OPEN PALMS WAITING.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.

          INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

          He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He
          pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.
          Strange.

          THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.
          Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES

          CAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED.
          He stands there, stunned.

          JACOBS (O.S.)
          Will? Hello? Will pick up the
          goddamned phone!

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING


                         WILL
          Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB.

                         JACOBS
          The animal handler - Franklin - was
          killed last night. In the primate
          house.

                         WILL
          Franklin's dead?

                         JACOBS
          Something very powerful broke his
          neck. Snapped it in two.

                         WILL
          Could it have been one of our
          chimps?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JACOBS
          All our apes are accounted for - â¢
          secured in their cages. But here's
          the kicker: One of our security
          guards swears he chased a
          chimpanzee off the grounds last
          night.
          Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's
          swing.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          Where in the hell did that chimp
          come from?!

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE -- MORNING

          Will speeds out of the driveway, Stewart by his side. She's
          dialing her cell phone.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Mr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas.

          MR. LANDON
          The Ranch. Landon speaking.

                         (LISTENING)
          Hey Stewart.

                         (LISTENING)
          Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast
          about half an hour ago...
          He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and
          ape houses. Can't see anything wrong.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Let me call you back...
          He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the
          kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Hey Dodge - Stewart just called -
          WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the...

          INT. RANCH/KITCHEN - MORNING

          .kitchen.

          MR. LANDON
          She said that -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE

          STANDING IN THE KITCHEN.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - MORNING

          The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses.
          Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will's car speeds up to the gate and stops.

                         STEWART

                         (ON PHONE)
          No one's answering.
          In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch
          house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is
          visible.
          Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.

                         WILL
          You go get help.

                         STEWART
          Not a way in the world. I'm coming
          with you.

          EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

           They sneak into the back of the ranch house. All is quiet.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

          But once inside, the level of destruction is immediately
          visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed,
          cupboards emptied.

                         STEWART
          Oh my God... I'm calling 911..
          Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window.
          HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE,
          LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES.

          AND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          .CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control.

                         WILL
          Caesar.
          Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's
          trembling.

                         STEWART
          It's going to take them at least
          half an hour to get here.
          He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an
          empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a
          couple of stray COOKIES.
          He has an idea.
          Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                         WILL
          I'm going to kill him.

                         STEWART

                         (HORRIFIED)
          Caesar?

                         WILL
          He's dangerous.

                         STEWART
          You're wrong - he can't have been
          the one who killed that man -

                         WILL
          There is no other explanation.
          A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart
          turns. Now there's another.
          They're surrounded. She SCREAMS.
          Will barricades the back door with a table.
          Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.

          GLASS SHATTERS.
          Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door

          CRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

           INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY


                          WILL
           Caesar! I need to talk to you!
           Dodge, Rodney and Landon watch as Will and Stewart are pushed
          into the cage next door.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Caesar!

                         DODGE
          Welcome to the mad house.

                         STEWART
          I called Animal Control - they'll
          be here soon -

                         WILL
          (through the bars)
          I just want to talk to you!

                         DODGE
          Well this'll be interesting because
          your freak'll talk back.

                         RODNEY
          Dodge thinks he spoke to him.

                         DODGE
          He did! He said the word "no" -
          right to my face.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         DODGE
          He can talk.

                         STEWART
          That's impossible.

                         DODGE
          Then he must have a voicebox in his
          ass, because I heard him!
          Caesar walks up.
           Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED
          COOKIE is ready.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         WILL
          Caesar - people are coming. People
          with guns. You've got to make the
          apes go back in their cages.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Apes no belong in cage. Human put
          apes in cage.
          Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent.
          He means what he's saying.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

                         (SIGNING)
          Never again.
          Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST

          BE DONE.
          Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds
          it out.

                         WILL
          I brought this for you.
          Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (it's killing him)
          Don't you want it?

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Never.
          They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but
          now with a vast chasm between them.

                         WILL
          You went to the lab last night. I
          know it was you.
          Caesar doesn't deny it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (emotion spilling over)
          How could you kill that man,
          Caesar? Once you kill you can't it
          back - that man's gone forever.

          WILL SEES A GENUINE LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT CROSS CAESAR'S FACE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          It gives him pause.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill.

                         WILL
          But...

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill!
          Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand.
           Rocket immediately comes over to stand by Caesar, but Caesar
          doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will.
          He turns, begins to walk off.

                         WILL
          Don't walk away. We need to talk.

          CORNELIA FALLS IN STEP WITH CAESAR, BUT PAUSES TO SNIFF AT

          THE COOKIE ON THE GROUND.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Don't - !

          TOO LATE - SHE GOBBLES IT UP.

          FOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE,

          AND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED

          AROUND KOBA'S ARM.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (SHOCKED)
          Where'd he get that wristband,
          Caesar? That's Koba's band...

                         (REALIZING)
          Did Koba get out of his cage??
           Yelling after Caesar.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Caesar wait!
           But Caesar's not waiting.

           EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

           Caesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick-up truck.
          â¢ Apes gather around, expectant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         CAESAR

                         (VOICE STRAINING)
          No.
          At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall.
          FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          C...Cage!
          The humans' jaws drop, petrified.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

          NO CAGE! NO MORE'.

          CAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA.

          THE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN.
          BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED.

          APES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH.
          Will - and the other humans - are blown away.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          The pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate
          and moves out over the countryside.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          ANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the
          ranch.

                         VOICE
          They could be spread out all over
          the County by now.
          Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER
          HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby.

                         WILL
          No - they'll stick together.

                         DODGE

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          They're following one ape. You
          kill him, you stop them all.

                         HUFFS
          There's a leader?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         DODGE

                         (POINTING)
          Ask him - he raised him.
          All eyes to Will.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. If I can
          reason with him, I know I can put
          an end to this.

                         HUFFS
          Reason with him?
          Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad
          car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel.

                         WILL
          You don't understand - this chimp
          is smart - he'll listen to me

                         HUFF
          (to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER)
          Get on the horn with every agency
          you can think of! We've got to
          track down these monkeys before
          they do major damage!
          The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge
          follows.

                         DODGE
          You need me riding with you. I've
          got experience with these animals.
          (eye on Will)
          I can point out the one you want.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DAY

          An AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front.
          Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS.

                         OFFICER
          (handing Jacobs a card)
          If you think of anything else, this
          is where I can be reached -
          A RUMBLING SOUND from behind.
          They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way.
          Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can.

                         Â¢
          The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Caesar and his chimps BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.
          No time is wasted. Cages are opened, LAB CHIMPS liberated.
          Koba steps from his cage slowly, measuring the situation as
          apes around him go crazy.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          A stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie-talkie.

                         OFFICER
          We have a situation at Gen-Sys
          Laboratory! Approximately two
          dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know
          what the hell they are -
          AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,

          DESTRUCTION.

          INT. MOVING SQUAD CAR - DAY

          Huffs drives - Will in the front, Stewart in back. They can
          hear everything through the radio.

                         WILL
          The lab.

                         HUFFS
          You know anything about this?

                         WILL
          That's where I work.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE/TREATMENT ROOMS- DAY

          ANARCHY OF MOVEMENT, BLURS of BLACK FUR running amok through
          white rooms, tearing everything up.
          EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind
          desks.

          ANGLE ON REFRIGERATED CANISTERS OF 113.
          Like everything else in the lab, torn down, stomped on,
          thrown against the wall.
          Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled
          behind a squad car. Other Employees are hiding and watching
          from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize
          that everything has GONE SILENT.
          A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.

                         OFFICER #1
          Here they come!

          A MASS OF PRIMATES BARREL TOWARD THEM.

                         OFFICER #2
          There's more of them!

                         JACOBS

                         (REALIZING)
          Those are my chimps...
          They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over
          the car they're crouched behind.
           BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad
          car - and their heads.
          The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use
          Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE.
          The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car.
          And then they're gone. Every last one of them.
          Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and
          devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive
          party.
          Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON

          BROKEN GLASS.
          Jacobs freezes.
          KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at
          each other for a long moment.
           Then Koba calmly walks past him.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Once outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through
          the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others
          Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING

          THAT GOES LOUDLY ROLLING ALONG THE CEMENT FLOOR.

          IT'S A CRUMPLED CANISTER OF ADENOVIRUS 113. THE NOZZLE'S

          BROKEN OFF.

          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

          Four HELICOPTERS wait. Hoff s, Will and Stewart climb into
          one of them.

          INT. ASCENDING HELICOPTER - DAY


                         HOFFS
          Any idea where they're headed?
          Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter
          below. He doesn't like it.

                         WILL
          No.

                         HOFFS
          They were seen heading north from
          the lab - let's start with that.

          EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

          A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG
          moving in.
          KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.
          A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a
          bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands.

                         GIRL
          Monkey!
          OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then
          another. And another.

          REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR

          WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.
          suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.

          PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS.
          The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)
          Mommy?
          The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't
          get to her.

                         MOTHER
          April!
          Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up
          and puts her down out of harm's way.
          Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where
          he's going.
          SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat,
          looking down at the city below.

                         HUFFS
          You see them?

                         WILL
          No, I can't see -

                          STEWART
          Oh my god.
          Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW:
          it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl -
          chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along
          parallel streets...
          She realizes something.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I know where they're going.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY


          A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO.
          FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors.
          The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping
          low overhead. Faces turn skyward...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos.
          PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM.
          Released balloons float lazily upward.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways,
          dodging people, jumping over benches.

                         WILL
          He's going to release the apes.
          Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off -
          but hesitate.
          The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS.
          Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth.

          INT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO/APE ENCLOSURE - DAY


                         WRANGLER
          What the hell am I supposed to do
          when they get here?!
          An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape
          Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know
          something's coming.
          Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers,
          turns to see Caesar and his apes.
          Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth.
          The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys.

          SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN.

           INT./EXT. APE ENCLOSURE/ZOO - DAY

          All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from
           their separate enclosures.
           Caesar's apes are waiting for them.
           Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE
          CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY.
          Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some
          News Crews.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the
          street.

          That's him! The one with the white

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY

          Apes leap over cars, run in and out of traffic. PEDESTRIANS
          take cover.
          SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS.
          Caesar's leading, running alongside Cornelia. She falters.
          Caesar slows with her, concerned.
          SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her
          speed.
          Caesar continues on.

          INT. HELICOPTER- DAY

          Will's plastered to the window, anxiously watching Caesar's
          progress.
          Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown
          larger, but they stay together, moving implacably North
          through the San Francisco streets.
          Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic,
          shimmering in the afternoon light.
          And Will realizes the moment he sees it.

                         WILL
          They're going to Muir Woods.
          (turning to Huffs)
          I'm sure of it. He doesn't want to

          The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a
          stampeding phalanx with Caesar at the lead.
          But Cornelia can't keep up any more. Losing her balance, she
          stumbles, falls.
          Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches
          her, she's dead - a WHITE FOAM has formed at her lips.
          She's been poisoned.

          WILL. THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT.
          Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's
          going to carry her across the bridge.
          Other helicopters BUZZ low, SHOTS RING OUT, SIRENS CLOSE IN.
          Apes take cover around trees and structures, but they're

          TRAFFIC slams to a halt.
          PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER
          THEIR CARS, run down the middle of the traffic - stampeding
          across the bridge.
          Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to
          get a safe shot.

          AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped.
          A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles
          ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS,

          THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.

          DODGE IS AMONG THEM.

          AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Caesar and his apes race forward.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream
          Northward, over and around stopped cars.

                         HUFFS

                         (INTO HEADSET)
          Tell them to hold their fire until
          they get past the traffic!
          WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a
          place on the bridge where there are no more cars.
          Then they'll be open season.
           Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the
          north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot
          behind them.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the
          bridge traffic.
          Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad
          cars.
          He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION

          CABLES.
          Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE.
          Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and
          swirls hundreds of feet below.
          Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,
          taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.
          Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
          with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
          Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into
          the fog. Rocket's right behind.
          The remaining apes follow.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.
          Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of
          fog.
          Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
          And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled
          traffic.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck
          apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end.

                         ABOVE BRIDGE
          Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at
          the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.
          They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND

          SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.
          A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.
          A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH
          the chimp hits the water.
          They keep moving.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The
          Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.

          DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND

          LOADS.
          They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
          apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
          BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
          Another chimp falls to its death.
          Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
          of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
          practically zero.

          NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM

          IN THE FOG.

                         OFFICER
          They're all around us!
          Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -

          WHOOSH...
          DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
          of some visibility.
          That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,

          CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.

          WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
          There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
          the fog.
          He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
          cable.
          ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
          AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
          Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES

          CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.

          ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR

          UP.
          Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO

          THE MAIN CABLE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          BAM!
          Rocket's hit in the back!
          He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE

          BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
          Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
          But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON

          THE BRIDGE.
          The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD

          THE BARRICADE.
          Like a freight train of menacing power.
          Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
          back up.
          A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
          And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
          MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
          Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
          waged above is audible.
          He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.

                         AERIAL VIEW
          As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON

          CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND

          APES SCAMPERING BELOW.
          Vanquishing the humans.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND

          CARS.

          BUCK'S EYES ARE ON ONE THING.

          DODGE.
          Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires

                         Â¢
          again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE, PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE'S BODY,

          PICKS HIM UP, AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE.
          Dodge's body twirls through the air -

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Will, Stewart and Huffs watch, dumbstruck, as DODGE'S BODY

          HITS THE WATER.
          Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the
          bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit...
          .disappearing into the dense park.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS PARK/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive.
          HELICOPTERS above.
          Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
          ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'
          Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.

                         OFFICER #1
          We can't gas the forest! The
          slightest wind would take it over
          to Tiburon.

                         OFFICER #2
          Well it'll take us months to find
          them in there.

                         OFFICER #3
          Not to mention rounding them all
          up.
          Will approaches the group.

                         WILL
          I know where they are.
          The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?
          Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.

                         HUFFS
          This man owns one of the chimps.

                         (BEAT)
          The so-called "leader". Says he
          can reason him out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. I think he'll
          listen to me. If he comes out, the
          other apes will follow.
          Sounds pretty far-fetched.

                         OFFICER #1
          You think you know where to find
          this monkey?
          Will starts to correct him - lets it go.

                         WILL
          I do. I used to bring him here.
          The Officers look at each other.

                         OFFICER #1
          We don't have a lot of options.
          Let's give it a try.

                         WILL
          But you have to promise me - if I
          can get them out, you'll take them
          peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage
          them. No killing.
          Beat.

                         HUFFS
          Whatever it takes.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

          Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
          the path Caesar and Will used to take.
          She's terrified, trying to mask it.

                         WILL
          You think this is a bad idea?

                         STEWART
          Definitely.
          He thought so.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          He's never going to agree to come
          out with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         WILL
          I know. Got to try, right? I owe
          him that much.
          Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses,
          turns to look at her.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING BACK)
          Think he'll forgive me?

                         STEWART
          (can't quite hear him)
          What?
          Will waves it off - never mind.
           Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into
          the woods.

          EXT. DEEP WOODS - DUSK

           Will walks. FLASH OF BLACK up ahead. His pulse quickens -
          he follows it.
          CRACKLING of BRANCHES.
          More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?
          Will follows.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Will enters the clearing.
          He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
          CANOPY that Caesar always loved.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an

          ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN.

                         HUFFS
          Follow me.
          Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S

          DIRECTION, GUNS READY.

                         STEWART
          Hang on a second...
          (to nearest Officer)
          Where are they going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles
          with all her might.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)

          WHERE ARE THEY GOING?!

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees.

                         WILL
          Caesar! ...
          He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN

          FRONT OF HIM.

          IT'S KOBA.
          Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his
          neck.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You.
          Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.
          He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
          this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.
          Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him
          away.

          ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST

          STARES HIM DOWN.

          KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.
          Which leaves just Will and Caesar.

                         CAESAR
          Humans coming.

                         WILL
          No. I'm alone.
          Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I owe you an apology.

                         CAESAR
          Will want Caesar dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         WILL
          I thought you had killed a man.
          But I should have known better.
          Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's
          thinking.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I want you to know that all of this
          is my fault. My responsibility.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you forgive me?
          BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path.
          Will realizes he's been betrayed.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          Wait - no -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave.

                         WILL
          I won't -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave now.

                         WILL
          No. I'm staying with you.
          Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.
          At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.
          Huffs takes aim at Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!

          HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST

          OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.

          AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES -- IT'S AN AMBUSH
          - a COUNTERATTACK.
          Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,
          but not fast enough.

          UNLIKE ALPHA'S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA, IT'S A SLAUGHTER IN THE

          APES' FAVOR.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          AS THE APES MAUL THE MEN, CAESAR CARRIES WILL THROUGH THE

          CARNAGE.

          EXT. WOODS - DUSK

          Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
          blood.
          Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
          Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
          Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
          Then the life passes out of him.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DUSK

          Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out
          at the forest in the gathering darkness.
          All is quiet.
          The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.

          HONK OF A HORN.

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small
          rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Hunsiker enters, settles into the seat.

                          TAXI DRIVER
           Where to, my man?
          It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT

          GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.

                         HUNSIKER
          SFO. International terminal.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          You got it.
          The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his
          forehead - he doesn't look too good.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
          wheels through the airport terminal.
          It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
          Hunsiker takes the escalator up.

          INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the
          front of the plane.

          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

          Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks
          a switch.

          EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

          The airplane takes off into the sky.

          NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)
          As the ape search continues, a
          virulent flu strain has exploded in
          and around San Francisco, sending
          shock waves and panic throughout
          the community.

          EXT. CLEARING - DAY

          We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
          of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #2
          Authorities suspect the origin of
          the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
          Laboratories - the same private
          company from which several
          laboratory chimpanzees escaped
          earlier this week -
          We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
          it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
          We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
          move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING

          APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.
          All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #3
          As the death toll rapidly rises,
          Hospitals are desperately trying to
          meet the growing demand...
          Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #4

                         (INCREASINGLY DESPERATE)
          Although isolated in the western
          region of the country, the numbers
          are catastrophic and quickly
          rising...
          Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #5
          Efforts to quarantine appear to
          have failed. The strain has been
          spotted as far away as Singapore
          and Australia...

          CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR'S FACE.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #6

                         (RAGGED)
          Casualties have reached apocalyptic
          levels. Authorities urge you to
          stay inside your homes...

                         (LONG BEAT)
          For those of you who can hear me, I
          say...

                         (VOICE BREAKING)
          God's speed and so long to you all.
          The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A

          SNOWY TELEVISION SET.

          CAESAR'S EYES FILL THE SCREEN.
THE ROCK

Revised 10/10/95

BEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE:

An impressionistic montage:

A SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit
polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We
never see him fully.

The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint.

On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos
of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER
into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL
COMBAT.



IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will
never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the
screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be...



IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin
as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND.

Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected
in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF
THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus



A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION
and we see --

A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here
sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the
communication ...



AII  CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S EYES and FADE IN:

EXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING

Two groundskeepers on "ride 'em" lawn mowers, BENNIE and MARLIN, smoke
Camels and watch the MARINE OFFICER from the opening montage.  He's
alone, across the cemetery.



						BENNIE 
		You'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow,
		holidays nothin, keeps him Away.



ACROSS THE CEMETERY

Brig.  Gen.  FRANCIS XAVIER HUMMEL stands before a headstone: BARBARA
MCLEAN HUMMEL 1946-1996.



						HUMMEL
		Hi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's
		depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to
		do.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have
		approved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything
		and I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it
		feels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking.



Hummel puts new flowers on the grave.  Walks off.

EXT.  ACCESS ROAD TO ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - NIGHT

Heavy rain.  A road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility.  A canvas
covered ARMY TRUCK blows a tire in the road.  The DRIVER gets out. 
Inspects the tire.



INT.  ARMY TRUCK - NIGHT

FOUR MARINES in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor
into a MANHOLE IN THE ROAD.



EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

Three ARMY M.P.s at the front GUARDHOUSE.  GENERAL HUMMEL pulls up in a
SUBURBAN.  The M.P.s immediately recognise him and stand more rigidly.



					ARMY M. P. 
		General Hummel, sir.  It's an honour. Is the Colonel
		expecting you, sir?



					HUMMEL
		Held better be.  This is a security inspection.



					ARMY M. P.
		Yes, sir!

The M.P. waves Hummel in, saluting crisply.

INT.  GRATED STORM DRAIN IN BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT

The four marines from the truck are waiting, readying arms.  The leader
is looking at his watch.  Gives a hand signal to the others, and up they
go --



EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT

The four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered
positions in the compound.



200 YARDS AWAY - TWO ARMY "MAGAZINE CHECKERS" emerge from a building
with clipboards, on routine check.


INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT

The Army M.P.s escort General Hummel inside.  THREE ARMY GUARDS spring
up from their SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.  Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid
at attention.  COLONEL CALLAHAN emerges from an adjacent room,
sleepy-eyed.



					COLONEL CALLAHAN 
		General Hummel!  This is a surprise!



				HUMMEL 
		That's the idea, Colonel.



EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT

Two marines position themselves outside the door to the bunker
compound's elevated watch tower.



EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT

Below the watch tower, the ARMY MAGAZINE CHECKERS approach.  Marines 1
and 2 spring out, armed with M-16s with over/under grenade launchers
They shoot BEAN BAG projectiles at the Army Guards, who collapse, dazed.



INT.  BUNKER COMPOUND WATCH TOWER - NIGHT

Marines 3 and 4 burst inside the watch tower.  The guards inside spring
up.  BOOM BOOM, they're hit by bean bag projectiles, propelling them out
the windows of the watch tower.  They fall 10 feet and lie unconscious.



EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT

Marines 1 and 2, now in MAGAZINE CHECYERIS UNIFORMS, move to the BUNKER
DOOR.  They open the door with the Magazine checker's CODED CARDS.



INT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT

Two ARMY GUARDS, playing poker, look up at the entering marines. 
Marines 1 and 2 walk straight up to the Army Guards, holding them at bay
with M-16s.  Before any words are spoken, one of the marines injects
each of the guards with a VACCINE PISTOL.



INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT

Four more marines led by SGT.  CRISP enter, holding Col. Callahan,
General Hummel and the Army Guards at bay.



					SGT.  CRISP
		This is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and
		infiltrated your compound.  I'm afraid you and your men are my
		prisoners, sir.

The marines begin cuffing the Army Guards to the radiator and taping
their mouths.



					SGT.  CRISP 
		Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.



						HUMMEL 
					(to Callahan) 
		Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there
		doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel.  Here
		you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator.  This is not a
		tight ship.  I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.



Sgt.  Crisp hits the FRONT GATE'S OPEN BUZZER and follows Hummel out of
the room.



EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

The gate swings open.  TWO HUMVEES enter the compound.

EXT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT

The marines use a 'rabbit tool, (hydraulic, compact and powerful) to pry
open the bunker's steel doors.  They rush down a hallway.



CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - INTERIOR HALLWAY - The marines rush up to
another steel door and quickly pry it open.



INT.  C.B.W. BUNKER - NIGHT

A refrigerated storage room for chemical weapons.  Storage tubes are
labelled: V.X. POISON GAS.  Across the room are rockets labelled: 55 115
MM BOLT ROCKETS.



Using the TRACK HOOK SYSTEM in the bunker's ceiling, the marines move
the V.X. CHEM ROUNDS and BOLT ROCKETS to the waiting humvees.  It's very
fast, like clockwork.



EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOLIND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

The Humvees, followed by Hummel in his Suburban, roar out of the
compound.  CUT TQ:



INT.  H " EL'S SUBURBAN - NIGHT

Hummel on a c.b. radio: A textbook exercise, gentlemen. Rendezvous in
eleven hours.


EXT.  F.B.I. FIELD OFFICE, FT.  DIETRICK, MD. - DAY

Establish headquarters for chemical/biological weapons.

INT.  F.B.I. OFFICE - CHEMICAL/BIOLOGIAL DIVISION - DAY

A WINDOWED DOOR stencilled "Chemical/Biological Weapons Division." A
RUBBER DART hits the glass and drops into A TRASH CAN next to the door.


					ISHERWOOD
					 (V.O.)
		Son of a bitch...

					GOODSPEED
					 (V.O.) 
		You owe me five dollars, Marvin.



ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL GOODSPEED, 30, and partner/trainee MARVIN
ISHERWOOD, 25, feet up on desks, with toy guns.  This is Man's Boredom. 
A ceiling fan circles.  Isherwood yawns; scratches neck with his gun
barrel.



GOODSPEED reloads.  Aims.  Fires.

THE DART hits A CARDBOARD TARGET across the room which activates a Rube
Goldberg series of events ending in a PLASTIC GIRL being ignited in a
PAN OF CHEMICALS.



GOODSPEED, without even getting up, casually sprays the pan with flame
retardant foam.



					ISHERWOOD
					 (yawns) 
		I was told this was exciting work.



					GOODSPEED 
		Patience, Marvin.  It has its moments.



A KLAXON sounds.  Isherwood smiles excitedly.

INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Isherwood follows Goodspeed down a grimy, off-white corridor illuminated
by antiseptic light.  This is an older building.  Hasn't been
refurbished and shows it.



INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - LABORATORY - DAY

A medium-sized laboratory, where 5 F.B.I. TECHNICIANS are bent over
tables of beakers, test-tubes, Bunsen burners, etc.  The room and
equipment are old and used; could be 1976 rather than 1996.



Along one side of the lab is a plexi-glass wall. Inside the plexi-glass
is an airlocked GAS CHAMBER. F.B.I chemists LONNER and LING motion to
Goodspeed.

					DR. LONNER

		C'mere, Billy. 
			(points inside gas chamber) 
		A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian 
		refugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas.



INSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF
POISON DETECTION INSTRUMENTS.



					ISHERWOOD 
		Bosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it.



					GOODSPEED 
		Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians
		don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out
		your hand.



Isherwood does so.  It's shaky.

					ISHERWOOD 
		I'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it-



Hold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO:

INT.  GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open.  Goodspeed
and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter. 
They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate.



A GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes (like a salt shaker) descends from
the ceiling.  Inside are COCKROACHES. .



						GOODSPEED 
		Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.



						DR. LING
 					  (into mike) 
		We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed.



						GOODSPEED
					(into helmet mike) 
		July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william
		Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a
		wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside.



Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries
open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they
gingerly lift the lid.

INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with "UNICEF" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts
out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a
POISON SENSOR past each.



						GOODSPEED 
		Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts
		out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes.


						ISHERWOOD 
		This is thrilling.


Isherwood lifts out a DOLL.  Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes
crazy... !


						GOODSPEED 
		Careful, goddamn it Marvin!



The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting
Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm.



OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked "exhaust" and
another marked "emergency."



A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit.


IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST
FANS begin to suck it up.



IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and
explode, guts splattering the vessel walls.



						ISHERWOOD 
		What's hap...  what's happening....?



DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel.

						DR. LING 
	Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're
	okay.



Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and
grabs A SCALPEL.  Cuts open the doll's chest.



						GOODSPEED 
		I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news
		is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits.



ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble
and corrode.



						DR. LING 
		What's the really bad news.



GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES.

						GOODSPEED 
		Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas
		to kill everybody in the building.



Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting.

						ISHERWOOD 
		The acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit...



						GOODSPEED 
		Chill, Marvin. 
					(yells outside) 
		WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS?



Dr. Lonner flips on the sprinklers.  The pipes KNOCK.  A FEW PATHETIC
DROPS trickle from the SPRINKLER HEADS.



						DR. LONNER 
		Something's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name
		are they gonna give us a new building ...



						DR. LING 
		Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin.



Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several
6 inch needled SYRINGES.



						DR. LING 
		You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it.
			(Goodspeed continues to inspect-the device)
		Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.



Isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe.

						GOODSPEED 
		Get that away from me. 
				      (to himself)
		I hate needles.



						DR. LING 
		INJECT YOURSELF!


						GOODSPEED 
		LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER?


The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING.

						DR. LONNER 
		It's coming, it's coming ...


ISHERWOOD sinks to his knees, holding the huge syringe in front of his
heart, hari-kari style, hands trembling ...

GOODSPEED concentrates on the device; his calm is unsettling.  His hands
flash, grabbing instruments and performing precise, deft, functions.  He
snips a wire and splices it.  Another.  Another.



						DR.  LING 
						(sweating it out)
	Ten seconds, Bill.



Isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest.

						ISHERWOOD 
		Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY
		IT'S REAL.



ISHERWOOD drops the syringe.  Fumbles for another... GOODSPEED,
ice-cold, continues on the device ...



						DR. LING 
		Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ...



GOODSPEEDIS RUBBER GLOVE is stretched to transparency. we see
GOODSPEED'S FLESH through the acid-eaten rubber.  He makes one final
cut-and-clamp.  THE DETONATOR on the poison gas turns off.



						DR. LING 
		Three, two...  the gas is clear!



OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - GREEN LIGRTS FLASR on the control panel and A
TORRENTIAL SPRAY soaks GOODSPEED AND ISRERWOOD.  Isherwood is wide-eyed
and trembling.  Goodspeed glares at him.



						DR. LING 				
		Next time use the atropine!



						GOODSPEED
		I don't like needles.


EXT.  GEORGETOWN - STREETS/ALLEYWAY - DAY

The bohemian part around Georgetown U. Goodspeed heads down an alley
between two townhouses.  LOUD COUNTRY MUSIC emanates from an apt. above.
Goodspeed ascends.



INT.  GEORGETOWN - GOODSPEED'S APARTMENT - DAY

A young woman stands in the middle of the living room, belting out a
Carlene Carter tune in cowboy boots, rhinestone blouse and skirt.  CARLA
PESTALOZZI, 20's, is playing guitar, accompanied by a boom box.


						CARLA 
		Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing
		about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, (notices Goodspeed)
		Wanna keep you locked up at home ...


Goodspeed walks past her into the kitchen.  Carla turns down the music. 
Goodspeed re-enters with a Budweiser.


						CARLA 
				(New Jersey accent) 
		Hey there.



						GOODSPEED 
		Hey honey.


						CARLA 
		Wrote a new song.  Wanna hear it?



Goodspeed sits heavily on the couch.  Rubs his temples. 

						GOODSPEED
		Not now.

						CARLA 
		Boy, somebody's in a bad mood.



						GOODSPEED 
		Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood.



Carla changes the c.d.: A PUCCINI OPERA plays.

						CARLA 
		Better?

						GOODSPEED 
		Much better. She sits with him.  Puts her arm around him.

						CARLA 
		What happened baby.  Tell me.


						GOODSPEED 
		Had a close one.

						CARLA 
		You want to talk about it?


						GOODSPEED 
		Not really.

						CARLA 
		You know how I feel about what you do.

						GOODSPEED 
		Could we change the subject?

						CARLA 
		That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.

						GOODSPEED 
		Hey!  Now there's some good news.

						CARLA 
		You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?

						GOODSPEED 
		Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed
		for the Mona Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
						 (smiles) 
		I hope that's a compliment.  I could change my name.  How 'bout
		Bobby Sue Pestalozzi?  Billy io Pestalozzi?



						GOODSPEED 
		Stick with Carla.

						CARLA 
		Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? 
				(GOODSPEED frowns) 
		Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.



						GOODSPEED 
		We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down,
		inside and out ...



						CARLA
		Billy, this probably isn't the best time ...
		Bill, I'm uhhh.


						CARLA 
		I'm pregnant.



						GOODSPEED

		You're what ... ?

She holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO:

EXT.  DESERT AREA (SOUTHWESTERN U.S.) - DAY

TWO = Y GUNSHIPS roar over camera and land next to the two Humvees.  The
Huey's doors open.  Marine Captains FRYE and DARROW, both late 20's,
drag out two MARINE LANCE CORPORALS, bound and gagged, and sit them
down.  Other marines roll gurneys laden with chem rounds, rockets and
other equipment onto the Hueys.

They Hueys ascend and SCREAM off across the desert and CUT TO:

EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - AFTERNOON


Establishing shots of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island in the middle of
San Francisco Bay.


EXT.  ALCATRAZ ISLAND - AFTERNOON

A PARK RANGER (JOE) leads a group of 80 TOURISTS across the prison
exercise yard.  In the background looms the city of San Francisco and
Golden Gate Bridge.



						PARK RANGER JOE 
		Alcatraz - "the Rock" - is the most famous, and was the
		most feared, prison ever built.  Here the inmates were allowed one hour
		of daily exercise.



						FEMALE TOURIST 
		Is it really true no one escaped?



						PARK RANGER JOE 
		True, madam.  From 1936 until the prison's closing in
		1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one's believed to have made
		it to shore - alive at least.



The tourists file off toward the MAIN CELL HOUSE.  Bringing up the rear
are Gen.  Hummel, Maj.  Baxter, Sgt.  Crisp, Capt.  Hendrix, and Pvts. 
Scarpetti,.  Royce, Gamble and Starling, all in civilian clothes.



Hummel motions to Crisp, who bleeds off with Scarpetti and Royce. 
Hummel and the others continue with the group.



INT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Cell Blocks B and C, which inmates called "Broadway." A long corridor
with three tiers of cells on each side.



The Ranger leads the tourist group inside.

					PARK RANGER JOE 
		Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly; Robert Stroud, the Birdman
		of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells.



The Ranger pulls the CELL DOOR OPEN/SHUT LEVER (recessed in the wall at
the end of cell block).  All the cell doors on the first floor slide
open.


					PARK RANGER JOE 
	Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S. Park Service
	cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz - temporarily of
	course.



The tourists laugh and move inside the cells.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - WHARF - AFTERNOON The side across from San Francisco. 
The TOURIST BOAT is docked in front of the U.S. PARK RANGERS' OFFICE.



Sgt.  Crisp and Pvts.  Scarpetti and Royce walk up to the Ranger's
office.  They look left and right, then enter.



INT.  ALCATRAZ - U.S. PARK RANGERS OFFICE - AFTERNOON TWO PARK RANGERS
and a SECRETARY look up.

					ALCATRAZ PARK RANGER 
		You're not supposed to leave the tour, guys.  Is
		there a problem?



					SGT.  CRISP 
		Big problem.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL BLOCK - AFTERNOON

The tourists are in the cells, looking around.  Park Ranger Joe notices
Hummel, Baxter, and the other marines standing behind him.  Smiles:

					PARK RANGER JOE
		Don't want to be locked up, fellahs?

					HUMMEL 
		Not today.  You go ahead.

					PARK RANGER JOE 
		I don't think so hah hah.

Baxter draws a .45 and places it to Ranger ioe's head.

					HUMMEL 
		I think so.

Startled, Park Ranger Joe backs into a cell.  Baxter grabs the cell door
open/shut lever and yanks it.  The cell doors CLANG shut.  Hummel,
Baxter and the others walk off.



					TOURISTS 
		Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going
		on... ?

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PARADE GROUND - AFTERNOON

Hummel and Baxter walk up to the PARADE GROUND as THE TWO HUEY GUNSHIPS
approach.  They hover above the parade ground.  Cpts.  Frye and Darrow
rope-deploy from the Hueys.  They stand at attention, saluting Hummel
and Baxter.

					CAPTAIN FRYE 
		General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow.

					HUMMEL 
		Deploy as planned, Captain.

				(unison) 
		Aye, aye, sir.

FRY AND DARROW

They hand signal to the Huey pilots.  The Hueys take off around the back
of the island.  
						CUT TO:

A MONTAGE of short INTERCUT scenes, all AFTERNOON:

THE INFIRMARY, UPSTAIRS ROOM A former hospital room will be the command
and communications center.  PVTS.  GAMBLE and STARLING set up a portable
desk, chair, and an array of communications equipment (including
portable satellite dish and look out).



EXT.  THE ISLAND'S SHORELINE

CPT.  HENDRIX AND PVTS.  ROYCE and SCARPETTI lay motion sensors on the
perimeter.

INT.  THE PRISON MORGUE

PVTS.  COX and MCCOY load the V.X. CHEM ROUNDS from INSULATED COOLING
BAGS (size of a big gym bag) into the morguels CORPSE DRAWERS.

MAJOR BAXTER sets up a PORTABLE Rocket LAUNCHER.

EXT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE ROOFTOP CAPTS.  FRYE and DARROW set up a second
portable rocket launcher.



INT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELLHOUSE - DAY

The tourists are now panicked, confused, and making a commotion. 
Shouting and yelling.  A woman is crying.

Suddenly a .45 is fired.  Total silence.  Hummel and Baxter, followed by
Pvts.  Gamble and Starling (pulling a gurney stacked with MARINE FIELD
RATIONS), walk to the middle of the cell block.

						HUMMEL
		Hello Ladies and Gentlemen.  You are my prisoners.  I have no intention
		of harming you.  You will be fed regularly.  That is all you need to
		know for now.

Gamble and Starling begin passing out the field rations. 53 INT. 
WASHINGTON D.C. - J. EDGAR HOOVER BUILDING - NIGHT F.B.I. Director JAMES
WOMACK exits his office in a tuxedo, trailed by MARGIE WOOD, a young
F.B.I. Agent.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Can it wait till morning, Agent Wood, I'm going
		to hear Bruce Springsteen ...


						AGENT WOOD 
				(re: Womack's tux) 
		In that?

						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Christ, the concert's for the Prince of Wales or
		somebody ...

						AGENT WOOD 
		I really think you should take this call personally.

They stare at each other and CUT TO: 54 INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - DIRECTOR
WOMACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT -- Womack, grabbing his phone. F.B.I. DIRECTOR
WOMACK F.B.I. Director Womack.

						HUMMEL 
							(V.O.) 
		First:	I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on
		Alcatraz Island.  Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the
		media or there will not be eighty.  Second: fifteen guided rockets armed
		with V.X. poison, are currently aimed at the population of San
		Francisco.  I will call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Wait.  Who is this?

						HUMMEL 
		Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.

CLICK.  Womack stares at the phone: calls to outer office:


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Mary Jane, get the Pentagon! (to Agent Wood) Call
		the San Francisco office.  It seems Alcatraz was just re-opened.

Agent wood gives him a curious look and CUT TO:

INT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY/COMMAND CENTER - AFTERNOON

Cpts.  Hendrix, before Hummel.

Frye, and Darrow, and Sgt.  Crisp at attention Maj.  Baxter at Hummells
side.



						HUMMEL 
		At ease, Gentlemen.  It is traditional for me to meet with my
		officers before an operation.  The heart performs one thing, the legs
		another, the brain another - all better function together or the body
		becomes ill, is prone to disease. (beat) Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I
		have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my
		adjutant in the Gulf.  Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a
		beatnik. 
			(the crew-cutted HENDRIX smiles Captain Frye, Captain Darrow.) 
		You and your men are new to me.


						CAPTAIN FRYE 
		Would the General like a recitation of our service records?


						HUMMEL 
		I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are
		excellent.  I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here.  You
		both stand to profit from this.


					CAPTAIN FRYE 
		Profit is not my motive, sir.  I am here to redress a
		wrong.


					CAPTAIN DARROW 
		Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.


					HUMMEL 
		This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain
		Darrow: They are called courts of law.  In the military, they are called
		Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned.  They
		are called schools.  Am I confusing you?


					CAPTAIN DARROW 
		Well, sir, frankly ...
		EL I see that I am ' 
						(beat)

					HUMMEL 
		The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. 
		Plain and simple.  An insurrection against a government to which we have
		sworn allegiance.  Everyone in this room must understand that.

Hummel looks from face to face, studying each.

					HUMMEL 
		The question is what kind of traitor are we.  Coward or lion? 
		Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson?  I have posed that question to
		myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear.  Have all of you?



					HUMMELS' OFFICERS 
		Yes, sir.

					HUMMEL 
		Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not
		return.  All of you can live with that?

					OTHER OFFICERS 
						(unison) 
		Yes, sir.

					HUMMEL 
		Well, I cannot.  So, regardless of what happens on this island in
		the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.

					CAPTAIN HENDRIX 
		But General, you'll be prosecuted.

					HUMMEL 
		Yes, Captain.  And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will
		make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take
		your posts, gentlemen.  Semper fi.
	
Hummel's men fall out and exit.  Baxter, the last to exit, salutes
Hummel.

INT.  PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

Many people around a table, each with a DOSSIER on Hummel:

F.B.I. Director Womack (still in tuxedo), F.B.I. agent Margie Wood,
White House Chief of Staff HAYDEN SINCLAIR, National Security Advisor
LOUIS LINDSTROM, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs GENERAL ALBERT KRAMER, Air
Force General PETERSON, and C.I.A. Director MILTON AMWAY.



					GENERAL KRAMER 
		Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of
		a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets.  It wasn't
		discovered until the shift change this morning.


ON THE SCREEN - A YOUNGER HUMMEL in Vietnam.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time.



MORE SLIDES OF HUMMEL in various international theaters.

					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. 
		Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal
		of...  Jesus. 
					   	(looks up) 
		The man is a hero.



					GENERAL KRAMER 
		A legend.  During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C.
		single-handedly.  Saved his whole company.  Hence the nickname
		"gunfighter."



					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? 
		Anybody read it?


					RAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		No.  Give me the skinny.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have
		either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting
		American lives.  I happen to share General Hummells view.



The door opens.  A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in.

					NAVAL ATTACHE 
		General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the
		table.

					GENERAL KRAMER 
		Frank, this is Albert Kramer.


					HUMMEL 
		Hello Al.  Howlre Judy and the kids?


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		They're fine.  I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I.
		Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom,
		and C.I.A. Director Amway.  You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. 
		Can you help us out?


INTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary.

					HUMMEL 
		I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three
		Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. 
		Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...


					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		Southern China?  We never admitted we sent troops into
		China.

There is a pause.

					HUMMEL 
		Who is that.  Identify yourself.

Everyone stares at sinclair.

					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.



					HUMMEL 
		How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.



					RAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		I'm thirty-three.

					HUMMEL 
		Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday
		I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed
		that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat,
		ignorant mouth.  He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.



Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again,
who hands him a phone and whispers:



					NAVAL ATTACHE 
		The President calling from Moscow.

Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking
sotto voice.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		Continue Frank.

					HUMMEL 
		Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and
		El Salvador.  Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures
		on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside
		Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu,
		gentlemen.  No benefits were paid to their families; no medals
		conferred.  These men died for their country and they weren't even given
		a coddamn military burial. 
					(beat) 
		This situation will not stand: you
		will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading
		Company" account to an account I designate.  From these funds,
		reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83
		marines, families.  The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's
		expenses.  Am I clear?


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is
		that?



					HUMMEL 
		Identify yourself.


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		F.B.I. Director Womack, General.



					HUMMEL 
		You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the
		Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

					GENERAL KRAMER 
		Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.


					WOMACK 
					(stunned) 
		Is this true?

General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.

					HUMMEL 
		If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney
		General and the boys down at Justice where it came from.  Good luck.


Hayden Sinclair returns to the table.


					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		General, I've just spoken to the President and he is
		clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care
		if ...


					HUMMEL 
		Someone please gag that man. 
					(beat) 
		Alert the media, I launch the gas.  Refuse payment, I launch the gas.
		It is just after midnight.  You have 36 hours - all of today and half
		of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money.  Don't even consider
		the standard counter measure, General.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket
		armed with V.X., General Peterson?


					GENERAL PETERSON 
			In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...


					RAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		Well that's not so bad ...



					I GENERAL PETERSON 
		Thousand.  Seventy thousand.  Dead. one teaspoon will
		kill all living organisms in a three story office building.  Get the
		point?



					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?

					GENERAL PETERSON 
		Napalm.  Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm.  
		It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation.  The problem is
		that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. 
		Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		'Course he does. 
					(explaining to others) 
		"Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still 
		in its test phase.  It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X. 
					(dawning on him) 
		That explains Hummells time frame.  He knows we're not
		operational.  What would it take, General?


					GENERAL PETERSON 
		To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36
		hours?  An act of God. 
					(off Kramer's look) 
		All right, we can try.  But
		view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		Then on to our primary initiative. (hits intercom button)
		Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. (to F.B.I. Womack) Who's your
		best chemical biological man?



					AGENT WOOD 
					(rises) 
		I'll find out.



					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
		Tell him to pack a bag for San Francisco.



EXT.  GOODSPEED'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT Tarpaper and gravel roof. 
Candles burning.  Loretta Lynnls "Stand by Your Man" on the boom box. 
AMONGST THE RUSTY SUPPORT SCAFFOLDS of an old sign from the 120's --



CARLA and GOODSPEED are, to put it delicately, madly passionately
athletically fucking.  Standing up.  They both have robes on.  A
CORDLESS PHONE RINGS.  Again.

					CARLA 
		Don't stop...  do no stop.

						GOODSPEED 
		Shit, shit, shit what time is it. 
					(fumbles for phone) 
		Hello.
					(pause) 
		I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.



GOODSPEED hangs up.  The couple stares at each other. Carla's seen this
look before ...


						GOODSPEED 
		I've got to go to San Francisco.


					CARLA 
		No. I'm sorry, but NO.  I need you here with me.  We need to talk
		about this...


						GOODSPEED 
		I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't...  I
		cannot deal with this right now ... (softly) Bill, I am very Catholic. 
		And very pregnant.  And very unmarried.  Help me with this.


She turns away from him.  He pulls her back...


					GOODSPEED 
		I love you.  I will marry you.  I just didn't plan on this,
		that's all.  Tell you what: come to San Francisco.


					CARLA 
		Really? 
					(smiles) 
		Really?


					GOODSPEED 
		It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel,
		order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...


					CARLA
		... We'll finish what we started.  Baby, are you sexy in those
		boots ...


GOODSPEED walks off in COWBOY BOOTS, robe and boxers,..

INT.  PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT U.S.N. commander CHARLES
ANDERSON, 35, just the hardest looking man you've ever seen, stands
before the group.  Anderson is a Navy S.E.A.L., an Incursion Team
Leader.  Before Anderson are AERIAL RECON PHOTOS of Alcatraz.


					COMMANDER ANDERSON
		 A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. 
		Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might
		launch.  My second in command is working on an attack from within the
		prison. 
					(beat) 
		The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison,
		undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind -
		take their rocket positions without a shot fired.  But I need better
		intelligence.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		You've studied the architectural plans.


					COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		They're useless.  Alcatraz was originally a Civil War
		fort.  It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years.  Under there is a maze
		of shit, excuse my language. 
					(beat) 
		What I need is personal, firsthand
		intelligence on the island's tunnels.


CAMERA FOCUSES ON F.B.I. Director Womack, who gives a very significant
look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.


					GENERAL KRAMER 
		The former warden?


					AGENT WOOD 
		Died in 1979.  The guards we contacted are useless.  There
		was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he
		died in 1983.


					GENERAL PETERSON 
		Didn't three guys escape?  I thought I saw a movie about it.


					AGENT WOOD 
		It's a Hollywood myth.  No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.


F.B.I. Director trades a very significant look with C.I.A. Director
AMWAY.  Amway clears his throat.  He is older, very old school. 
Everyone turns to him.


					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
		There is someone who can help us.


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		The C.I.A. Director and I have something to
		discuss in private.

Womack and Amway rise and exit together.  Everyone else sits there,
confused.

INT.  PENTAGON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT Womack and Amway exit into the
corridor.  They huddle tightly against the wall.  Sotto voice:      -


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		You're not actually suggesting ...

					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
		The man spent every night for six months making a
		dry-run of his escape.  He knows every inch of that island.  We have to,
		Jim.


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		I am very uncomfortable about this.


INT.  WOLFBURG PENITENTIARY - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT A long row of cells. 
CAMERA slowly DOLLIES past cell after cell.  Sullen INMATES stare
blankly at us ...



					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
					(O.S.) 
		I knew, I knew someday, this would come
		back to bite us.



CAMERA moves through a door marked "ISOLATION." At the end of a gloomy
corridor is a CAST-IRON DOOR.



BACK TO THE PENTAGON CORRIDOR

					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
		it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly. 
		When was the last time you saw him?



					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		when he escaped from San Quentin.



					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
		The man was an S.A.S. trained killer.



BACK TO WOLFBURG - IN THE ISOLATION CELL

TWO FEDERAL MARSHALS open the cell.'s steel locking bar.  They push open
the door.  Dark inside.  A MAN sits on the bed.

					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
		Can we risk letting.him out?

A SHAFT OF LIGHT cuts across the cell floor.

					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
		The question is: can we not?

THE SHAFT OF LIGHT slices the face of JOHN PAUL MASON.  He is British,
at least once was, imprisoned without trial for 33 years on U.S. soil. 
For now, we have no idea why.



EXT.  WASHINGTON D.C. - DULLES AIRPORT HANGAR - MIGHT

Raining.  An F.B.I GULFSTREAM 4 JET sits on the tarmac.

EXT.  F.B.I. GULFSTREAM - NIGHT

F.B.I. Director Womack sits with FRANCIS REYNOLDS, 30, an Assistant U.S.
Attorney from the Justice Dept. GOODSPEED sits across the aisle.


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		I'm told you're our best chemical weapons man, Goodspeed.  
		What's your education?


						GOODSPEED 
		B.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry
		and toxicology.


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Excellent.  What do you know about V.X. gas?

Pause. GOODSPEED stares at Womack.

						GOODSPEED 
		This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		No Goodspeed.  It's not a training exercise.


HOLD ON GOODSPEED'S reaction, and CUT TO:

EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - FEDERAL BUILDING - DAWN

Dawn breaks over San Francisoo.  A BLACK SEDAN and BLACK SUBURBANS pull
up to the F.B.I.'s West Coast office.  Goodspeed, Womack and Reynolds
get out, go inside.



INT.  F.B.I. - OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

We watch MASON being led into an INTERROGATION ROOM, his legs in irons,
his hands cuffed behind him.


'We are watching through a TWO-WAY MIRROR, and WIDEN TO: Womack,
Goodspeed, Reynolds and ERNEST SANCHEZ, S.F. Bureau Agent in Charge, are
watching Mason.  Sanchez is a gruff guy with the subtlety of a heart
attack.


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		The following is a state secret.  Disclose it to
		any party and you will be subject to prosecution.  His name is John
		Mason.  A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962,
		escaped in 1963.


					AGENT SANCHEZ 
		Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ...


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez.  Do not
		argue and do not question.  He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin,
		from which he escaped in February, 1976.  He's been held at Wolfburg
		since.  He has no identity.  He does not exist.  Understood? 
					(turns to Sanchez) 
		I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the
		route he took through the island's tunnels.


					AGENT SANCHEZ 
		You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?


					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Don't even entertain it.  This man laughs at
		strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either.


						GOODSPEED 
		Why's he going to help us now?


						U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS 
						(hands Womack PARDON) 
		Mason's papers are in order, sir.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon.



						AGENT SANCHEZ 
		Steep price for some information. (waves pardon away) I
		don't need that to get what you want.



						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Sanchez - try subtlety.

						AGENT SANCHEZ 
		It's my middle name. 
						(to Goodspeed)
		Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something.



Sanchez exits.



						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
						(grumbles)
		I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ...



IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON looks around.  He focuses on the
mirror.  He stares right through at GoodsDeed. GOODSPEED is fascinated, 
unnerved.



			GOODSPEED 
						(to himself) 
		Jesus look at this guy.



INT.  F.B.I. - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING Sanchez walks in, sipping
coffee.  Mason sits there, eyes forward.


						SANCHEZ 
		I'm F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Sanchez.


Sanches sits.  Mason stares at the table.

						MASON 
		In charge of what?  Fucking me over for another three decades?



						SANCHEZ 
						(congenial) 
		Hey.  Easy.  I just want to talk.



						MASON 
		You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez?  Fucking Bloody Idiots. 
		I don't want to talk to you.



A pause.  Sanchez glares at Mason.

						SANCHEZ 
		Just some questions about Alcatraz.  It's a tourist attraction
		now.  You remember Alcatraz, Mason.

The word "Alcatraz" registers with Mason.


						MASON 
		Do I remember Alcatraz.

						SANCHEZ  
		Not the island itself.  The tunnels underneath it.


IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM

						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Real subtle, SANCHEZ...


IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM


						SANCHEZ  
		There's no harm in cooperating with us.


						MASON  
		Who's "us?" F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do that?


						SANCHEZ  
		Maybe there's a gift in it for you.



						MASON  
						(to the mirror) 
		Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.


THE OBSERVATION ROOM

GOODSPEED smiles slightly:

			GOODSPEED 
		"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."



THE INTERROGATION ROOM

						MASON  
		Are you capable of reading, Sanchez?


SANCHEZ is getting flustered.


						SANCHEZ  
		I don't have time for this shit... 
						(pause; stares at mason) 
		Yes. I can read.


						MASON  
		The story of Alchimadus.  Know it?


						SANCHEZ  
		No.

THE OBSERVATION ROOM

			GOODSPEED 
						(to himself) 
		Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his
		king.

THE INTERROGATION ROOM

						MASON  
		Thomas a Beckett.  Heard of him?


						SANCHEZ  
		Maybe.  Not really.

THE OBSERVATION ROOM

			GOODSPEED 
						(to himself) 
		Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and
		executed by Henry the Second ...



THE INTERROGATION ROOM

						MASON  
		Solzhenitsyn.  I've a sneaking suspicion you've heard of him.



THE OBSERVATION ROOM



			GOODSPEED 
						(to himself)
		 Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.



THE INTERROGATION ROOM

SANCHEZ draws a blank on Solzhenitsyn.

						SANCHEZ  
		Look, I'm asking the fucking questions here. 
						(beat) 
		You can trust the F.B.I.


						MASON  
		That's a good one, Sanchez.  What do you call and F.B.I. Agent who
		can't tell a lie?  A mute.


MASON  turns away.  As if SANCHEZ  
no longer exists. Suddenly, over a
wall-mounted INTERCOM:



						U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS  
						(V.O.) 
		Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word
		with you?


						SANCHEZ  
		Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail.


SANCHEZ tosses a quarter on the desk and exits.


IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Impressive, Sanchez.

			GOODSPEED 
		You mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot?



						SANCHEZ  
		He'll eat him alive.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		He's already had you for the first course. 
					(hands GOODSPEED the pardon)
		Go.


GOODSPEED takes the pardon, goes for the door.

THE INTERROGATION ROOM

GOODSPEED enters.  He's completely out of his element, has no idea what
he's doing, and is-suddenly face-to-face with this.... MASON creature.


The two men regard each other.



			GOODSPEED 
		Take his cuffs off.

The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists.  MASON rubs his wrists, staring now
at Goodspeed.


						MASON  
		Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa?



So much for Goodspeed's confidence.

			GOODSPEED 
		No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. 
						(rallys) 
		Mr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release 
		contract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man,
		provided you cooperate.


He slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason.  MASON looks at the pen, then
Goodspeed.



						MASON  
		What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.

			GOODSPEED 
						(lying) 
		I'm a field agent.

						MASON  
		Tell me what you really do.


IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Don't answer that, GOODSPEED ....



IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

			GOODSPEED 
		I'm a chemical biological weapons expert.



MASON registers this information.... 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I.
DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid ....



IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM MASON  
stares at the pardon contract, thinking.

						MASON  
		You said I'd be a free man.  Define free


			GOODSPEED 
		Uhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered.


						MASON  
		I know what the fucking word means, idiot.  In this context.



			GOODSPEED 
		I don't understand....

						MASON  
		During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?

			GOODSPEED 
		Well yes I suppose ...

						MASON  
		You suppose?

			GOODSPEED 
		Yes.  You'll be outside.

IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM

						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed.



IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

						MASON  
		What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?


			GOODSPEED 
		A hostage situation.  A matter of life and death.


MASON thinks.  He picks up the pen.


						MASON  
						(looks at mirror) 
		Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in
		the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists.  I want a shower and a new
		suit of clothes.



			GOODSPEED 
		I think we can arrange that.


With that MASON picks up the pen and signs the pardon contract.  He
hands it to Goodspeed, who exits.


MASON turns toward the mirror, staring right through.

INT.  F.B.I. ~ OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY SANCHEZ  
and GOODSPEED enter. 

GOODSPEED hands U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS the signed pardon contract.

						
						SANCHEZ  
		Why didn't you throw in a trip to Fiji?


						U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS  
		I'll have this forwarded to the President,
		Director.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		No. You'll give it to me. 
						(pause) 
		Give it to me, Reynolds.


Reynolds reluctantly hands the pardon to Womack.

						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
							(to Sanchez) 
		Show Attorney Reynolds outside there's a car waiting for him.  And SANCHEZ - 
		I'll handle the next stage.


SANCHEZ leads the perturbed Reynolds out. GOODSPEED 
and Womack are alone now.  And WOMACK tears up the pardon

			GOODSPEED 
		Sir, that's a legal document.

						
						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		I'll decide what's legal, Goodspeed.

Over WOMACK'S SHOULDER, GOODSPEED 
WATCHES AS --

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON

places THE QUARTER on the floor.  He raises his metal chair; SLAMS it
down on the quarter.

			GOODSPEED 
Sir, those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn:
all had something in common.

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON  
picks up the coin.  It has a DEEP BURR
in it.  He moves to the mirror; begins carving into the glass.


			GOODSPEED 
		They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong.  What's going
		on, sir?


GOODSPEED watches MASON over Womack's shoulder.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		You're out of your depth, Goodspeed.  You are on
		a need to know basis and you do not need to know.


MASON has etched a circle in the mirror.  He slams his elbow against it.
The glass caves in, CRASHES to the floor.


GOODSPEED and Womack whirl around, startled.  MASON  
leans into the observation room.


						MASON  
		one more thing: a shave and a haircut. 
						(sees Womack) 
		Hello Womack.


MASON and Womack stare at each other and CUT TO:

EXT.  MOJAVE - DESERT FLATS - MORNING A hot desert-vista.  Miles of
nowhere.  A DODGE sits under a tripod.  Suspended from the tripod, a
BLINKING DEVICE.


The device DETONATES, showering the car with WHITE HOT BURNING LIQUID
and amazingly, the car melts into a pool of molten steel, disintegrating
to ash, which blows across the desert.


50 YARDS AWAY - U.S.A.F. LT.  JIMMY FISK and CPT.  LARRY GILER (both
late 20's) emerge from the heat waves in heat-refletive suits, walking
toward A HEAT PROTECTIVE BUNKER (a wall coated with heat reflective
metal.)


BEHIND THE BUNKER U.S.A.F. General Peterson watches with other Air Force
OFFICERS and TECHNICIANS.


Fisk and Giler enter, pulling off their suit hoods.  Their faces are
beet red from the heat.


						CPT.  GILER 
		What it's all about, sir: Willy Peter burns steel, burns
		titanium; it'll sure burn up your poison and everything else in the
		atmosphere.


						GENERAL PETERSON 
		I need four F-16's equipped with air-to-ground missiles
		within... 
					(consults wristwatch) 
		.... twenty-six hours.


						LT. FISK 
		Let me name some things that are more possible, General, with
		all due respect: winning the Lottery, climbing Mt. Everest barefoot,
		getting a parking space at Yankee Stadium, marrying Sharon Stone ...


						CPT.  GILER 
		Can't do it, General.

						GENERAL PETERSON 
		You can.  And you will.


General Peterson walks off.


						CPT.  GILER 
		Get yer minds off Budweiser, baseball, and broads, fellahs -
		we're goin, ,round the clock!

his ear.


THREE F.B.I. AGENTS (CORD, STAR and HUNT) sit down the bench, talking
amongst themselves.


						CARLA 
						(V.O.) 
						(recorded voice message)

She exits, slamming the door.

INT.  F.B.I. VAN - BACK COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS , GOODSPEED 
clicks off the phone, thinking, nervous.GOODSPEED 
notices that MASON is staring at him.


						MASON  
						(sotto) 
		Who's Carla?  And why don't you want her to come to San
		Francisco?


GOODSPEED doesn't answer.  He notices the F.B.I. AGENTS staring at Mason
and him. He straightens up.


			GOODSPEED 
		You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.

						
						MASON  
		You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed?

The van STOPS: the rear doors open to the FAIRMONT HOTEL SERVICE
ENTRANCE.

						(points at elevator) 
		Only one exit.


IN THE SUITE'S BATHROOM

Steamy, from the shower.  F.B.I. Agent Cord sits on the sink.  MASON'S
VOICE emanates from the shower.  He's singing some ditty off-key.  But
MASON isn't washing.



INSIDE THE SHOWER STALL -- Mason's tampering with the BELL HOUSING of
THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE on the shower wall.


MASON pops off the bell-housing. he pulls out the nylon clothesline cord
(it's thick, about 10 ft.) and rips it from the bell housing.  Tests its
strength.


Satisfied, he knots A NOOSE on one end of the clothesline cord, then
coils.


IN THE BATHROOM - MASON  
emerges from the shower wearing a huge hotel
bathrobe.


Cord hands him a SUIT OF CLOTHES.  MASON  
inspects them.


						MARSHAL CORD 
		Put 'em on.  You've got forty-five minutes.

						MASON  
		You going to stand there and watch?



						MARSHAL CORD 
		That's right.

						MASON  
		well if it excites-you ...



						MARSHAL CORD 
		Put the goddamn clothes on.



IN THE SUITE'S LIVING ROOM Womack is dumping the contents of a BARBER'S
BAG on the sideboard.

Hands THE HOTEL BARBER, a swishy guy, a COMB, ELECTRIC TRIMMER and BIB. 
The BARBER frowns.


						BARBER 
		I can't do a decent job with these.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		That's all you get.

						BARBER 
		I'm an artist, not a barber.

						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
						(holds up scissors) 
		without these he can't stab you in the throat.

MASON, dressed, emerges from the bathroom.  Motions the barber toward
the balcony.

						MASON  
		Shall we do this outside?  In the sunshine?

The barber gulps.  Follows MASON onto the balcony.

ON THE SUITE'S BALCONY MASON  
sits in the sun on a balcony chair.  Bib
on.

						BARBER 
		How would you like it sir?

						MASON  
		whatever's in style.

						BARBER 
		oh fabulous.  You look shabby.  Shall I snip and cut the
		shabbiness away?

The barber begins trimming Mason's hair...

THE BALCONY - SOME MINUTES LATER Mason's hair and beard are neatly
trimmed.  The barber holds a mirror up; MASON  
examines himself.



						MASON  
		Good.  Thank-you.

The barber stands.  Clears his throat.  Rubs his thumb and forefinger
together.


						MASON  
		Yes of course.  My secretary will take care of you.- 
						(to Agent Star)
		See to the good man will you?

Agent Star, glaring at Mason, leads the Barber out.

						MASON  
		What say we bury the hatchet, Womack.

MASON extends his hand.  Womack looks at it.  As Womack reluctantly
takes Mason's hand, MASON slides the noose over Womack's wrist.  He
yanks it tight and shoulders director womack bodily over the balustrade.

						MASON  
		In your head.

Womack plunges, HOWLING, 9 stories to his death.  No, he only falls 10
feet.  SPROOOOOING he stops, hanging by his wrist off the side of the
building, held there by --

-- MASON  
on the balcony, clutching the other end of the nylon
clothesline, staring at Goodspeed.



			GOODSPEED 
		Jesus...  JESUS CHRIST....


GOODSPEED fumbles for his gun.  Finally unholsters it. DIRECTOR WOMACK,
hanging below, is SCREAMING.



						MASON  
		- Drop the gun or I'll drop your boss.



EXT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY Two F.B.I. AGENTS,
loitering by their vehicle, look up at WOMACK, dangling off the side of
the building.



						F.B.I. AGENT 
		Holy shit, we got a jumper.

						F.B.I. AGENT 2
		Looks like....  Womack... !



ENT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY MASON  
and GOODSPEED as before.

						MASON  
		Whoops .... I'm feeling tired .... Whoops .... MASON

		drops his gun and grabs the clothesline.  MASON  
		bolts from the balcony into the suitels library.

AGENT STAR sprints onto the balcony.  Star and GOODSPEED 
begin hauling Womack up as -- .

MASON steals through the suite, through the vestibule, and into the elevator.


ON THE BALCONY - Agent Star and GOODSPEED 
hoist Directory Womack, red-faced and sputtering, over the railing.  			
GOODSPEED grabs Star's walkie-talkie.

goes down on the huge dishwasher.  MASON moves off quickly toward the side exit.

						RADIO NEWSMAN 
		This just in: More than twenty highway patrolmen are
		involved in a highspeed chase on Van Ness Boulevard, north of Trocadero

EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - (BOTTOM OF HILL #2) - DAY At the
intersection here, TWO S.F. ROAD WORKERS are sliding a STEEL PLATE over
a 6 ft. deep ditch cut in the asphalt (for a water main or equivalent).


The Road Workers, hearing the WAIL OF MASON'S HUMVEE, look up and dive
away just at THE HUMVEE blasts over he steel plate, dislodging it from
its positioning.  It TEETERS on the lip of the ditch.


THE F.B.I. SEDAN hits the teetering steel plate, which collapses --
causing the sedan to be swallowed up halfway into the ditch, it's rear

the smoke and fire.

A YOUNG KID ON A MOTORCYCLE rolls up.


MOTORCYCLE KID You just fucked up your Ferrari, man.


			GOODSPEED 
		It's not mine.

						MOTORCYCLE KID

EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - PIAZZA DES ARTES - DAY MASON  
stands next to a massive column, writing on a piece of paper: 
"ST.  MICHAEL'S CHURCH, FORT WALTON, KANSAS.  FRONT PEW.  RIGHT LEG.  HOLLOW."


ACROSS THE PARK - JADE ANGELOU enters a city park with a rotunda of
classical design.  A walk-way under massive Corinthian columns.  She
moves through the rotunda.


MASON  sees her.  He steps behind the column as she passes. There is a
moment of indecision.  MASON looks at THE PIECE OF PAPER in his hand.



						MASON  
		Jade.


Jade Angelou stops cold.  Slow-ly turns.  And regards Mason.


ACROSS THE ROTUNDA - GOODSPEED sees MASON  and Jade. he stealthily moves
toward them.



BY THE COLUMN - MASON AND JADE Jade approaches MASON  
tentatively.  He is stunned by her. By her beauty, her bearing, her 
likeness to'him.



						MASON  
		Hello.  Yes.  It's me.



						JADE 
		I uhm...  I'm not quite sure what to say. This is all a bit much
		...


Several POLICE CARS ROAR past, sirens BLARING.  MASON  
pockets the PIECE
OF PAPER.


						MASON  
		Let's uhm...  let's walk a ways.


They walk off next to a TALL HEDGE. GOODSPEED 
follows on the other side of the hedge.  INTERCUT between MASON  
and Jade, and Goodspeed eavesdropping. GOODSPEED 
pulls out his cellular phone, begins punching numbers.


						JADE 
		So  how long have you been out?

						MASON  
		A while.

						JADE 
		A while.  And you didn't call?  You are free now, right?


						MASON  
		I'm here with you, aren't I?

						JADE 
		Why now?  I mean why today.


						MASON  
		I was driving through San Francisco.  I decided it was time.


						JADE 
		Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from
		San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result. 
		You can imagine I'm pretty confused.


						MASON  
		I tried to explain in my letters.
	

						JADE 
		Ahh.  Your letters.  They weren't very easy to follow.


She fishes in her pocket.  Pulls out A LETTER.  WHOLE SECTIONS OF THE
LETTER have been scissored out.  Mason. frowns.


						MASON  
		I see. 
						(grumbles) 
		Bloody prison censors.


						JADE 
		How about explaining now?


In the b.g. we HEAR POLICE SIRENS.  MASON  
looks around.


						MASON  
		Maybe this isn't the best time... 
						(off her look) 
		Jade.  Here sitdown.


MASON and Jade sit on a bench.  MORE SIRENS in the b.9. MASON  
looks off
nervously.


						MASON  
		All will be explained.  You must trust me on this. Someday very soon, 
		after I get a few things settled, I will come back for you.  What I 
		need to know is: do you want me in your life?


						JADE 
		How can I answer that?  I don't know if we can.... after 19 years,
		just start like that.


						MASON  
		We are the same blood.


						JADE 
		But I don't know you.


						MASON 
		where to begin. 
						(sighs) 
		My name is John Paul Mason.  I'm Scottish.
		I attended Dartmouth Naval College.  My favorite color is green.  I
		like books.  I like a good joke.  At one time I shot a pretty fair round
		of golf.  I'm in my 60's and I've been in jail half my life. 
						(Jade looks away) 
		Maybe it's better I go.

She smiles.  Puts her hands on his.

						JADE 
		No. You're doing okay.


Police sirens BLARE.  And the entire park.is suddenly surrounded by
F.B.I. AND POLICE VEHICLES.


						JADE 
		You lied to me.


GOODSPEED approaches.  MASON makes no attempt to move.  Jade turns to
him.


			GOODSPEED 
						(flashes his I.D.) 
		F.B.I. miss.  Your father is working with us.  He's helping us resolve a.... 
						(looks at Mason)
		.... dangerous situation.


						JADE 
		He is?


			GOODSPEED 
		Yes madam.  We've got to go, John.

MASON  extends his hand to Jade.  She takes it.

						MASON  
		Jade - remember what I said.


They hug.  Then MASON walks off with GOODSPEED and --

-- Jade opens her hand, revealing the PIECE OF PAPER upon which Mason
wrote his instructions.


ACROSS THE PARK - F.B.I. AGENTS STAR and CORD run up.

			GOODSPEED 
						(sharply) 
		No cuffs until we get to the cars,


They continue toward the waiting cars.

						MASON  
		You surprise me, Goodspeed.  Now I'm going to surprise myself:
		thank-you, you could have handled that differently.



			GOODSPEED 
						(tight) 
		You almost got me killed.  Twice.



						MASON  
		Hows your jaw?


GOODSPEED wheels on MASON and swings.  SNATCH.  MASON  
catches Goodspeed's fist.  Three inches from his face.

			GOODSPEED 
		It hurts.


SANCHEZ, DIRECTOR WOMACK and the F.B.I. AGENTS approach. Womack's arm is
in a sling; he's in a volcanic rage.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		You cocksucker you dislocated my shoulder and
		cost the city of San Francisco ten million dollars.  You try to escape
		again and Agent Chaney here will break your legs.


AGENT CHANEY, large and mean, comes to Mason's side.

						MASON  
		Pleased to meet you.

						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Okay, one more time: down this second fork

		then forty-two paces to the prison showers ...


						MASON  
		No. Forty-two paces to the septic chamber.  Fifty-seven to the
		showers.



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
						(pointedly) 
		That's not what you said three minutes
		ago.



						MASON  
						(innocently) 
		It's not?


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
					(dagger stare at Mason)
		Excuse me. 
						(rises)
		Womack.


Womack follows Anderson aside.  They confer heatedly.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's
		tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play "twenty
		questions."


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		He knows every inch of those tunnels, Commander.



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Then he's keeping it to himself.  He's fucking with
		me and I don't have the time.



						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
						(pause; he thinks) 
		What if he went with you?



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Out of the question.  He'll endanger the mission -
		he'll endanger my men.  He's a security risk.  Who says he won't bolt as
		soon as we turn our backs on him?

						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		I'll handle that.  Chaney.

The hulking Chaney escorts MASON over.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		You're not cooperating, John.  Maybe this will
		help.  I'm sure you're curious about what's happening on Alcatraz. 
						(no response) 
		Twelve United States Marines - a terrorist rogue force - have
		seized it.  They've aimed fifteen poison gas rockets at the city. 
		Enough poison gas to kill every man, woman and child in San Francisco.
						(smiles) 
		Yes, John, including your daughter.


						MASON  
	You son-of-fucking-Satan.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOA WOMACK 
		Mr. MASON has a strong incentive to help us,
		Commander Anderson.


MASON boils.  Then springs at Womack.  Chaney grabs Mason, headlocking
him.  So MASON  knees Womack in the balls.  Womack doubles over. 
Recovers, coughing.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Get him some gear.  He's going to the Rock. 
		Goodspeed!


ACROSS THE ROOM - GOODSPEED 
looks up from a computer screen generating
3-D images of different angles of a V.X. ROCKET.  He walks over to the
table.  Anderson and the other S.E.A.L.s stare at him.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize
		the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed.  Tell us what you know.


			GOODSPEED 
		Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. 
		Here.  The prison morgue. 
						(points)
		It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense.  V.X. gas 
		begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

			GOODSPEED 
		No sir, but I've studied them ....



						COMMANDER  ANDERSON 
						(sarcastic) 
		That's great, Goodspeed.  You're in the
		Bureau, so you've had weapons training.


			GOODSPEED 
		A little, sir.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		So you've never been in a combat situation.



			GOODSPEED 
		No sir. 
						(beat) 
		Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Won't be necessary.


			GOODSPEED 
		Sir, these are very complicated devices...


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		I know they are, Goodspeed.  That's why you're going
		with us.


			GOODSPEED 
		Sir?


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
						(to S.E.A.L. Reigert)
		Get him some gear.

MASON stares at Goodspeed.

						MASON  
		Wait just a minute.  This little twat's going to deal with the
		poison?  He's gonna get us all fuckin' killed!

MASON walks off muttering.

INT.  PIER.39 COMMAND CENTER - BATHROOM - A MINUTE LATER

S.E.A.L. Dando stands at a urinal. GOODSPEED bursts in and lunges for
another urinal.  He vomits.  Gags.  Spits.

						S.E.A.L. DANDO 
		Nice to meet you too. 

SANCHEZ  enters.

						SANCHEZ  
		You look like shit. 
		
GOODSPEED leans back against the wall.

			GOODSPEED 
		Thank you.

						SANCHEZ  
		You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.

			GOODSPEED 
		I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill,
		you're too fucking smart for field work." Every year I put in for a
		transfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking
		Maytag repairman in the commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and
		it's a whole fuckin, city at stake?  Oh Jesus...



						SANCHEZ  
		Chemical Weapons isn't a cakewalk, Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED splashes cold water on his face.

			GOODSPEED 
		I've got some bad news and some really bad news sir.  Maybe
		the bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good ....



						SANCHEZ  
		Spit it out.

			GOODSPEED 
		My girlfriend's pregnant.



						SANCHEZ  
						(pause) 
		What's the really bad news.


INT.  PIER 39 - OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - DAY

						SANCHEZ  
						(V.0.) 
		Goodspeed, GODDAMN IT ...

The door bursts open.  Sanchez, veins bulging, exits, followed by
Goodspeed.

						SANCHEZ  
		Agent Cord, get over to the Pan Pacific Hotel and bring
		Goodspeed's girlfriend to this facility please!!

and CUT TO:

Cpts.  Darrow and Frye look out . the window at the Marine's Command
Center in the Infirmary.

						CAPTAIN DARROW

INT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - SUNSET 

Hummel sits at hisdesk.  The phone RINGS.

						HUMMEL 
						(V.O.) 
		Hummel.

						SECURITY ADVISOR LOUIS LINDSTROM 
		Hello Frank, Lou Lindstrom.  I'm in the
		oval office with General Kramer.


INTERCUT - ALCATRAZ INFIRMARY / WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE

						GENERAL KRAMER  
		We're having some problems with the account transfer,
		Frank.


						HUMMEL 
		Don't tell me your problems, tell me your solutions.


						GENERAL KRAMER  
		We've spoken to the President. He's not too happy about
		this.

Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair enters.

						HUMMEL 
		Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance ...



						HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		The only thing the President will give you is a fair
		trial after you're caught, General.


						HUMMEL 
		That you, Sinclair?  What exactly do you do at the White House?
		Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine? 
		Are you his golf caddy, Sinclair?


						HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
		Now you give me some coddamn respect, General ....

						HUMMEL 
		You want respect, you child, you coffee server?  Let's talk about
		Dave Ridgeway.


						GENERAL KRAMER  
		Who's Dave Ridgeway, Frank?


						HUMMEL 
		A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist
		death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle.  His mother and young wife were
		told by the Pentagon that he went A.W.O.L. Let's talk about the respect
		he got.


						LOUIS LINDSTROM  
		This is going nowhere Frank ....


						HUMMEL 
 		Then let me tell you what is: The most lethal poison gas known to
		man into San Franciscols business district.  You have twelve hours to
		deliver the money or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.


CLICK.  National Security Advisor Lindstrom stares at the phone.  Shakes
his head.


						LOUIS LINDSTROM  
		What's the word from Mojave?


						GENERAL KRAMER  
		General Petersen can give us no definite assurance on the
		Willy Peter capability.

The men stare grimly at each other.


						LOUIS LINDSTROM  
		Greenlight the S.E.A.L. incursion.


General Kramer picks up the phone and CUT TO:

EXT.  NAVAL AIRSTRIP (INCURSION STAGING AREA) - DUSK- The INCURSION
STAGING AREA (a base in the S.F. vicinity) GOODSPEED 
and MASON, in black dry suits, join COMMANDER ANDERSON 
and nine other S.E.A.L.s.

Four S.E.A.L.s will be identified: BOYER, REIGERT, DANDO, and SHEPHERD.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Listen up, men.  Mr. MASON  
		here will run point for us.  Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your 
		hip, Mason.  You breath, he breathes with you.  Understand?


LIEUTENANT SHEPHERD, young, laconic, nods at Mason.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Shep, what's the status on the special operational
		gear for Mason.



						S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD 
						(hands over items) 
		one aluminum fork and one quart of
		motor oil in a squeeze tube.


			GOODSPEED 
		Motor oil?

						MASON  
		For cottonmouth. 

GOODSPEED and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.

						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		GOODSPEED here's our specialist.  We will cover him
		while he neutralizes the' chemical threat.  If he does his job we'll
		launch flares and hold our position 'till the cavalry comes.  Make no
		mistake about it, gentlemen, we are going in against an entrenched force
		led by one hot-shit field commander.  We are in the fight of our lives,
		I bullshit you not.  Any questions?  Let's move out.


The move across the staging area to --

A CH-53 SEA STALLION and two HUEY COBRA ATTACK GUNSHIPS, their BLADES
whipping with ferocity.


S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD stands in the Sea Stallion's door.  The S.E.A.L.s
board past him.  Last are MASON and Goodspeed.



						MASON  
		After you, 'lace."


GOODSPEED gives MASON  a look and climbs in.  Then Mason. Then Shepherd,
who SLAMS the door shut.

THE GROUND CREW waves red LIGHT SABRES: "all clear." The Hueys and the
Sea Stallion lift off.


INT.  SEA STALLION - NIGHT

GOODSPEED and MASON sit with the S.E.A.L.s. Grim, determined faces.  
Not a word spoken.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Activate mini-cams.


Anderson, Boyer and the other S.E.A.L.s flip on TINY VIDEOCAMERAS
mounted on their shoulders.  A NAVAL MEDIC passes out SYRINGES OF
ATROPINE in ANKLE SHFATHES.


						NAVAL MEDIC  
		Atropine.  Any contact with the gas, use it.


Each S.E.A.L. takes one; begins strapping it to ankle. GOODSPEED 
shakes his head, declining.


			GOODSPEED 
		Uhn uhn.  I hate needles.



INT.  PIER 39 - MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS TRAILER - NIGHT

AT THE CONTROL PANEL - F.B.I. TECHNICIANS talk into headsets and watch a
bank of MONITORS displaying: satellite pictures, thermographic images of
Alcatraz, a computer bio of Hummel.


SANCHEZ sits at the control panel wearing a headset. Director Womack
paces behind him.



						SANCHEZ  
		Mini-cams operational.



OUTSIDE IN THE WAREHOUSE

An F.B.I. SEDAN pulls in and parks.  F.B.I. AGENT CORD gets out. carla
sits in the back seat.



						CARLA 
		Would you please tell me what is going on?



						AGENT CORD 
		Can't do that, malam.  Sorry.



EXT.  SKIES OVER SAN FRANCISCO BAY - NIGHT

The Hueys and Sea Stallion fly in formation AT CAMERA.  The Sea
Stallion's running lights suddenly BLINK OFF.



INT.  SF.A STALLION - NIGHT 

The two SEA STALLION PILOTS don NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

IN THE HOLD - THE S.E.A.L.s begin to prepare themselves; checking their
weapons combat wet-suits, and CLOSED CIRCUIT REBREATHER SCUBA TANKS.

The S.E.A.L.s begin to don their scuba apparatus.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		You know what you're doing?


						MASON  
		Yes.  Little fancier than I'm used to.


MASON examines the equipment.  It's more modern, but not foreign to him.
 He adjusts his depth and oxygen gauges.  Goodspeed, having a hard time,
watches Mason.



EXT.  SKIES OVER SAN FRANCISCO BAY - NIGHT

THE HUEYS, 50 ft. from the water's surface, SCREAM PAST CAMERA and bear
down on Alcatraz.


THE SEA STALLION, lagging behind the Hueys, BANKS RIGHT and peels away. 
It descends lower, below radar.


INT.  PIER 39 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

The F.B.I. RADAR TECHNICIAN watches the RADAR SCREEN. ..Glowing BLIPS
move toward Alcatraz.  One BLIP vanishes.



F.B.I. RADAR TECHNICIAN 
They're off radar, headin' 'round Treasure
Island.



EXT.  SKIES OVER TREASURE ISLAND - NIGHT

The Sea Stallion rounds Treasure Island and heads toward the rear of
Alcatraz Island.



INT.  SEA STALLION - NIGHT

The SEA STALLION PILOT turns to ANDERSON.

SEA STALLION PILOT I got you to the strongest current in the Bay,
Commander.  You're on your own from here.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Prepare to deplore!


CUT TO: A SERIES OF SHOTS.

The S.E.A.L.s stand.  Each checks the gear of the man in front of him. 
Straps tightened.  Weapons checked. -

IN THE REAR OF THE HOLD-- FOUR S.E.A.L.s ready two high-tech 139B 3-man
submersibles called 'IS.D.U.sll (Seal Delivery Units), also known as
"Seal Subs."


MASON is ready to go, calm and steady, eyes forward. GOODSPEED'S still
behind.  He has his scuba tanks shouldered, but he can't get the 
lst of the tricky cATcHEs on the shoulder harness secured ...

MASON reaches over and secures, with a METALLIC DLINK, the catch. 
Goodspeed, embarrassed, nods.


AT THE BACK OF THE HOLD

139F SHEPHERD, with a nod, directs MASON  
to sit down on the S.D.U.
behind S.E.A.L. BOYER, the S.D.U.ls driver.


MASON does so.  Chaney then sits behind Mason.  S.E.A.L. Dando then
begins buckling Shepherd and MASON  
onto the sled with harnesses (the unit's version of a seat-belt.)


EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO BAY (OFF ALCATRAZ) - NIGHT

The Sea Stallion hovers 15 ft. from the surface.  The BELLY DOOR opens. 
COMMANDER ANDERSON leans out, inspecting the drop area. he hand-signals
to --



-- S.E.A.L. DANDO, reading the two S.D.U.s. GOODSPEED 
sits on the SECOND S.D.U. behind S.E.A.L. REIGERT.  S.E.A.L. Dando begins 
buckling in Goodspeed.



			GOODSPEED 
		Wait a minute.
						(Dando stops buckling) 
		What if this thing crashes ...


Dando looks at Reigert.  They laugh.  This remark they
obviously find very funny.  Dando continues buckling GOODSPEED 
in.


						MASON  
		Smile Goodspeed.  Live a little.  Life is short...  especially
		yours.


And the S.D.U.ls are released, rolling out of the Sea Stallion on a set
of tracks, SPLASHING DOWN into --



EXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
-- the bay here.  The S.D.U.s' XENON headlamps
come on.

EXT.  THE SEA STALLION - DOORWAY - NIGHT 
The rest of the S.E.A.L.s,
carrying equipment and single man mini-S.D.U. units, jump from the Sea
Stallion one by one.



EXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
The three-man and single S.D.U.s head toward
Alcatraz, passing ABOVE CAMERA.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT 
THE SEARCHLIGHT atop the lower
lighthouse scans the bay, back and forth.  It fixes on something.


INT.  ALCATRAZ - LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT 
Hummel and Baxter watch from
the window.  Captain Fryels voice emanates from the walkie-talkie.


						CAPTAIN FRYE 
						(V.O.) 
		Something on radar, sir.  Two Hueys in standard
		formation, due east and approaching.


Hummel raises binoculars.  Scans the bay.

HUMMEL'S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE HUEYS AND SEA STALLION, flying
low, SCREAM toward the island.


BACK TO SCENE - HUMMEL lowers the binoculars, clicks on his
walkie-talkie.


						BAXTER 
		Decoy?


						HUMMEL 
		Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble, Starling: get to the west end of the
		island on the double.  Think we have visitors.


EXT.  ALCATRAZ - WATER TOWER - ALLEY - NIGHT

Pvt.  Royce clicks off his walkie-talkie.

						ROYCE  
		You heard the man, let's move it.

Pvts.  Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble and.Starling race off.

EXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT The S.E.A.L.s, pulled by their S.D.U.s, WHOOSH
past camera. The S.D.U.s lights dim the FLUORESCENT GREEN.


CLOSE-UP on BOYER, the three-man S.D.U.ls driver, intense, determined.
CLOSE-UP on Boyer's fluorescent green INSTRUMENT PANEL charting their
approach to the island.


They've drawn close to the island.  ' COMMANDER ANDERS6N swings an
UNDERWATER SPOTLIGHT, which reveals --


A LARGE WATER INTAKE PIPE jutting out from the Island's bedrock, 7 ft.
in diameter, covered by a GRATE thick with rust, barnacles and seaweed. 
There's a SMALL JAGGED HOLE, presumably through which MASON  
escaped 33
years earlier.



EXT.  UNDERWATER - POWER P     . INTAKE PIPE - NIGHT The S.E.A.L.s cast
off the S.D.U.s and direct their GREEN FLUORESCENT SPOTLIGHTS inside the
hole in the grate.



MASON  stares at the hole.  COMMANDER ANDERSON 
nods to Mason: "lead the way." MASON  does so.  Enters the pipe. one by one, 
the S.E.A.L.s and GOODSPEED follow MASON in.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - SHORELINE NEAR POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Pvts.  Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble and Starling walk the shoreline, peering
into the black water.



						ROYCE  
		Looks all clear, sir.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 

Baxter turns to Hummel:


						BAXTER 
		Nothing.


						HUMMEL 
		Tell 'em to stay out there.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - SUBTERRANEAN POWER PLANT - NIGHT

A large subterranean room under the island's . power plant. 	large
WOODEN CISTERN in the middle.



The S.E.A.L.s emerge in the cistern and climb out.  The room . has one
exit, sealed with a HEAVY IRON door.



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us
		to a room with no exit.



						S.E.A.L. BOYER 
		Skipper, blow it or burn it?



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		No time for the torch.  Explosives'll bring the
		fucking world down on us. (turns to Mason) An idea, please, we're tight
		on time.



						MASON  
		Wait for me to unlock the door.

						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		You do not look like Jesus Christ, Mr. Mason, so I'm
		having a hard time how you're going to accomplish that.


						MASON  
						(points)
		Under there.


UNDERNEATH THE STEAM ENGINE is a tiny crawl space. 10 STEAM RELEASE
VALVES periodically emit BURSTS OF STEAM.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		You are shitting me.  You catch one of those steam
		bursts and you're a corpse.



						MASON  
		True. 
				(unshoulders his equipment)
		I memorized their timing.


MASON sits on the edge of the crawl space.  F.B.I. looks inside the
crawl space: WHITE HOT BURSTS of 500 degree Fahrenheit steam BLAST DOWN.



						S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD 
		Uhh sir, you said never leave his side ...



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		You're not required to follow, Lieutenant Shepherd. 
		This man is going to die.


						MASON  
				(grumbles to himself) 
		That's been said to me before ....


MASON takes a deep breath and he rolls --

INTO THE CRAWL SPACE - MASON  
logrolls one revolution...  STEAM

BURST another evolution STEAM BURST another revolution STEAM BURST


MASON  rolls to a stop on his side.  STEAM BURSTS on either side of him. 
MASON collects himself.  Breathes deeply and rolls again.  His movements
are precise, from memory.  He rolls past.each burst, any imprecision
certain death ...



IN THE CISTERN ROOM - GOODSPEED, ANDERSON AND THE S.E.A.L.s watch Mason,
amazed.


						S.E.A.L. REIGERT 
		Who the fuck is this guy?  Houdini?


IN THE CRAWL SPACE - MASON  
rolls past the STEAM RELEME VALVE and
disappears.

IN THE CISTERN ROOM - Several seconds pass.  We HEAR THE DOOR being
unbolted.  It CREAKS open.  There stands Mason.


						MASON  
		Welcome to the Rock.

The Incursion Team files through the door and CUT TO:

INT.  TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ - NIGHT Here, the tunnel moves up a steep
incline to a LOCKED STEEL BULKHEAD.  S.E.A.L.s REIGERT and DANDO check
it out.



						S.E.A.L. DANDO 
		She's at least three inches thick sir.



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Shit.  Burn it.

Dando unpacks an ACETYLENE TORCH.  Reigert turns on the ACETYLENE VALVES
(tanks rigged to Dandols gear) and sparks the torch.  IT FLAMES UP,
white hot.


Dando starts toward the bulkhead.  MASON steps past him, bending his
KITCHEN FORK into an awkward shape.  He fishes the fork in the lock;
twists it, and...... POP.


MASON  throws open the thick bulkhead door.  And climbs through the
bulkhead.


						MASON  
						(muttering) 
		Guys are worthless.

						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Who is this guy... ?

INT.  DRAINAGE PIPES LTNDER MAIN CELL HOUSE - NIGHT The team arrives at
a series of concrete drainage pipes. MASON  
points up to one of them.



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		The shower room? 
						(MASON nods yes) 
		After you.



MASON and the S.E.A.L.s climb into the drainage pipe.

INT.  DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT The S.E.A.L. team, Mason
leading the way, climbs toward a FAINT LIGHT emanating from a DRAINAGE
GRATE above.


S.E.A.L. REIGERT readies a FIBRE OPTIC SEEING DEVICE; he pushes the
fibre-optic camera up through the grate.


INT.  ALCATRAZ - PRISON SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

The FIBER-OPTIC CAMERA turns, looking in a 360 degree radius, and
transmitting images of --


THE PRISON SHOWER - a tiled room with shower heads and a 20 160A ft.
ceiling.  Above, a mezzanine circles the showers; here Alcatraz's guards
once watched inmates below..


INT.  DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

Commander Anderson views the shower room images on a TINY (2 inch by 2
inch) WRIST-HELD VIDEO MONITOR.  The shower is deserted, but there's
something of interest ~-

A MOTION DETECTOR (a blue beam flashed from a transmitter to 161A a
receptor) across the grate.



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Motion sensor.

Anderson gingerly lifts the grate.  Reigert wiggles his hands past the
edges of the grate and nudges the beam transmitter (with one hand) and
the beam receiver (with the other) away from the grate.



INT.  INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

A SILENT ALARM next to Pvt.  Royce blinks on.  Royce turns to Maj. 
Baxter.



						ROYCE  
		Sir.  Anti-disturbance temblar tripped in the shower.  We got
		visitors.



INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - SHOWER ROOM

The grate pops open.  S.E.A.IL.s BOYER and REIGERT, wearing NIOHT VISION
GLASSES, emerge taking defensive positions back-to-back.  Commander
Anderson follows.  Then, one by one, the rest of the S.E.A.L.s emerge.



						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
			(to Lt.  Shepherd in the drainage pipe) 
		Stand fast. We'll secure the area.



ANDERSON directs Boyer and Reigert to a TILED COLUMN.  They creep across
the tiled floor, taking "check and defefid" positions behind the
shower's TILED COLUMNS.  But suddenly, shockingly.....FLOODLIGHTS flash
on.  Coming from the mezzanine above.


The S.E.A.L.s whip off their night vision goggles.

165 INT.  PIER 3-9 - MOBILE COMMAND TRAILER - NIGHT


ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - We see the illumination of the shower room
(transmitted from the S.E.A.L.s cameras.)


						SANCHEZ  
		What's that...what the hell is that?


INT.  ALCATRAZ - DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT Goodspeed,
Mason, and Lt.  Shepherd react to the sudden illumination above. 
			
			GOODSPEED 
			(whispers:)
		What's going on?

						S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD 
						   (whispers) 
		Don't know.

INT.  SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

The S.E.A.L.s whirl around, startled, unnerved, squinting into the
blinding whiteness of the floodlights.



						HUMMEL 
						 (V.O.) 
		Drop your weapons.


The S.E.A.L.s, terrified, hesitate but do not drop their weapons They
stand back-to-back, weapons trained at the catwalk. squinting into the
white light.


The S.E.A.L.s behind the tiled columns take cover. we cannot yet see
Hummel and the marines.  This plays with as much tension as possible. 
The situation is chilling:


COMMANDER ANDERSON 
Anderson here, General Hummel. Commander.  Team
Leader.


						HUMMEL 
						(V.O.) 
		Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives
		of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them
		on the deck at their feet-



INT.  PIER 39 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - We see the floodlights above on the Mezzanine and
hear Hummells voice:

						SANCHEZ  
		Oh Christ this isn't happening.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - SHOWER ROOM MEZZANINE- NIGHT

HUMMEL looks down at the S.E.A.L.s. Baxter's text to him.  The other
marines are at positions around the mezzanine perimeter, M-16's trained
and ready.

						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		Sir, we know why you're out here.  God knows I agree
		with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against
		all enemies.  Foreign, sir, and domestic. (shouts now) General, we've
		spilled the same blood in the same mud.  You know goddamn well that I
		cannot give that order...



BEHIND A COLUMN - S.E.A.L.s REIGERT and BOYER stare into the
floodlights.



						HUMMEL 
		Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.  I'm
		not going to ask again.


ON THE MEZZANINE

CPTS.  FRYE, DARROW and PVTS.  COX, MCCOY, have their weapons trained;
they're pumped and trigger happy.


						HUMMEL 
		Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here.


						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
		You men following the General: You are United States
		Marines and under oath you forgotten that?  We all have shipmates we
		remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that
		doesn't give you the right to mutiny.



						HUMMEL 
		That's a nice speech, Commander.  I heard plenty like it in the
		Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.  They all added up to zero.  Pretty words
		aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander.  Now abort this mission. 
		Goddamn it, abort.


BEHIND THE COLUMN - S.E.A.L. BOYER, just 20, having never seen combat,
is trembling with fear, indecision.


						S.E.A.L. BOYER 
		It's us or them, Reigert, fuck they're gonna waste us ...

						S.E.A.L. REIGERT 
		Get a grip on yourself ....

ON THE MEZZANINE - PVT.  COXIS BOOT nudges a TILE which has come loose
from its mortar.  The tile inches to the edge of the mezzanine.  Then it
falls ......


BOYER, reacting to THE FALLING TILE, brings up his machine gun and fires
A SUSTAINED BURST in its direction --


And all hell breaks loose.  THE MARINES fire in unison.  A cruel
withering fusillade.


--- THE S.E.A.L.s in the middle of the floor take the brunt of it. They
gamely return fire.  But they're hit.  Again.  Again.  Again.


IN THE DRAINAGE HOLE - Goodspeed, Mason, and Lt.  Shepherd listen (and
watch, when the view allows) in utter horror to the firefight above.


Lt. Shepherd scrambles up the ladder. GOODSPEED 
grabs him. Tries to pull him down.


			GOODSPEED 
		Don' t do it.


						S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD 
		Let go of me.


Lt.  Shepherd climbs the ladder.

IN THE SHOWER ROOM - ANDERSON takes a bullet in his leg.  His automatic
blazing, he takes a bullet in the forearm.  The chest.  The shoulder.

-- THREE MARINES on the mezzanine are hit and killed.

-- LT.  SHEPHERD climbs out of the drainage pipe and comes up firing. 
He instantly takes a bullet through the visor, killing him instantly. 
SHEPHERD falls to his knees and pitches over, falling face first into --



THE DRAINAGE HOLE, where SHEPHERD'S lifeless eyes come face-to-face with
Goodspeed, who nearly passes out, then looks away in horror.



S.E.A.L.S BEHIND THE COLUMNS return fire.  They're hit, picked off.one
by one.



-- MARINE COX AND MCCOY fire a 50 CAL.  GUN (as powerful as
anti-aircraft or anti-tank round) through the column, killing REIGERT
and BOYER.



						HUMMEL 
		HOLD YOUR FIRE HOLD YOUR FIRE ....

INT.  DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

Suddenly the-firing stops. GOODSPEED 
and MASON  freeze.  Thinking fast,
MASON  rips the TAC RADIO from Shepherd's helmet, takes his 9 MM PISTOL
and MACHINE GUN, and his SAW-TOOTHED KNIFE AND SHEATH, and climbs down.


Goodspeed, indecisive at first, clambers down after Mason.

INT.  PIER 39 - MOBILE COMMAND TRAILER - NIGHT ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - An

so this is at ground level.  We see corpses and near corpses.



						SANCHEZ  
		It's over.


						F.B.I. TECHNICIAN 
		We've still got movement.  Numbers eleven and twelve. 
		That's GOODSPEED and.... Mason.


						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		If mason's still alive, it's not over.


INT.  ALCATRAZ - TUNNELS UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

MASON and GOODSPEED exit the drainage pipe. GOODSPEED is panting, nearly hysterical.

			GOODSPEED 
		We're never gettin off this island.

INT.  PIER 39 - WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

CARLA peers through a crowd of F.B.I. TECHS huddled around video and
audio monitors.  She freezes, her hands covering to her mouth at the
sound of:



			GOODSPEED 
						(over tac radio) 
		.... god Jesus we're gonna die


Sanchez, agitated, exits the Command Trailer with Director Womack.  They
huddle, speaking in hushed voices.



			SANCHEZ  
		You told me I am on a "need to know" basis.  Well goddamn it, I
		need to know.  Who the fuck is John Mason.  Start talking, Director, or
		I swear I will go to the press.


A tense pause.  Then Womack sighs, and his voice travels back three
decades ...

Goodspeed, slumped in a corner, watches MASON  
arm himself.


He is a different person.  Alive.  Now in his element. pops the clip on
Shepherd's g mil gun.  Inspects it.  Unsheathes the saw-toothed knife. 
Sheathes it.


174 INTERCUT - PIER 39 COMMAND CENTER / ALCATRAZ TUNNELS

			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		The British sent over their best operative, John
		Mason, to steal it.
	

MASON grabs Shepherd's machine gun, pops the clip.


			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Our agents caught MASON  
		at the Canadian border but with no microfilm.  It's never been found. 
		So Hoover held him without trial.  The British claimed they didn't know him.


			SANCHEZ  
		What about the daughter? why didn't Hoover use her as leverage?


			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		He died in 1972.  She wasn't born yet Today it's
		a different Bureau and no one wants to touch this.


			SANCHEZ  
		My god, you're not saying ...


MASON  slides the clip back in the machine gun.  Tests the action.
obviously comfortable with firearms ...



			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		John MASON  
		has been incarcerated without trial on
		American soil since 1962. He knows our most intimate secrets of

MASON, armed and dangerous for the first time in 33 long years, faces
Goodspeed.  Brings his machine gun up. GOODSPEED 
raises his -9 mil pistol in self-defense.



			GOODSPEED 
		Don't shoot me. MASON was actually slinging it over his shoulder...

			MASON  
		For christ's sake. MASON trudges down the tu=el.  Goodspeed
		follows him.

			GOODSPEED 
		Wait.  Where're you going?


			MASON  
		Off this island.  You mind?

			GOODSPEED 
		Yes I mind.  I mind very much.
	


From the tac radio in Mason's hand:

			SANCHEZ  
			(O.S.) 
			(over tac radio) 
		Goodspeed, Goodspeed, come in.



			MASON  
		You've got a phone call.


MASON  throws the tac radio at Goodspeed's feet and trudges off. GOODSPEED 
grabs the tac radio.



			GOODSPEED 
		It's me sir.

			SANCHEZ  
			(O.S.) 
		What is happening?  Where's Mason?



			GOODSPEED 
		He says he's leaving the island sir.

			SANCHEZ  
		Don't let him do that.


			GOODSPEED 
		He's got a gun, sir.

			SANCHEZ  
		What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!


GOODSPEED hurries off after Mason.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

Commander Anderson and the S.E.A.L.s lie dead, their blood running over

		Put a bullet in him.


Pvt.  Royce, appalled, can't bring himself to do it.

Cpt.  Darrow pulls his sidearm and levels it.


			HUMMEL 
		CAPTAIN, HOLSTER THAT SIDEARM.


			CAPTAIN DARROW
							(lowers sidearm) 
		Yes sir.


Royce kneels.  Feels Dandols carotid artery.

		Rodent problem, people.  Let's flush the pipes.

Pvts.  Cox and McCoy go to the drainage pipe.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL HOUSE - NIGHT 
Hummel and his men exit the

INT.  TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ - NIGHT 
Goodspeed's still trailing after
Mason.

		I don't know whatyou did or why you were sent to jail, but there are a million
		people across that bay who might die... 
			(MASON continues) 
		Fuck this. Stop.  Freeze.



MASON turns. GOODSPEED 
has his g gun trained on him.  He's not the most
convincing gun handler.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - IN FRONT OF POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Sgt.  Crisp and Capt.  Hendrix, walking toward the power plant, hear
something.  Beneath them, through a VENTILATION GRATE.  VOICES.

		Rodents located.


Hendrix and Crisp begin preparing a SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE.

INT.  TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ - NIGHT 

MASON  and GOODSPEED as before. 
MASON  advances.

			GOODSPEED 
		F.B.I. 	Stop right there.  I really mean it.



			MASON  
			(stops) 
		If you really mean it, take the safety off.


GOODSPEED fiddles with the safety catch.  With a swipe, MASON  
snatches the gun.  They glare at each other.


			SANCHEZ  
			(V.O.) 
			(over tac radio) 
		Goodspeed.  Goodspeed, come in.  Have you resolved this?


			GOODSPEED 
		Now he has all the guns, sir. .

		You've got to help me.  What do you want me to do, beg?


			MASON  
		Save your breath and your dignity, if you have any.  I am leaving.
		I am getting my daughter and getting the hell out of here.


MASON walks off.  Suddenly stops.  THE SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE has fallen at
his feet.  MASON turns, looks at Goodspeed.  And they sprint back, the
way they came.

IN THE TUNNEL BEHIND THEM - A MONSTROUS EXPLOSION blows in the tunnel
and knocks MASON  and GOODSPEED to their feet.



INT.  ALCATRAZ - SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

PVTS.  COX AND MCCOY attach a bundle of C-4 to A TANK OF GASOLINE and
toss it down the drainage pipe.


INT.  TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ

The gas bomb detonates, blowin'g a wall of flame through the tunnel. 
The fire is looking for an escape, hunting and burning everything in its
path.


DOWN THE TUNNEL - MASON  AND GOODSPEED 
see the wall of flame ROARING
toward them.  MASON  
grabs Goodspeed.



			MASON  
		Hold your breath.


They dive into a pool of stagnant water, submersing as the WALL OF FLAME
blows through the tunnel over their heads.


Mason, then Goodspeed, drags himself out of the water.


			MASON  
		Come on.  And keep your mouth shut.

MASON  hurries off, GOODSPEED on his tail.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - SUBTERRANEAN CIVIL WAR RUINS - NIGHT

The tunnel leads here, to the Civil war era dungeon.  The tunnel's
bricked up; brick and mortar circa 1855.



CIVIL WAR RUINS - NIGHT


			GOODSPEED 
		Now what?

MASON moves to the bricked-up wall.  Feels around the mortar.  Smiles. 
Removes a brick. another.  Another.  A WHOLE CLUMP of bricks falls,
revealing A HOLE.



			MASON  
		Came out right through there. (squeezes through the hole; mutters)
		'Course I've gained a few since ...



GOODSPEED follows MASON through the hole.

INT.  CIVIL WAR DUNGEON - OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL - NIGHT 

MASON  and GOODSPEED emerge to a ledge which faces A POOL OF DANK STAGNANT WATER. 
It's about 3 ft. deep.



			MASON  
		Across that, then 50 yards to the morgue. 
			(off Goodspeed's blank stare) 
		You said that's where the fucking poison is, Goodspeed.



			GOODSPEED 
		I don't get it.  You're going to help me?

			MASON  
		No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you
		think?


			GOODSPEED 
		You don't have to get all bent out of shape.


			MASON 
		What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel I was going through
		to freedom five minutes ago.



			GOODSPEED 
		All right, all right.  Don't call me idiot, okay?



MASON what did I do to deserve this?  What God did I offend .....



GOODSPEED begins to wade into the pool.

MASON  
Stop. 
(GOODSPEED stops) 
There.  And there.



GOODSPEED squints.  The water slithers with COTTONMOUTHS. MASON  
unpack the QUART OF MOTOR OIL in spray bottle.



			MASON  
		Cottonmouth snakes.  They breath through their skin.  Oil clogs
		it.  They hate the stuff.



			MASON  
		sprays the motor oil across the pool.  The snakes scatter.  The
		pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK.  MASON  
		wades in.  Goodspeed follows.



The COTTONMOUTHS, repulsed by the oil, stay away. GOODSPEED 
tries not to look at the snakes.  They make it across.



			GOODSPEED 
		Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're
		the convict, and you have all the guns.



MASON slaps the .9 MM pistol into Goodspeed's hand walks off. 
GOODSPEED follows.



INT.  ALCATRAZ - TUNNEL UNDER PRISON MORGUE - NIGHT

MASON  and GOODSPEED 
arrive at a fork in the tunnel. _

DOWN THE FORK IN THE TUNNEL - is the PRISON MONO-RAIL SYSTEM: a single
rail suspended from the tunnel ceiling, upon which SMALL CARTS are
suspended.

			GOODSPEED 
		The morgue?



MASON  nods.  Moves to a STEEL-RUNGED LADDER leading to a GARBAGE CHUTE
against the wall.  			GOODSPEED 
follows.


INT.  ROOM ADJACENT TO MORGUE - NIGHT

MASON and GOODSPEED emerge from the garbage chute.  They hear VOICES in
the next room.

INT.  MORGUE - NIGHT

PVTS.  GAMBLE and STARLING are guarding the poison. Starling's walking
around.  Gamble's seated on a MORTICIANIS TABLE, smoking.


The door bursts open.  MASON stands in the doorway.  GAMBLE dives away. 
STARLING whirls, raising his M-16.


MASON'S HAND flashes.  THE SAW-TOOTHED KNIFE flies the length of the
room and buries in Starling's neck.



			MASON  
		Never hesitate.

Gamble fires from his position around the corner.  MASON and Goodspeed
dive for cover behind a cabinet. GOODSPEED fires from cover without
looking, his gun raised over the cabinet.  Mason, underneath the
cabinet, fires at GAMBLE'S FOOT.  Gamble, shot, hits the deck.



GAMBLE unclips a GRENADE.  Before he can pull the pin....

MASON FIRES HIS CLIP EMPTY at the AIR CONDITIONER MOUNT on the ceiling
above Gamble.  The mount gives; the ENORMOUS AIR CONDITIONER falls,
crushing Gamble.  Gamble's GRENADE, still secured with the pin, rolls
away.



GOODSPEED rises.  Looks at Gamble under the air conditioner.  Just HIS
LEGS stick out. (Note: the rest of the scene's action plays out around
Gamble's legs.



			GOODSPEED 
		You didn't learn that in prison.



			MASON  
		No, and I used to be a lot quicker.



			GOODSPEED 
		I've got some questions for you but they can wait.



GOODSPEED opens the CORPSE DRAWERS revealing the V.X-. CHEM ROUNDS
(shaped like big tennis ball cans).



GOODSPEED carefully lifts out a chem round.  MASON  
grabs one, accidentally knocking it against the drawer.


			GOODSPEED 
		Careful.  The second you don't respect this, it kills you.

GOODSPEED and MASON set the V.X. chem rounds on the mortician's table. GOODSPEED 
pulls out his EQUIPMENT KIT.  Begins detaching the tops of the
chem rounds.



GOODSPEED reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out..... a
STRAND OF V.X. POISON PEARLS: ping-pong ball sized glass bubbles filled
with poison.



			GOODSPEED 
		I need a hand here. 
			(MASON looks anxiously at the poison pearls.)
 		Mason.  Now.



GOODSPEED 
hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.  MASON  holds it like a string 
of wind chimes.



			MASON  
		What...  exactly does this do to you?



			GOODSPEED 
		Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge
		at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system.
			(hands over another poison pearl strand) 
		Then loss of muscular function.
		Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled
		on the floor, then your skin turns black...



MASON stares uneasily at the pearl strands.

			MASON  
		Sounds like my first marriage.



GOODSPEED  has the chem round's GUIDANCE SYSTEMS exposed.  Inside are
tiny GUIDANCE SYSTEM MICRO-CHIPS. GOODSPEED 
plucks the chip from each chem round and pockets it.



			GOODSPEED 
			(into tac radio) 
		Pier 39 come in.



			SANCHEZ  
			(V.O.) 
			(tac radio) 
		Goodspeed?  Where the hell have you been. Talk to me.



			GOODSPEED 
		We're in the morgue.  I'm removing the rocket's guidance
		system chips.
			(to Mason) 
		Without em the rocketslll fly about 500
		feet and splash down like a wounded duck.

GOODSPEED 
moves on to the third and fourth chem rounds. Suddenly there's
a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl.  Pvt. Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is
talking to them:


			HUMMEL 
			(O.S.) 
		Gamble, Starling.  Come in.

MASON and GOODSPEED exchange a nervous look.

			HUMMEL 
			(O.S.) 
		Privates Gamble and Starling, come in.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

Hummel clicks off his walkie-talkie.  Stands there a second, thinking.



			HUMMEL 
		The morgue. Hummel and Baxter exit quickly.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT
GOODSPEED goes faster; his hands are
sweating, trembling.  It's like he's lost his spine. 
(And thinking about Carla, perhaps he has.)


			MASON  
		C'mon c'mon....  faster ....


GOODSPEED nearly drops a chem round.  MASON  
recoils.

			MASON  
		I thought you were cool under pressure.


			GOODSPEED 
		Shut up; you're making me nervous.


EXT.  ALCATRAZ - BETWEEN CELL HOUSE AND MORGUE - NIGHT

Hummel and his men race toward the morgue.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT
GOODSPEED  has dealt with eight chem
rounds.  There should be seven more, but there's not. GOODSPEED 
counts them ....


			MASON  
		They'll be on us in twenty seconds.


			GOODSPEED 
		Wait a minute.  Fuck.  Hummel stole fifteen chem rounds. 
		There's only twelve here.  Here.  Quickly.  Do these last four.


MASON raises the poison pearl strands from each of the remaining four
chem rounds. GOODSPEED quickly plucks the chips from the guidance
systems.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

Hummel and the marines converge on the morgue.  Surround the door.  They
burst inside, guns trained.


INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

COX, MCCOY, and DARROW fire machine gun bursts at --

-- MASON  AND GOODSPEED 
sprinting across floor, BULLETS chewing the
floor.  They dive into the MORGUE INCINERATOR CHUTE, GOODSPEED 
leaving the tac radio behind ....



INT.  TUNNEL UNDER MORGUE - NIGHT

GOODSPEED and MASON tumble out of the chute.  Two MONO-RAIL CARTS are
hanging there.  They exchange a look and climb into the first cart. 
MASON throws the cart's RELEASE LEVER.  The cart glides down the
mono-rail.



INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

HUMMEL goes to the mortician's table.  Sees the theft of the guidance chips.



			HUMMEL 
		Hendrix!  Take Royce and Scarpetti!



CAPTAIN HENDRIX and PVTS.  ROYCE

chute after MASON  
and Goodspeed.

Hendrix gets in THE SECOND MONO-RAIL CART.  Scarpetti gets in THE THIRD
MONO-RAIL CART.  Hendrix and Scarpetti pull the release levers.  The
Mono-rail carts rumble after GOODSPEED 
and Mason.  Hendrix shouts back to Royce:



			CAPTAIN HENDRIX 
		FOLLOW ON FOOT!


INT.  ALCATRAZ - MONO-RAIL TUNNEL - NIGHT The three carts fly down the
mono-rail: GOODSPEED and MASON  
(in CART 1) 50 feet ahead of Scarpetti
(in CART 2), who is 50 feet ahead of Hendrix (in CART 3)


IN CARTS 2 AND 3 - SCARPETTI and HENDRIX fire M-16s.

IN CART 1 - MASON  
and GOODSPEED duck as BULLETS RICOCHET around the tunnel walls.  
They pop up and return fire.


IN CART 2 - SCARPETTI arms hi over/under M-16 grenade launcher with a
grenade and...   FIRES.


THE GRENADE PROJECTILE shoots down the monorail tunnel.

IN CART 1 - MASON  AND GOODSPEED 
duck as the GRENADE PROJECTILE wings
over their heads, continues down the tunnel
and DETONATES against the tunnel wall.



CART 1 roars through smoke and debris left by grenade explosion.  As it
rounds a corner, MASON  
grabs A SPLINTERED TIMBER and releases from the
cart.  CART 1, with GOODSPEED 
alone continues down the mono-rail.



MASON  yanks down a 5 ft. long BROKEN SECTION OF SEWAGE PIPE and presses
himself against the tunnel wall.



AS CART 2 rounds the corner...

WHAM!!  MASON  swings, hitting Scarpetti flush in the forehead, killing
him and blowing him off the cart.  Cart 2, without Scarpetti, continues
down the mono-rail.



MASON  waits.  As CART 3 rounds the corner

MASON  swings again But Hendrix is waiting for it. Hendrix grabs the
swinging pipe and pulls MASON  
into Cart 3!



IN CART 3 - HENDRIX AND MASON  
FIGHT SCENE

Mason's sprawled on the floor of the cart.  Hendrix levels his M-16. 
MASON whipsaws the legs under Hendrix, bowling him over, the M-16
falling away from the cart.



MASON and Hendrix get to their feet.. They trade blow after blow as the
Cart ROARS through the tunnel.

IN CART 1 ~ GOODSPEED 
looks over his shoulder at MASON  
and Hendrix locked in mortal combat.  He pulls the CART BRAKE.  Cart 1 begins
slowing down.  CART 2 (Scarpettils) rams into it. Now Carts 1 and 2 are
together.  And on comes --

CART 3 - Hendrix knocks MASON  
to the floor of the cart.  Hendrix dives
atop Mason, strangling him. mason's head is bent over the front lip of
the cart.  MASON looks down the mono-rail track.  To his horror he sees
CARTS 1 and 2 slowing down ...

IN CART 1 - 			GOODSPEED 
realizes that his cart is going to ram Mason's
outstretched head.  He releases the brake, and Cart 1 picks up speed ...

IN CART 3 - Hendrix draws the knife.  Hendrix raises the knife.  With
his last strength, MASON rolls away.  Hendrix plunges the knife down,
missing Mason, him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the
front lip of the cart.  MASON SCREAMS at Goodspeed.

						MASON  
		BRAKE! ! !

IN CART 1 - GOODSPEED 
pulls the cart brake and --

-- CART 3 SLAMS into CARTS 1 and 2 at 20 m.p.h., crushing Hendrixls head
and torso between Carts 2 and 3.


The collision knocks MASON  
off Cart 3, SLAMMING his head against the
tunnel wall.  MASON  falls unconscious.to the tunnel floor, while --


-- CART 1 is shoved by the collision across.a DITCH OF WATER in the
tunnel floor. GOODSPEED 
groggily gets to his feet. Jumps down from the cart.


			GOODSPEED 
		Mason!

In the midst of this PVT.  ROYCE  
runs up.  Sees MASON concussed,
helpless.  Royce draws his GLINTING KNIFE.  Kneels over Mason.  He's
going to cut his throat.


			GOODSPEED 
		Wait.

Royce lowers the knife.  Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed.  The ditch
is 20 ft. wide and filled with dank, stagnant water and we've seen dank,
stagnant water before.



			GOODSPEED 
		Pretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me? 
		Punk. 
			(beat) 
		What're you waiting for?  Limp dick.

			ROYCE  
		I am going to fuck you up something fierce.  You rolled the wrong
		number, shithead.  You crapped out.

And ROYCE begins to wade into the ditch.  And GOODSPEED 
is looking at the water, waiting... ROYCE is waist deep now.  
Royce feels something. He winces.  Looks down at --



FIVE COTTONMOUTH SNAKES, fangs wide and white, plunging into him.  Royce
screams.  His knees buckle.  He falls to his knees in the water.  A
COTTONMOUTH stuck to his neck... Royce SHRIEKS again ...



And slides gently under the water.

			GOODSPEED 
		I rolled snake-eyes.  Shithead.



Goodspeed, hand over hand on the monorail, eases the cart across the 
stagnant ditch.  Hops out.  MASON gets to his feet.  The two exchange a look.



			MASON  
		Limp dick?

			GOODSPEED 
It's all I could think of.



They stumble off down the mono-rail tunnel.

			MASON  
		I think I've got arthritis.

and Goodspeed, crestfallen, listen. LARRY HENDERSON (V.O.) (loudspeaker) ...	and
they're going to	oh god... (through tears) ...	please
don't kill me



Larry's quivering voice trails off.  Replaced by:

			HUMMEL 
			(V.O.) 
			(loudspeaker)
		Convinced?  Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have
		two minutes.



GOODSPEED turns to Mason.


			GOODSPEED 
		I'll go.

			MASON  
		Wrong.

			GOODSPEED 
		What, vou?

			MASON  
		I'm not the chemical weapons expert.


			GOODSPEED 
		Good point.  Okay here, take 'em.


GOODSPEED unpockets the V.X. ROCKET'S GUIDANCE CHIPS.  Hands them to
Mason.  MASON heaves them into the bushes.



			GOODSPEED 
		What are you doing?

			MASON  
		Now they only have three rockets left.



			GOODSPEED 
		What about Mr. Henderson?



			MASON  
		Hummel's a soldier, not a murderer.



			GOODSPEED 
		Wait.

			MASON  
							(stops; turns) 
		Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men
		guarding them.



			GOODSPEED 
		I... I don't know if I can do this.



			MASON  
		There's only one way to find out.  I'll try to give you time.  And
		Goodspeed.... 
				(tosses GOODSPEED his ATROPINE SYRINGE) 
		Don't be an idiot. Put that on.



MASON moves off into the night.

			GOODSPEED 
		Well thank-you, thank-you very much.



GOODSPEED creeps toward the China Alley rocket launcher.

EXT.  CHINA ALLEY - NIGHT

structure of china Alley.  Looks up through the grate.  The ROCKET
LAUNCHER sits on the grate on the level above him.

exercise yard.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PRISON YARD - ONE MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

Darrow with his gun to Larry Henderson's head.  Hummel paces in the
background.  MASON emerges ftom the cell block.


MASON  walks up to Hummel.  The two stand there a moment, regarding each
other.


			CAPTAIN DARROW
		Gotta be kidding me.  They send an old man.


MASON gives Darrow a hard-eyed glance.  Hummel takes a lap around Mason,
sizing him up.


			HUMMEL 
		I thought I'd been in the service a long time.  Name and rank,
		sailor.



			MASON  
		John Paul Mason. 
							(stares at Hummel) 
		Royal Navy.  Commander.


			HUMMEL 
		You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.


			MASON  
		I feel strangely at home.



			HUMMEL 
 		How's that?

			MASON  
		You wouldn't believe me if I told you.


			HUMMEL 
		Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility,
		Commander Mason?



			MASON  
		Quite unique.



			HUMMEL 
		How's that?



			MASON  
		I was a guest here.

Glances all around.  Someone laughs.  Everyone laughs.

EXT.  CHINA ALLEY ROCKET LAUNCH STATION - NIGHT 

Pvt.  COX mans the
launcher.  Suddenly a voice:

			GOODSPEED 
			(V.O.) 
		Freeze. 
			(Cox freezes) 
		Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly.



Pvt.  Cox drops his weapon.  Slowly turns.  Goodspeed, one hand on his
gun, the other on HIS TOOLS, begins to unscrew the V.X. CHEM ROUND
FACE-PLATE.

ON THE GRATED LEVEL ABOVE GOODSPEED 
- PVT.  MCCOY appears. Looking down,
he sees GOODSPEED and Cox.  He cinches his REPELLING CLIP to the steel
railing.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PRISON YARD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

			HUMMEL 
		Well you're some kind of joker, Mason.  Maybe you're a lunatic. 
		Are you of sound mind, Mason?



			MASON  
		I'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people.  You
		are.



Hummells demeanor changes.  Hard now.  Tight.


			HUMMEL 
 		Give me the guidance chips.


			MASON  
		I threw them in the bay.



			HUMMEL 
		That was stupid of you.



			MASON  
			(re: hostage Henderson) 
		Would you have shot him7

CUT TO:

The marines look at Hummel, wondering the same thing. 220  EXT.  CHINA
ALLEY ROCKET LAUNCHING STATION - NIGHT GOODSPEED, still holding Cox at
bay, pulls the V.X. chem round from the rocket.  The going is slow. he
begins to lift the POISON PEARL STRANDS from the chem round.  His hand
reaches to unclip the GUIDANCE SYSTEM CHIP.


Suddenly PVT.  MCCOY repels to the level behind Goodspeed. Goodspeed
grabs the chip and dashes off, slamming through an OLD WOODEN DOOR into
the CIVIL WAR RUINS.



EXT.  PRISON YARD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

MASON and Hummel.  The previous question dangles in the air: Would you
have shot him?
		

			HUMMEL 
		You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand
		necessity.


			MASON  
		Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins."
		John Locke.


			HUMMEL 
		"Where there is no law, there is no transgression." The Bible. 
		Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.



			MASON  
		Article 7, American Constitution?  "Treason against the United
		States shall consist of... 11



			HUMMEL 
 		The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander. 
		Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and
		stupidity. 
			(beat) 
		I see little difference in my motivation.

EXT.  CHINA ALLEY ROCKET LAUNCHING STATION - NIGHT

Goodspeed, inside the Civil War ruins, levels his gun at the door.  The
chip is in his free hand.

The door CREAKS open.

EXT.  PRISON YARD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Suddenly GUNSHOTS.  Coming from China Alley.  Hummel and men whirl
around, startled.



			HUMMEL 
		Frye, Crisp, go!


EXT.  CHINA ALLY ROCKET LAUNCHING STATION - NIGHT
GOODSPEED wildly
discharges his gun until CLICK, the clip is spent.  Cox and McCoy step
through the doorway.


GOODSPEED shoves the guidance chip in his mouth.


			MCCOY 
		Swallow that and I swear on my Aunt Myrtle's grave I'll cut your
		belly open and pull it out.

McCoy and Cox spring at Goodspeed.  McCoy whips the butt end of his gun
against Goodspeed's head. GOODSPEED crumples, unconscious.  McCoy jams
his fingers in Goodspeed's mouth.

MCCOY He bit the fuckin' thing.  It's shot.


INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - CELL BLOCK 'ID" - MORNING

GOODSPEED squints through painful eyes, gaining consciousness. he looks
around, taking stock of the start cell on 'ID" block.  Gets to his feet.
 Goes to the bars:


			GOODSPEED 
		Mason. 
						(no response) 
		Mason?

			MASON  
			(V.O.) 
		It's about time.


			GOODSPEED 
		Where are you?

A CELL ON THE TIER ABOVE GOODSPEED - 

MASON  sits on a bed.

			MASON  
		Above you. 
						(under his breath)
		 Literally and figuratively.


WIDENING, we see that MASON'S MATTRESS has been ripped into long strips.
 MASON  
is BRAIDING THE STRIPS into a long rope.  The rope is quite
finely constructed.  Mason's been at this several hours.


INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS (and during the following, MASON  
keeps busy with his rope braiding).


			GOODSPEED 
		This is tiny.


			MASON  
		You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of
		your anatomy ....

			GOODSPEED 
		The cell, Mason.


			MASON  
		Five feet by seven.  Try living in one for a year.  What happened?


			GOODSPEED 
		I only got one chem round.  There are two left.  I fucked up.


			MASON  
			(sarcastic) 
		Surprise, surprise.

			GOODSPEED 
		I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.

			MASON  
		An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.


			GOODSPEED 
		What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon.  Tell me.


			MASON  
		Let's say our countries had a little dispute.  They both knowingly
		shafted me.



			GOODSPEED 
		How?


			MASON  
		Familiar with the name Hoover, Goodspeed?  I don't mean a vacuum
		cleaner ...
		


GOODSPEED listens intently and

INT.  LONG BEACH AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - MORNING


SUPER: LONG BEACH, CA. - U.S. AIR FORCE BASE.

TECHNICIANS are frantically installing WILLY PETER INCENDIARY BOMBS
under the wings of an F-16.



ACROSS THE HMGAR - General Peterson and Captain Giler brief FOUR F-16
TOP GUN PILOTS.



GENERAL PETERSON The target.  Alcatraz Island.  This is not a precision
strike.  The entire island is to be blanketed.



LWO F-16 PILOT Sir, we hit that Island with Willy Peter and it's going
to look like Iwo Jima.  No one can survive it.



GENERAL PETERSON (grimly) That's why this is a volunteer mission,
Captain.  If any of you have doubts you can carry it out, speak up.


The pilots look at each other.  Silence.

			GENERAL PETERSON 
		Captain Giler?

			CPT.  GILER 
		We jerry-rigged a release lever.  You'll find it on the left
		side of the cockpit.  It's got two positions: safety and release.  Throw
		it on release, the bomb drops in five seconds.  Change your mind, throw
		it back on safety.  Any questions?



INT.  ALCATRAZ - GOODSPEED'S CELL - MORNING

GOODSPEED stares blankly into space.  INTERCUT between the two cells
again.



			GOODSPEED 
		Jesus. 
			(thinks) 
		Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau
		where the microfilm was?  Make a trade?



			MASON  
		Some trade.  They'd get the microfilm and I'd get a bullet in the
		head.



			GOODSPEED 
		I see your point.  Something's been on my mind.  About your
		escape.



			MASON  
		What?

MASON  rises.  Lifts the bed.  Pulls off the bed's heavy ROLLING CASTER. 
Knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope.



			GOODSPEED 
		You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the
		power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe -
		that much I've got ' But... howld you get out of your cell?


MASON leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell
block.  The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length.



			GOODSPEED 
			(cont'd) 
		I only ask because, in our current situation, it
		might be useful information ...



The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the
rolling caster tied to it.  MASON  holds the other end of the rope 
through the bars of his cell.

			MASON  
		Trade secret, Billy, I'll tell you this:	it was easier than
		getting in.

MASON  
fiercely yanks the rope toward him.  The heavy rolling caster
jerks from the floor.  The CASTER, pulling the rope, flies past Mason's
cell --


-- shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block, still pulling
the rope, where --



-- the caster-pulled ROPE catches the CELL RELEASE LEVER against the
wall.  The rope coils, WRAP WRAP WHAP, around the release lever handle.



MASON  
tugs the rope taut like he's just snagged a fish. Then he pulls
slowly and delicately.



THE CELL DOOR RELEASE LEVER pulls down and --

-~ MASON'S CELL DOOR (and all the doors on that tier) open at once.  And
MASON  
smiles.



INT.  GOODSPEED'S CELL - MORNING 			
GOODSPEED hears the doors opening above
him.

			GOODSPEED 
		Hey!  Hey what's happening? 
			(no response) 
		Mason.  Mason?


Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens. GOODSPEED exits the cell.  MASON
stands there.



			MASON  
		You're on your own, kid.  Your gear's over there.



MASON  motions to a HEAP OF THEIR GEAR (clothes, weapons, flares) in the
corner of the cell tier.



			GOODSPEED 
		Shit....

GOODSPEED 
grabs his guns and gear and follows after
Mason. 225  EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel

		What happened - the injustice done

		Only one of them I care about.

		The glass is half full not half empty, sir.  No civilian

swerves madly across the bay --



INT.  PIER 39 COMMAND CENTER - MOBILE WAR ROOM - DAY

			F.B.I. RADAR TECHNICIAN 
		Second rocket's away, sir. (confused look) It
		went in the Bay sir.



INT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

Goodspeed's alone now with the last V.X. CHEM ROUND.  He -pulls out the
STRAND OF POISON PEARLS.  Suddenly an AXE BLADE comes through the door.
outside --



EXT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY -- CAPT.  FRYE chops at the door lock with
a FIRE AXE.

INT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY 
GOODSPEED  looks around frantically.  Only
one place to go. Up. GOODSPEED 
scrambles up the interior metal stairs.



EXT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE ROOFTOP - DAY

GOODSPEED 
emerges on the roof.  Sets down the chem round.  Pulls out the
POISON PEARL STRANDS, his hand shaking.  With the other hand, he unclips
the ROCKET GUIDANCE CHIP.



The COPPER STRANDS holding the pearls are corroded.  A strand BREAKS. 
Four PEARLS fall. GOODSPEED 
catches three.  The FOURTH drops, hitting
his SHOE.  It rolls along the rooftop. GOODSPEED 
sets aside the other
pearls and dives, grabbing the stray pearl an inch from the roof,s edge.



Suddenly THE HUGE LIGHTHOUSE WINDOW behind GOODSPEED 
EXPLODES, showering GOODSPEED with glass.



ON THE ADJACENT ROOFTOP ~ PVT.  MCCOY, wielding a smoking .60 Cal
MACHINE GUN.  McCoy fires a wicked, long, sustained burst, emptyinc his
entire ammunition belt.


THE LIGHTHOUSE SEARCHLIGHT FRESNEL blows to shreds.
GOODSPEED rolls away, GLASS SHARDS raining down on him, cutting him-.  
He's a sitting duck.



MCCOY casts aside the .60 Cal and unshoulders a SNIPER RIFLE.  Draws a
bead on GOODSPEED 
again.  GOODSPEED, bleeding, terrified, cowers,
awaiting death.


A SILHOUETTE APPEARES behind McCoy.  It's MASON, dirty and bloodied. 
McCoy spins.  MASON  
bats the rifle aside, KNEES McCoy in the solar
plexus, grips McCoyls NECK -- SNAP! -and HURLS him off the roof.  McCoy
falls 5 floors.



GOODSPEED gives MASON a thankful glance.  And hears THE DOOR BURST OPEN
BELOW.



INT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE ROOFTOP - DAY

FRYE roars inside.  Looks around.  Starts up the stairs.

EXT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

FRYE barges onto the roof.  Sees the DISMANTLED CHEM ROUND.  Goodspeed's
at the edge of the roof looking down.


			CAPTAIN FRYE 
		Give me the guidance chip.


Frye raises his M-16 as GOODSPEED 
jumps.  Lands hard on the ground below and sprints off.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - IN FRONT OF THE LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

GOODSPEED  sprints toward the NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING.

EXT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE ROOFTOP - DAY

Frye fires form the roof.  M-16 ROUNDS kick up dirt around Goodspeed. 
Frye curses and head back down the stairs.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - IN FRONT OF LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY Frye exits and
sprints after Goodspeed. INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY Mason
come down the stairs.  Suddenly PVT.  COX looms on the stairs below. 
Faces off with Mason.  Cox draw his knife and lunges.  MASON  
catches Cox' wrist.



Cox, with his free hand, hits Mason.  Hard.  MASON recoils.  Counter
punches.  On comes Cox.  He's huge and menacing.  He hits MASON  
again. Again.  Again.  Cox has MASON  backed up to the stairwell. -

INT.  NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY

Goodspeed, frantic, sprints across the floor, SPLASHING through puddles.
He loses his footing. falls and slides across the floor, clutching the
guidance chip an,d pear.

He gets to his feet.  LIMPS behind some RUSTY MACHINERY.

FRYE enters.  Sees RIPPLES IN PUDDLES left by Goodspeed. Frye creeps
across the floor.  Following the ripples.

INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY

Mason's nearly through.  Backed up against the railing.  Cox comes in
again.  WHAM WHAM.  MASON spits blood and teeth. MASON'S moves to
his pocket.  As Cox comes in for the death blow --



MASON  pulls the MOTOR OIL from his picket and sprays it in Cox's eyes. 
The big man is dazed, blinded.  MASON  
steps aside and rams Cox over the
railing.  Cox falls to his death on the floor below.  MASON  
looks down
at him.


MASON  
Snakes hate the stuff.


INT.  NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY

Frye creeps close to Goodspeed's hiding place. GOODSPEED 
lunges from
behind the machinery, jamming his fingers into Fryels mouth and ramming
home the POISON PEARL.


GOODSPEED HAMMERS his fist into Fryels JAW.  We hear the glass breaking
in Fryels mouth.  Fryels eyes widen.  GREY SMOKE SPEWS FROM HIS MOUTH
AND NOSTRILS.  His eyes bulge.


GOODSPEED tries to step away.  Frye bearhugs him, pressing his face
close.  Frye open his mouth, spewing forth a CLOUD OF POISON in
Goodspeed's face.


			CAPTAIN FRYE 
		You're comin, with me.


GOODSPEED shoves Frye away.  Frye drops, his body quivering.  Blood
pours form his ears and nose.  Frye spasms in a sickening dance of
death.


GOODSPEED reels away,.  COUGHING.  Dizzy, he falls to his knees.  He's
gassed and knows it.  Desperately, he rips at his PANDLEG.  A SYRINGE
taped to his calf.  ATROPINE.


He pulls it free and hesitates.  A beat, then -- He PLUNGES the long
needle into his chest.  Into his heart.  Depresses the plunger.



EXT.  SKIES OVER SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA - DAY

-- The F-169, flying north along the California.Coastline, bank right
and dive down onto San Francisco Bay.


INT.  NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY

Goodspeed's world slows down.  Is he dying?  He sees IMAGES in SLOW
MOTION He and Carla together his parents moments from his childhood...



Slowly Goodspeed's breathing normalizes.  He gazes up at the dawning
sky.  SEES something shimmering in the distance.  Through the HEAT WAVES
...



THE SOUADRON OF F-16S.



INT.  PIER 39 COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Sanchez, Director Womack, and the F.B.I. TECHNICIANS watch from the

can't.  He sinks.


ANOTHER FORM appears above him.  It's MASON, swimming for Goodspeed. 
MASON gets under his arms and pulls him up.



EXT.  ALCATRAZ - SHORELINE - DAY 

MASON drags  GOODSPEED 
ashore. 

283 INT. PIER 39 - COMMAND WAREHOUSE - DAY

Sanchez, Director Womack and the F.B.I. TECHNICIANS stare out the window
at Alcatraz, enshrouded in PLUMES OF SMOKE.



Total silence.  Only CARLA, weeping quietly in the corner.  SANCHEZ  
puts his arm around her.  Ushers her away.  Suddenly a VOICE CRACKLES:



			GOODSPEED 
							      	  (V.O.) 
		Pier 39 come in.  Pier 39  ...
			(freezes) 
		My god he's alive.



Director Womack grabs the mike.

			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
Goodspeed, this is Director Womack. Are the
hostages alive?


			GOODSPEED 
			     (V.O.) 
		Every one of em sir.

			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		What about Mason?

INT.  ALCATRAZ - CIVIL WAR RUINS - DAY

GOODSPEED stares at Mason, letting the question dangle.


			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Goodspeed.  Is Mason-alive?

A pause.  The question still dangling there.  Then:

			GOODSPEED 
			  (deep breath) 
		Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.

			SANCHEZ  
		Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.

GOODSPEED hangs up.  The two men regard each other.

			GOODSPEED 
		Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that
		pardon contract you signed?

			MASON  
		Womack ripped it up, right?

			GOODSPEED 
		You knew?  All this time?

			MASON  
		I'm not a fool, Billy.

			GOODSPEED 
		All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go
		back.

			MASON  
		Goodspeed.  You know the etymology of your name?


			GOODSPEED 
		God's speed.

			MASON  
		Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.


MASON smiles. GOODSPEED 
smiles back.  There is an immediate tacit
understanding.



			MASON  
		And if you turn around I'll tell you a secret.



Goodspeed, confused by this, gives MASON  
a look.  Slowly turns around. Camera doesn't leave him.



			MASON  
			(O.S.) 
		St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew. 
		Right leg.  Hollow.

			GOODSPEED 
		What's that? (beat) Mason?

GOODSPEED turns around.  John Paul MASON  is gone.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - DOCK - DAY
GOODSPEED is standing on the dock.  Sanchez comes down the gangplank.


			SANCHEZ  
		You surprised me, kid.  Never thought you could do it.


			GOODSPEED 
		Neither did I sir.

			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		Where's Mason?

			GOODSPEED 
		Vaporized, sir.  Blown out to sea.


			GOODSPEED 
		He saved my life, sir. Is SANCHEZ  going to accept this? .

			SANCHEZ  
		Yes 
				(smiles; acknowledges) 
		Poor son-of-a-bitch.



			F.B.I. AGENT 
		Sir, the White House calling.  It's the President.

			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		I'll take it.

WOMACK elbows past GOODSPEED 
and Sanchez.

			F.B.I. AGENT 
		Uhm, sir, actually it's for Goodspeed.


Womack glares at Goodspeed, who takes the phone.

			GOODSPEED 
		Bill Goodspeed, Mr. President.

			PRESIDENT 
			  (V.O.) 
		I am in your debt, Goodspeed, the country is in your
		debt.  You're a hero, son.

			GOODSPEED 
		Thank you, Mr. President.  The man you should be thanking is
		John Mason.

			PRESIDENT 
			(V.O.) 
		So I've been informed. Would you put the F.B.I.
		Director on please?

			GOODSPEED 
		Director Womack.

GOODSPEED hands the phone to Womack.  Womack looks at the phone.  Slowly
takes it.



			F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
		I can explain all of this, sir ...



			PRESIDENT 
			(V.O.) 
		I don't want your explanation, Womack. I want your
		resignation.


Womack grimaces.  Goodspeed, smiling to himself, turns away. CARLA 
races into his arms.  A long, warm embrace.

				 THE END
"Ronin", early, by J.D. Zeik



   










                                RONIN 

                      an original screenplay by

                              J.D. Zeik






                                             DRAFT: May 20, 1997







     A BLOOD RED SCREEN - A JAPANESE DRUM starts to play, softly,
     but tinged with a desperate edge, growing louder, joined by
     other DRUMS as a BLACK LEGEND scrolls up: In feudal Japan,
     the warrior class of Samurai were sworn to protect their
     liege lords with their lives.  Those Samurai whose liege was
     killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander
     the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits.  These
     masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai,
     they were known by another name: Such men were called Ronin.
     The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then
     the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft...

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. A MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     It's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're
     MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see
     is a medieval cathedral.  And as we continue MOVING UP
     something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.  Running thin,
     then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -
     A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs
     akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.  In one hand
     the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.  In the
     other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.
     FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame,
     silenced pistol dangling at his side.  We don't know him, and
     it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark
     his face because we'll see him again.  The Killer now picks
     up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A
     BRIEFCASE.  The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and
     turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.  The
     Killer shows them the Briefcase.

                          KILLER
               God loves me.

     THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead.
     The Killer raises his silenced pistol.

                          KILLER
                   (to his victim)
               But I don't think he's too fond of you...

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

     A PHONE RINGS, replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot
     we expected to hear.

     Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of
     streetlight.

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH AT THE END OF THE STREET

     The source of the ringing.  We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the
     phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY
     AMERICAN.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (V.O.)
               What is this?

     CUT TO:

     INT. A DRIVE BAR IN PARIS - NIGHT

     A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the
     bar in this smokey, dim dive.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
               This is not football...

     And now we're PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR.  We
     see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar, paying no
     attention to each other.  One of these men watches the game
     with real interest.  The Ugly American talks on from off
     screen.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
               ...Football is three hundred pound guys,
               they run way too fucking fast, they got
               helmets made of kevlar they use to spear
               the quarterback into the next life.

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     The phone is still ringing, louder now, and we're MOVING
     TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES, and
     even as we drink this in we're back in -

     INT. THE BAR

     AT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY, the Ugly American.  He's got
     an obvious attitude, all of it bad.  But there's something
     about the guy -- he's not all bluster, and he has the look of
     a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble.
     He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks
     solid.

                          LARRY
                   (talking to the air)
               You wanna know what football is?  It's
               hitting the other guy dirty and then
               spitting in his face when he's down.
               Football is all things American, and
               American is A-Number-One the absolute
               fucking best there is.  That's what
               football is...
                   (he points to the TV)
               ...And that's not football.

     The one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns
     slowly and gives Larry a long look.  This is VINCENT: French,
     hard boiled and solid.  Charming when he wants to be, which
     isn't all that often.  He gives Larry a long look and then
     speaks -

                          VINCENT
                   (to Larry in perfect English)
               Football -- American football -- is a
               game for faggots.

     A BEAT.  The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough
     customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but
     they're interested: what's Larry going to say?  For a moment
     it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks
     out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark.
     Vincent joins in, as do the others.  In particular - THE
     BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar
     drunk, but these guys are in a different league.  The
     Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a
     confrontation as we go back to -

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still
     ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone
     from its cradle.

                          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   (a touch Irish accent)
               Yes?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see a woman named DEIRDRE on the
     phone: striking, dark-haired, Irish.  She carries herself
     with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.
     Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end,
     and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE
     stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.  She
     gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her
     hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.

                          DEIRDRE
               Can I help you?

     The silhouette steps into a POOL OF LIGHT.  This is SAM.
     Tough, lean, enigmatic.  Somebody you might trust, but whom
     you'd never cross.  Sam returns her look before he speaks.

                          SAM
               No...

     Sam moves towards the bar, and Deirdre returns to her phone
     conversation.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm here...
                   (a beat, responding to a
                    question)
               No, it was nothing.

     INT. THE BAR - A MINUTE LATER

     Sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together
     at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all
     here for a reason.  With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR, a
     man from Eastern Europe.  His accent is hard to pin down,
     but he most definitely has one.  Gregor has the air of an ex-
     spook, and that's exactly what he is.  Lastly we see SWEDE --
     blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.  No, he's
     not stupid -- he's a sociopath.  Now - Sam looks at the
     group, which grows quiet as he enters.  Finally, Sam speaks.

                          SAM
               Sorry I'm late...

                          VINCENT
                   (a challenge)
               What makes you think we're here to meet
               you?

                          SAM
                   (meeting Vincent's gaze)
               Who else would you be?

     Vincent turns towards the others, including them in an
     expansive gesture.

                          VINCENT
               Perhaps the police?

                          SAM
               I know cops -- and you're no cop.

     Vincent smiles at Sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for
     Sam to join them.  Vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes
     them so that one sticks out, and offers it to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Cigarette?

                          SAM
               No thanks.

     Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go -

     EXT. BACK OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into
     the cradle.  Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in
     thought.  Then, without warning - Deirdre spins around,
     pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat.  The move is fast,
     performed with the grace of a professional killer, as Deridre
     scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching.  Deirdre
     pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street,
     the better to watch -

     THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her.
     PULLING BACK from Deirdre, UP INTO THE AIR and then MOVING
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. A CHEAP APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW, donw onto the street below.  Barely
     visible we can see Deirdre.  And staring at Deirdre - THE
     WATCHER.  Somebody we're going to see periodically through
     the movie.  Right now he's only a SILHOUETTE with a well-
     defined PAIR OF HANDS.  And in those hands - A KNIFE.  As the
     Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife,
     methodically, perfectly.  And he watches.  First Deirdre, and
     then turning his attention to THE BAR.  He's especially
     interested in the bar.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. THE BAR - LATER

     The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass.  When this is
     finished he looks up at -

     A TABLE IN THE BACK -

     Where our five guys have relocated.  Now the Bartender and
     Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a
     set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK
     into Vincent's hand.  The Bartender and Vincent speak in
     rapid-fire French, and then the Bartender is gone.  Sam turns
     to Vincent.

                          SAM
               He trusts you to lock up?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say he knows who I am.

     Vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them
     around the table -- again, nobody takes on.  Vincent seems
     really disappointed by this.

                          LARRY
               Anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting
               for?

                          VINCENT
                   (lighting his cigarette)
               The question isn't what we're waiting
               for... it's who.

                          LARRY
               And who the fuck is that?

                          GREGOR
               Whoever hired us.

                          SAM
               I got this gig through a contractor.
               And he most definitely didn't know who
               was doing the hiring, only that they
               were paying a lot of money...

     There's a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or
     grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men
     were hired the same way.

                          SAM
                   (continuing his thought)
               So none of us knows who's paying the
               freight, this is just some anonymous job.
               For all we know, we're working for
               different people.

                          GREGOR
               Now that is an interesting proposition.

                          SWEDE
               How so?

                          GREGOR
               Because if there's more than one party
               involved, if we really are working for
               different people, then perhaps some of us
               are on different sides.
                   (with great meaning)
               Your orders might be different from mine.

                          LARRY
               What're you talking about, man?  I don't
               understand.

                          SWEDE
                   (quietly, but loud enough to be
                    heard)
               What a surprise...

                          LARRY
               I got a surprise for you, blondie...

                          GREGOR
                   (sharply, as if he's used to
                    giving orders)
               Why don't both of you shut up?

                          LARRY & SWEDE
                   (to Gregor at the same time)
               Fuck you!

                          SAM
               Knock it off!

     There is a BEAT.  Gregor, Swede and Larry look at Sam, who
     glares them all down.  Lastly, Sam turns and looks at
     Vincent.  The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a
     kind of mutual respect.

                          SAM
               The point remains: we could be working
               for different people.  There's a chance
               for one of us...
                   (looks around the table)
               Maybe more than one of us -- has been
               paid to cross the others.  I don't know
               about you guys, but I like to know who
               I'm working for.  It can help prevent a
               great deal of...
                   (finding the right word)
               ...unpleasantness.

                          LARRY
                   (patting the gun inside his
                    cheap suit)
               Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put
               two between his eyes -- one to do the job
               and the other to make sure it takes.

     From OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound: LAUGHTER.  ANOTHER ANGLE -

     Deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last
     exchange.

                          DEIRDRE
               It's good to see you've all got such
               faith in our little undertaking.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck are you?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (staring at Larry)
               The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this
               show.

                          GREGOR
               Who are you?  IRA?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a brittle laugh)
               Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but
               there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and
               I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my
               meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the
               rest of you, and that's all any of us
               needs to know about the other.

     Deirdre hands out several thick envelopes.  Larry and Swede
     open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed
     inside.  Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his
     money.  But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look.

                          DEIRDRE
               From here on in you want something you
               pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank
               accounts are in place: ten percent up
               front, the rest when the job is done.
                   (a quick beat, then she looks
                    at Gregor)
               You.  What do you do and what should we
               call you?

                          GREGOR
               These days they they call me Gregor -- and
               I'm a tech.  I do electronic work,
               surveillance, computer runs.

     Deirdre turns to Sam.

                          SAM
               Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.

                          DEIRDRE
               You were a soldier, were you?

                          SAM
               Once.

     Deirdre gives Sam a look -- and he returns it.  Finally,
     Deirdre turns to Larry.

                          LARRY
               I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry
               from the States.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she turns to Vincent)
               And who are you?

                          VINCENT
               I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               Coordinate what?

                          VINCENT
               Things.  This is my country, you know.

     The two men exchange another look.  A pecking order is
     developing among the group: Vincent and Sam are both natural
     leaders, and now they're feeling one another out.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Vincent)
               Coordinate all you want, but make sure
               whatever you do gets cleared through me.
                   (Vincent doesn't respond for a
                    moment)
               Are we in sync on this, Vincent?

                          VINCENT
               Of course.

     Deirdre waits a BEAT, letting Vincent know what she isn't any
     more intimidated by him than he is by her.  Finally, she
     turns to Swede.

                          SWEDE
               They call me Swede.

                          LARRY
               Who's they?

                          SWEDE
               Everybody.

                          VINCENT
               And what is it you do?

                          SWEDE
               Me?
                   (with a smile)
               I kill.

     CUT TO:

     INT. A WAREHOUSE - DAY

     A PAPER TARGET, in the shape of a human being, dances in
     place as it is riddles with GUNSHOTS, each shot hitting the
     target in the belly, each shot fired by - Larry, whose been
     shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which he's just
     discharged an entire clip.  The gun is empty, Larry turns to
     Sam, who stands next in line.

                          SAM
                   (looking at the target)
               You shoot alright.

                          LARRY
               Gets the job done.

                          SAM
               All in the stomach, though.  Your man
               might live.

                          LARRY
               Not for long.

                          SAM
               Long enough to shoot back.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               It's been known to happen.

                          LARRY
                   (a challenge)
               Why don't you go do better, then...

     Without a word, Sam pops a new clip into the gun and SHOOTS
     THE LIGHTS out of several other human targets, hitting each
     target in a different place.  One he clips between the eyes,
     the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last
     target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE, firing shot after shot
     from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
     half.  Larry is impressed in spite of himself.

                          LARRY
               Yeah, well...  My way works too.

                          SAM
               My way is better.

     IN A CORNER OF THE WAREHOUSE -

     Gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and
     electronic whizmos.  Right now Gregor is holding a
     particularly high-tech type CELL PHONE in his hands, looking
     at it almost lovingly.

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Is it alright?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre sits nearby, looking at the cell
     phone.

                          GREGOR
               It's quite satifactory.

                          DEIRDRE
               Good, because it cost enough.  There's
               cheaper phones by far than that one, man:
               you better fucking use it.

                          GREGOR
                   (almost caressing the phone)
               I intend to.  This phone is wired like no
               other: it's got an encryption chip and
               instant sat-a-link recognition, it can
               talk to any computer in any language and
               make it understand.  With my custom
               hardware and this phone I can trace the
               target's cell phone signature and follow
               him anywhere he goes...

                          DEIRDRE
               You sure about this?

                          GREGOR
               I'd stake my reputation.

                          DEIRDRE
               But would you stake your life, that's the
               question...

                          GREGOR
               In this business, your life and your
               reputation are more often than not one
               and the same.

     From off screen we hear MUNCHING.  It's - Larry inhaling a
     sandwich.  A malicious look comes over Swede's face, who's
     cleaning a pistol and sitting near Larry.

                          SWEDE
               You should watch what you eat.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck died and appointed you food
               czar?

                          SWEDE
               I'm just worried about your health,
               Larry.  You could stand to shed a few
               pounds.

                          LARRY
                   (sensitive about his weight)
               And you could stand to get a little
               smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde
               fuck?

                          SWEDE
                   (sensitive about the dumb
                    blonde thing)
               Who you calling dumb, dickless?

     Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches
     for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the
     same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN
     swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping
     him to the floor.  Larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but
     it's too late: Deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then
     rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to
     the ground.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (standing above them)
               Next one of you fuckers plays this game
               I'm going to do for you myself.  I won't
               say it again: we don't have time for this
               shit!  There's a clock running on this
               job, gentlemen, and I mean to be on
               schedule.

     A TENSE MOMENT as Deirdre stares down at these tough guys --
     letting them know who's in charge.  A SOUND from OFF SCREEN
     interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent,
     who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat.

     He's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling
     men, and then at - Deirdre.  She gives Vincent a little nod --
     a silent command that makes Vincent turn to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Let's go for a ride.

     Vincent and Sam start off, moving towards the door, while Swede
     and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground.

                          SAM
               Where to?

                          VINCENT
               To see a man about a thing.

                          SAM
               I can do that.

     EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - SUNSET

     A DESOLATE URBAN LANDSCAPE - Sam and Vincent walking away
     from the warehouse, which is housed in what looks to be the
     toughest neighborhood in the city, filled with CHEAP CONCRETE
     PUBLIC HOUSING and INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.

     THE SETTING SUN throws a red glow on the street, giving the
     raw concrete buildings a blood-colored tint, as Sam and
     Vincent approach a FIAT, a car neither too old nor too new.
     Before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by
     FOUR TOUGHS, young guys in their early twenties.  The LEADER
     of the Toughs apporaches Vincent.

                          LEADER
                   (subtitled French)
               Who gave you permission to park here?

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's he saying?

                          VINCENT
               Pretty much what you'd expect.

                          SAM
                   (with a sigh)
               That's what I thought.

                          LEADER
                   (in French)
               There's a charge for parking on our
               block.

     The other Toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in French,
     of course).

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               He says this is their block.

                          SAM
               As in, they own it?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that...

                          SAM
               And I suppose he's saying that we oughta
               give them something for using it, huh?

                          VINCENT
               I didn't know that you spoke French.

                          SAM
               I don't.  But the language he's speaking
               is universal.

     ANGLE ON THE LEADER - Who's smirking at Vincent and Sam.
     Sam's words make a great deal of sense: the Leader is
     speaking the universal language of "give me some money or
     I'll kick your ass."

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I guess we oughta give them something...

     CUT BACK TO: Vincent and Sam.

                          VINCENT
               If you think we should.

     Vincent backfists the Leader in the nose -- hitting him so
     hard that the Leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then
     sits down on his ass.  This blow hurt, but the real damage is
     to the Leader's pride.  Now - One of the Toughs rushes at
     Sam, only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw
     which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him.

                          SAM
                   (as if it were an accident)
               Oh man, I am sorry about that...
                   (he sticks his hand out)
               Let me give you a hand.

     Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough, who ignores the
     hand and totters to his feet.  As soon as he's up he turns
     and runs away, followed by the other Toughs.  Now only the
     leader is left behind.  He looks for a second at Vincent and
     Sam, and then turns and runs after his friends.  Vincent
     calls after him in French, but whatever he says isn't
     translated.  Vincent turns to unlock the car.

                          SAM
               What'd you say to him?

                          VINCENT
               I asked if we could give him anything
               else.

     By now the two men are in the car, which starts up and drives
     off, as it does we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE FIAT - SAME TIME

                          VINCENT
               That was a nice move you did on our young
               friend.  Judo?

                          SAM
               Jujitsu.

                          VINCENT
               Same thing, isn't it?

                          SAM
               Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.

                          VINCENT
               What's the difference?

                          SAM
               One's a lot more painful than the other.

     Vincent laughs, and Sam looks out the window at the city of
     Paris as we MOVE THROUGH to the outside world of -

     EXT. PARIS DRIVING MONTAGE - TWILIGHT

     A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of the car driving through Paris at
     night.  We don't see familiar sights like the Eiffel Tower or
     the Arc de Triomph, but instead - We travel through the LEFT
     BANK, down a series of Mazy Alleys which twist and turn,
     filled with bistros, bars and falafel joints.  NEON SIGNS
     line the streets for as far as the eye can see.  Near the end
     of this trip we hear the SOUND OF A MATCH FLARING, followed
     by -

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Could I get one of those?

     INT. THE CAR - STILL DRIVING - SAME TIME

     Vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette.  He tosses his
     pack to Sam, but he seems a little surprised at Sam's
     request.

                          VINCENT
               Help yourself.
                   (quick beat)
               Since when do you smoke?

                          SAM
                   (lighting up)
               I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a
               week.

                          VINCENT
               A cigarette?  As in one?
                   (exasperated, almost to
                    himself)
               One cigarette a week, who smokes like
               that?

                          SAM
               I do.

                          VINCENT
               Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day,
               and I tell myself I could be worse.
                   (takes a satisfying drag)
               It's just so damned pleasurable.

                          SAM
                   (blowing a smoke ring with
                    great skill)
               It has it's moments.
                   (stubs out cigarette)
               Course, you get cancer and die, that's
               the down side.

                          VINCENT
                   (with a sigh)
               There is that.

     Vincent stamps his cigarette out, looking vaguely unhappy
     that Sam has spoiled his smoke.

                          SAM
               So, Vincent: why bring me along for the
               ride?  Job like this calls for a warm
               body, somebody who can stand around and
               look threatening.  A tough guy.

                          VINCENT
               Like Larry or Swede.

                          SAM
               Exactly.  Why not bring them?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say I thought the
               conversational possibilities were
               limited.  Of course, I might have brought
               Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right
               candidate -- for this.

                          SAM
               Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for
               sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's
               smart, Gregor is.

                          VINCENT
               So is the woman.

                          SAM
               Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously
               goddamned dangerous.

                          VINCENT
               I wonder if she truly left the IRA.

                          SAM
               I've wondered that myself.  None of this
               answers my question, though...
                   (suddenly direct)
               Why bring me?

                          VINCENT
               I wanted to see who you were.

                          SAM
               Who am I?

     Vincent, driving all the while, gives Sam a sideways glance
     before speaking.

                          VINCENT
               You were once some kind of special
               forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy
               SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for
               the CIA in some place like El Salvador or
               Afghanistan, a real mercenary.
                   (beat)
               Only now -- now you're like the rest of
               us, it's a very competitive market since
               the end of the cold war.  There's a lot
               of hired guns out here, and not nearly
               enough work to go around.

                          SAM
               That's right: there's not hardly enough
               work these days, nothing that pays the
               big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this
               job, paying so much goddamned money I
               couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's
               paying through the nose for this.

                          VINCENT
               They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're
               going to steal, it must be quite
               something.

                          SAM
               Whatever it is it must be goddamned
               priceless.

     And on that thought we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT

     The Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out.
     Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to -

     AN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a
     kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere.
     When Sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath.

                          VINCENT
               Lovely, isn't it?

                          SAM
               They'd have to keep something like this
               under lock and key in New York, and it
               would still get fucked up.

     The two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the
     public.  Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost
     invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced
     tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.  Vincent and Sam
     draw near.  This next conversation between Francois and
     Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          FRANCOIS
               That's good right where you are, Vincent.

     Vincent signals for Sam to stop.  Both Vincent and Sam are
     still several feet away from Francois.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have it?

                          FRANCOIS
               Not so fast.
                   (nods slightly to Sam)
               Who's that?

                          VINCENT
               He's company.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (as if he recognizes Sam)
               Bad company...

                          VINCENT
               What do you mean?

                          FRANCOIS
               He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's
               a cop and you better shoot him in the
               fucking head right now!

     Sam hasn't said a word -- he doesn't seem to understand
     what's been said, but he has noted the urgency with which
     Francois spoke.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT.  Neither Vincent
     nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam.  Instead they
     wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois
     said.  The conversation now switches to ENGLISH, which (it
     turns out) Francois speaks fairly well.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               I just wanted to see something.

                          SAM
                   (that edge creeping into his
                    voice)
               See what?

     Vincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing Francois
     chimes in.

                          FRANCOIS
               He wanted to see how you reacted when I
               said that you were a cop.

                          SAM
                   (he can't believe this)
               You told him I was a cop?

                          FRANCOIS
               He asked me to say it.

                          SAM
                   (looking at Vincent, truly
                    pissed)
               He asked you to?

                          VINCENT
               I needed to know.

                          SAM
               You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (to Vincent, in subtitled
                    French)
               Are you ready?

     Francois's French words give Sam pause -- he's wondering
     what's being said, as - Vincent moves towards Francois,
     leaving Sam several steps away.  The conversation is again in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH.

                          VINCENT
                   (taking out an envelope)
               Here's yours.

                          FRANCOIS
               There's been a slight problem.

                          VINCENT
                   (immediately tensing)
               What's that?

     Francois gives the slightest of nods, indicating that Vincent
     should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away -
     A COPSE OF TREES, where we see a SNIPER pointed a telescopic
     rifle at Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (still in subtitled French)
               If you say a word in English, Vincent, my
               friend with the high powered sporting
               rifle will shoot you in the throat.
               Sorry to screw you over like this, but
               the information you want might get me
               killed if I give it to you, and that's a
               price I'm not willing to pay.

                          VINCENT
                   (in French)
               I take it you still want the money...

                          FRANCOIS
                   (in English, with a grin)
               Of course.

     SAM'S POV: Looking at Vincent and Francois.

     The men are talking, and from here we can't really hear them
     speak.  All Sam can see is an earnest Vincent listening to
     Francois talk, almost as if Francois is giving Vincent
     instructions.  Now - Vincent reaches into his pocket,
     reaching for the envelope of cash he's carrying.  As he hands
     the money to Francois, Vincent uses his free hand to pull out
     his gun while - Sam already has his gun out -- somehow he
     figured out what was going on -- and now Francois looks on in
     stunned disbelief as -

     Sam fires a single shot, hitting Francois in the shoulder,
     driving him away from - Vincent, who now squeezes off several
     rapid fire shots at the sniper, while - Francois, bleeding
     but still very much alive, now has his piece free just as -
     The Sniper, his gun firing wildly into the air, falls to the
     ground, shot dead by Vincent, and now - Francois is drawing a
     bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of
     bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING
     flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground,
     spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY
     SILENCE FALLS, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
     dies.  Vincent and Sam look at one another, see that they're
     still alive, and then look back at - The two men they've
     shot.  Francois isn't quite dead.  Blood bubbles from his
     lips as Vincent leans over him.  Again, they speak in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH

                          VINCENT
               Where's my information?

                          FRANCOIS
                   (with a grim smile, pointing to
                    his head)
               In here...

                          VINCENT
               Then you better find it in your heart to
               tell me, Francois, because while your
               death is inevitable, it still isn't
               decided how painful it's going to be.

     A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francois's ear, whose grin
     blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him.  Francois
     whispers something back and then - BANG.  Vincent shoots
     Francois in the head, killing him instantly.  Then Vincent
     bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which Francois
     had tucked inside his shirt.  As Vincent does this, Sam comes
     up from behind.

                          SAM
               Now would be a good time to get the fuck
               out of here.

     INT. THE FIAT - LATER/NIGHT

     The two men drive in silence for a moment.  Vincent lights a
     cigarette and offers one to Sam, who refuses.  Finally, Sam
     speaks.

                          SAM
               You know, what you pulled back there,
               that was bullshit.

                          VINCENT
               I needed to see if you were a cop.
                   (defensively)
               I'm a popular man with the police, Sam,
               and whenever they try to catch me they
               always do it with an inside guy -- some
               man on some job who seems more
               trustworthy than all the others put
               together.  And that's the guy you have to
               watch out for.
                   (beat)
               I hate cops...

                          SAM
                   (insulted that Vincent would
                    even consider it)
               Well I ain't a cop.

     A BEAT, the two men driving in silence.

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          SAM
               Know what?

                          VINCENT
               That there was a gun pointed at me.

                          SAM
               I saw you look off when Francois nodded
               his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing
               out a particularly rare shrub, and the
               rest was easy.

                          VINCENT
               But how did you know I would have the
               presence of mind to pull my weapon
               when I did?

                          SAM
                   (as if it's obvious)
               Because that's what I would have done...

     CUT TO:

     EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER/NIGHT

     Vincent's Fiat is parked at the curb in front of this
     apartment house.  Vincent and Sam exit the car and move
     towards the house -- a silence hanging between them.  Right
     before they go into the house, Vincent takes out the envelope
     full of cash that was supposed to have been for Francois.  He
     thinks for a moment and then hands the whole envelope to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You saved my life back there in the park.
               I know this doesn't begin to make it
               right between us...

     Vincent's voice trails off -- he doesn't know what to say.
     Sam takes the money out of the envelope -- half he keeps for
     himself, the other he gives to Vincent.

                          SAM
               What I did back in the park I did because
               we're working together -- we're on the
               same team.
                   (holding up the money)
               This is business -- this is work.  We did
               it together, we share the spoils, even
               split.

     Sam opens the door to the house, but Vincent has one last
     thing to say to him.

                          VINCENT
               I owe you a heavy debt.

     Sam almost smiles cynically at this: debts of honor don't
     seem to be something he believes in.

                          SAM
               Whatever you say.

     They enter the house and the door closes behind them.  A
     second later we hear -

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               What'd you do with the money?

     INT. THE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

     Vincent and Sam sit with Deirdre in a room, alone.  They've
     told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about
     all of this.

                          VINCENT
               We kept it...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (a little annoyed)
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               Hazard pay...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with an exhalation of disgust)
               The two of you were supposed to go to a
               simple meet and come back with a simple
               piece of information, and instead you
               went to fucking war...

                          SAM
               We weren't real thrilled about it
               either...

     Deirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises.  We FOLLOW HER
     INTO -

     AN ADJOINING ROOM -

     Where Larry, Swede and Gregor are waiting.  They look up
     expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without
     stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events.

                          LARRY
               So what's the deal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (barely stopping, very
                    snappish)
               The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice
               at first light.

     And she exits, leaving these three men behind along with Sam
     and Vincent, who have entered from the other room.  larry
     looks at the two of them.

                          LARRY
               What'd you guys do?

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     A CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.  Inside sits our friend, the
     WATCHER.  Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again
     he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he
     watches the House.  It's dark -- a single light glows behind
     a window on the third floor.  Sam's room.

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to
     do a martial arts form.  Right now he's frozen, one leg
     extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg.  Now - A
     KNOCK at his door -- seconds later, it opens.  Deirdre stands
     there, watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more,
     and then retracts his leg.

                          DEIRDRE
               I feel as if I've wandered onto the set
               of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me
               to do that?

                          SAM
               I didn't think to see you again tonight.
               You were pretty pissed.

                          DEIRDRE
               I still am.

                          SAM
               Is that right?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's right.

     Deirdre spings at Sam, throwing martial arts combinations at
     him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm
     thrust.  Sam parries her blows as she drives him across the
     floor until he's got his back to the wall.  Their movements
     are controlled, but powerful, and there's something almost
     flirtatious about the whole thing.  Now -

     Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.  He slips
     behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.  The
     previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed
     exercise, but now - They spar for real -- they never hit one
     another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whizzing
     through the air, throwing rapid-fire combinations and
     techniques.  They're not angry, but they're not kidding,
     either.  Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts
     Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her
     punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted at
     all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches
     her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground
     and now - She's trapped beneath him.  The two of them are
     breathing hard from the exertion, their faces close to one
     another, shining with sweat and excitement and - We've gone
     from flirting to an almost primal seduction, and with their
     faces only inches apart Deirdre leans in to kiss Sam, and
     he's about to meet her half way when he pulls back.

                          SAM
               Part of me says I should just look at
               this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But
               then I remember you're you -- Deirdre
               who used to belong to the IRA -- and it
               occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge
               come very naturally to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (kissing him very lightly)
               Nobody's saying they don't.

                          SAM
                   (returning the kiss, just as
                    lightly)
               And when I consider that, I have to
               wonder if you don't have some ulterior
               motive for being here, with me, right
               now.

                          DEIRDRE
               I probably do.
                   (pulling him close)
               But for the time being, I'm willing to
               forget about it...

     They finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and
     as they start to make love the

     CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING, floor by floor, until
     we've reached -

     EXT. A ROOFTOP GARDEN - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre and Sam are not the only ones indulging in
     extracurricular activities.  Up here in this rooftop garden
     we find Swede and Gregor talking in hushed tones.

                          GREGOR
               I would imagine that the great
               satisfaction in all of this will be
               killing the American.

                          SWEDE
                   (we know this isn't true)
               I hadn't thought about it.  Understand
               me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in
               killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit,
               but I don't get off on it.

                          GREGOR
               A means to an end, is that it?

                          SWEDE
               That's it.

                          GREGOR
                   (he rises to leave)
               Then I guess we're set.

                          SWEDE
               There is one other thing...

                          GREGOR
               What's that?

     Suddenly Swede pulls Gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh
     THUD.  Within seconds he has his gun pressed to Gregor's
     head.

                          GREGOR
               What are you doing?

                          SWEDE
               Don't cross me...

                          GREGOR
               Nobody's going to do that!

                          SWEDE
               Really?

                          GREGOR
                   (truly frightened)
               I need you, Swede, I can't do this
               without you!

                          SWEDE
                   (beat, then he puts his gun
                    away)
               I just wanted to make sure you knew who
               you were dealing with.

                          GREGOR
               I do, I do...

     Swede is now on his feet, walking away, back into the
     apartment house.

                          SWEDE
                   (this is almost to himself)
               Just remember it, then.

     And he's gone.  And as soon as he is, we notice something
     strange about Gregor: he's not the least bit scared -- he
     laughs a little low laugh as we - 

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE HOUSE - DAWN

     GRAY LIGHT seeps in from the horizon, while inside in -

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Deirdre is pulling her dress over her head.  Sam seems to be
     sleeping in his bed as she moves like a cat towards the door
     when -

     Sam's HAND reaches out, gently yet firmly, and takes her by
     the arm.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               No goodbye?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake --
     looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance.

                          DEIRDRE
               Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way
               when I tell you we won't be doing this
               again.

                          SAM
               You don't have to explain yourself to me,
               Deirdre.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (almost surprised by this)
               I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just
               that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -
                   (almost with a sneer)
               Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with
               any man it was deemed necessary for me to
               sleep with.  You know: any man who needed
               setting up.  Sometimes so we might
               blackmail him, sometimes so he could be
               killed.
                   (a quick beat)
               Sometimes so I could kill him myself.
               IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist
               organization, Sam.  To most of the men I
               with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl
               to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of
               it."  "Have the girl fuck him."
                   (a quick beat)
               But I look at you and I get this feeling
               you take me for what I am: no more, no
               less.

                          SAM
               You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like
               me.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be
               with someone who was just like me.

     Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the
     bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam.
     They're lips brush and -

     A MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room, breaking the moment.  A
     QUICK BEAT, then -

                          DEIRDRE
               I better be getting that.

                          SAM
               Duty calls?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a trace of a sigh)
               Just business.

     Deirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens
     his door.  The muted phone is a little louder now.  Deirdre
     closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand
     and catches the door right before it snaps shut.  He watches
     THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and
     opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly
     until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting
     Sam out.  The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as
     this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go
     to - BLACK.  Just for a second.  And then - BLINDING SUN hits
     us in the eyes as we find ourselves above -

     EXT. NICE - DAY

     A DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT, establishing that we've
     changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue
     water and reflective surfaces: the Cote d'Azure.  We start to
     MOVE DOWN TOWARDS -

     EXT. A PRIVATE BEACH - NICE - MEANWHILE

     A TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays,
     sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER.
     Nearby -

     AT A ROUND TABLE -

     A nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we
     find our group: Deirdre, Sam, Vincent, Gregor, Swede, and
     Larry.  Food and drink surround them.  Larry is, of couse,
     still eating.

                          DEIRDRE
               Now then, let's run through it one more
               time, shall we?
                   (to Gregor)
               What's your job?

                          GREGOR
               I use my cell phone to get computer
               access to the telecommunications
               satellite used by our target.  I trace
               his cell phone signature and use it to
               pin point his location as he moves
               through Nice, relaying that information
               to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Larry)
               Next.

                          LARRY
                   (a sigh, he's done this too
                    many times)
               You call me with the target's route, I
               follow along until we've reached the
               attack point and then I run his squag ass
               off the road.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Swede)
               Which leads us to...

                          SWEDE
               I ride with fat-boy...

                          LARRY
                   (under his breath)
               Eat shit and die slowly...

                          SWEDE
               After we stop the target car I get out
               and use the heavy artillery to kill the
               driver and his bodyguard.

                          LARRY
               I blast the lead car into oblivion...

                          VINCENT
                   (picking up)
               While Sam and I take out the back two
               cars...

                          DEIRDRE
               Leaving...

                          SWEDE
                   (picking it up)
               ...Leaving me to step in, drop the target
               in the back seat, and get the package...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a quick look at Sam)
               While...

                          SAM
                   (returning her look)
               ...While I back him up, making sure to
               get the package if something goes wrong
               and somebody takes Swede down.

     Nobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we
     should -- if only to note that there's something about the
     way Deirdre queries Sam about his role, and something about
     the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- they're
     not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the
     history they now have between them.  But -- nobody else
     notices, and Swede's line follows Sam's without breaking the
     flow of the dialogue.

                          SWEDE
               Nobody's taking me anywhere...

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          LARRY
               Then Swede and I split with the package
               and meet you back at the rendezvous.

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          VINCENT
               And then Sam, you and I clean up
               whatever's left to be cleaned.

                          DEIRDRE
               Very good.  Now all we have to do is live
               long enough to get paid.

     EXT. A POSH HOTEL - LATER - NIGHT

     A ROW OF ROOMS, each one with a light behind a shade.  Even
     as we watch the light in each room goes off: one two three
     four five six lights -- one for each member of the team.  The
     night before the big event nobody breaks curfew.

     ACROSS THE STREET -

     A BAR -

     Through the bar window we see the Watcher's silhouette.  A
     match flares as the Watcher lights a cigarette, REVEALING his
     face for the first time: weathered, sharp, treacherous.  THE
     MATCH goes out, and the Watcher's face FADES TO BLACK, and so
     do we.

     FADE IN ON:

     EXT. THE HILLS OF NICE - MORNING

     A PRIVATE ESTATE IN THE HILLS -

     A CARAVAN OF BLACK ARMOR PLATED CARS, all idling, ready to
     pull out, filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under
     their jackets, all of them waiting for - THE TARGET.  Except
     we've seem him before and he wasn't called the Target: he was
     the Killer from the first scene of the film: the gunman in
     the cathedral who made off with -  THE BRIEFCASE.  Which the
     briefcase is still handcuffed to his side.  Now the Target
     gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in
     the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell
     phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does
     we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as
     we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and -

     THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the
     length of the town adjacent to the beach.  It's a special
     place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for
     tourists.  Here we come upon -

     AN OUTDOOR CAFE -

     Where we find Deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a
     HEADSET.  And, lest we think she looks out of place, we get
     a look at -

     THE REST OF THE CAFE -

     Where many of the other PATRONS are typing away on laptops,
     or chattering like crazy on their cell phone.  She types a
     sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out
     loud.

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright, Gregor, I'm...

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CRAMPED COMPTUER CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

                          GREGOR
                   (finishing her sentence)
               Ready when you are...

     Gregor is sitting behind a console, looking at Deirdre's
     message, which we can read on his laptop.  Gregor also has a
     much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we
     see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.  This is a map of
     incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice.
     Now - THE MAP starts to shift, randomly moving about the city
     as it searches for the proper signal.  The computer isolates
     an entire district of the city, enlarges a part of the
     district, and then locates and enlarges a single street.  Now
     - On screen a FLASHING CURSOR appears on the map, the TARGET.
     The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and
     as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR,
     driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the
     Target.  THE JAPANESE DRUMS we heard in the opening sequence
     start to play again -- softly, ominously, and we're on -

     EXT. A SIDE STREET

     Where VINCENT'S FIAT is parked at a curb, Sam and Vincent
     sitting inside.

     INT. THE FIAT

     Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him,
     loading a small arsenal of weapons.

     The DRUMS grow, a little louder now, a little more urgent.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET

     A VOLVO idles, waiting for something, Larry behind the wheel
     of this car, and sitting next to him Swede.  The DRUMS
     continue to play, and their volume is still low, but they're
     jarring, setting our nerves on edge.

     INT. THE VOLVO

                          LARRY
               Where is this broad?

                          SWEDE
               You should learn a little patience.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SWEDE
               It's consider a virtue in some corners
               of the world.

                          LARRY
               Not in mine.

     THE CAR PHONE rings, and Swede pushes a button.  Deirdre's
     Voice is heard on the speaker phone.

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               Hello gentlemen, are we ready?

     EXT. THE CAFE

     Deirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregor's instructions.
     She speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary
     business -- as if she's giving someone traffic directs
     over the phone.  The JAPANESE DRUMS continue, quiet and yet
     intense.

                          DEIRDRE
               You want to take a left, then, so that
               you're going west.

     During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play,
     building with the action as we do -

     THE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS -

     The Volvo takes a flying left turn -

     Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards
     the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his
     keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a
     bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as -
     The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does
     the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -

     THE CARAVAN of cars -

     THE TARGET CAR -

     THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE
     COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map
     shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now -

     The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build
     to a crescendo as -

     The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind
     together, as -

     CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat,
     which forces them to slam to a halt, as -

     Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS
     stop.

     Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a
     MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast
     of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing
     against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet-
     proof.  The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the
     heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.

     Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing
     away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them,
     pouring out of Cars 3 & 4.  These guys are armed and returning
     fire as -

     Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's
     got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER,
     which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as
     it scorches the air, traveling towards -

     The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized
     what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive
     back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the
     Car sideways.

     Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other
     Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a
     team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until
     it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
     one.

     And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray,
     firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's
     side so that Sam can run towards -

     The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat,
     pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death
     himself as -

     Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
     monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack
     and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a
     bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.

     Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who
     is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of
     the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires,
     winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and
     still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits
     Swede with the Briefcase.

                          THE TARGET
               Fuck you!

                          SWEDE
               Not today.

     BANG.  Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending
     his life.  Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the
     two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.  With one slashing
     blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs
     the briefcase.  The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the
     handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.  Now -
     DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back
     towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the
     briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to
     Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who
     have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the
     SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW
     MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent
     are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they
     don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire
     time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by
     any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his
     side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry
     and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks
     back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam
     screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because -
     Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the
     protective covering of his bullet proof vest.  Now we're
     MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup
     piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots
     into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way
     Larry shot the target in the warehouse.  Swede is sent flying
     backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.  For a second we
     think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just
     as Sam predicted.  Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
     too wears a bullet proof vest.  By now - Larry has rolled out
     of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now -
     Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him.

                          SWEDE
               I don't particularly like killing, tubby,
               but I want you to know that this one I'm
               going to enjoy.

                          LARRY
                   (sees something over Swede's
                    shoulder)
               I don't think so.

     Swede turns to follow Larry's gaze, and as he does - Gregor
     walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swede's chin.
     Before Swede can even compute this, Gregor pulls the trigger,
     firing straight up into Swede's brain.  Then, without even
     looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground -
     Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo, driving
     off just as - Sam arrives, kneeling down by Larry.  The SIRENS
     get louder.

                          LARRY
                   (in shock)
               He just...I don't believe that son-of-
               a...

     Vincent's Fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them,
     Vincent and Deirdre inside it as Sam manages to get Larry
     into the back seat.  Sam doesn't get in the car yet as Larry
     says -

                          LARRY
                   (still having trouble believing
                    it)
               We've been crossed...

     The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive,
     charging with automatic weapons drawn.  Between the French
     cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car,
     and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls
     it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops
     have just reached.  Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting
     off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to
     the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.  We start to SLOWLY
     PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the
     shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking
     hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street.

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE OLD CITY/NICE - SUNSET

     The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets
     in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old
     City a coppery red.

     We're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and
     turns of what an American would call back alleys but that
     pass for streets in this place.  It is quiet almost deserted,
     then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car
     through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE
     DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a
     back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.
     Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we
     PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear -

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               What is this?

     INT. A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     A SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.  Sam is tending to
     Larry's wound.  Sam seems to know what he's doing, as Larry
     is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make-
     shift stand.

                          SAM
                   (answering Larry's question)
               It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut
               with a little crank because we might need
               you awake in the real near future.

                          LARRY
               Fine with fucking me, we got work to do.
               I don't care what it takes, we are
               getting our property back and putting it
               into the hands of the people who are
               gonna pay us a great deal of money when
               we do.  I don't know about the rest of you
               guys, but I'm not the kind of guy
               to just sit back and take it in the ass.
                   (a quick beat)
               I don't mean that in, like, a literal
               way...

                          DEIRDRE
               Of course.

                          VINCENT
               Finding this package is a thing easier
               said than done.  We don't even know what
               it is.
                   (he looks at Deirdre, and
                    suddenly he's deadly earnest)
               What did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly defensive)
               I don't know.

                          VINCENT
               When this whole thing started you made it
               clear: you're running the show.  And I
               don't believe you'd be running this show
               if you didn't know what was going on.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well I don't!

                          VINCENT
               And I don't believe you...

     Vincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at Deirdre's
     head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as
     well, jammed into his stomach.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly feral) 
               You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but
               you'll be dead before I hit the ground.

                          VINCENT
                   (matching her intensity)
               I don't want you dead, woman, I want the
               the truth!

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (with a dead cool in his voice)
               Both of you...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun -
     an interesting moment, because he can shoot either Deirdre or
     Vincent, but not both at the same time.  The question is:
     whose side is he on?

                          SAM
                   (continuing without missing a
                    beat)
               ...put your guns down and chill out.

     A BEAT.  And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons,
     followed by Sam.

                          SAM
               Like it or now, we're on the same side:
               we're here and the package isn't.
                   (looks at Deirdre)
               You're not the boss any more, you're our
               partner.  So tell us what you know, so we
               can figure a way out of this mess.

     Sam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust
     based upon their physical intimacy.

                          SAM
               Now, what did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she hates to admit this)
               I don't know...
                   (defensively, off Vincent's
                    look)
               Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery
               to me just like it is to you.
                   (quick beat, then reluctantly
                    continuing)
               But I do know who we're working for.  My
               people, and the Russian mob.

                          LARRY
               Your people?  Who the fuck is your
               people?

                          VINCENT
               Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you believed me?
                   (passionately)
               But it wasn't my people who did it.

                          LARRY
               How do we know that?

                          SAM
               Because if they had she'd be gone along
               with the package, instead of sitting here
               with us.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's
               man.  It was my people came up with the
               idea for this run, but the Russians who
               had the capital to finance it.  Gregor,
               he was their insurance, and I was ours.
               Everybody else was supposed to be
               neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...

                          LARRY
               I never did trust that blonde fuck...

                          DEIRDRE
               That's why you were riding with him.

                          VINCENT
               The question still remains: what do we do
               now?

                          SAM
                   (he figures something out)
               Gregor's cell phone...

                          LARRY
                   (to himself)
               What are you gonna do, call him up and
               ask him to give us back our shit?

                          SAM
                   (ignoring Larry, to Deirdre)
               Did he bring that with him?

                          DEIRDRE
               I bought it for him -- all the stuff he
               was using, it was in his contract.  Cost
               a nice penny, too, especially that
               goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive
               tastes.

                          SAM
               Check this out.
                   (he's thinking on his feet)
               Gregor's a spook, or he was one until
               recently.  When he was a spy he lived the
               life -- you know, a prince in some
               Eastern Bloc country where nobody had
               shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the
               wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And
               Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no
               special stores with Western food and
               video tapes.  I would bet dollars against
               shit that Gregor liked that phone and he
               doesn't want to give it up.  And I
               wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant
               enough to think...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (finishing his sentence)
               That we're too stupid to trace his calls.

     Deirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles
     as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they
     might still win this one.

     EXT. AIX EN PROVENCE - TWILIGHT

     We're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France:
     the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix.

     Outdoor cafes line the sides of the street, while a canopy of
     interlocking trees covers everything.  Now we're - MOVING,
     DOWN THE STREET, towards a CAFE, where a DAPPER GENT sits,
     sipping a mineral water.  The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet.
     Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in
     neutral.  The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and
     gets up, crossing to - The Jeep.  A door opens, and the
     Dapper Gent, carrying his satchel, gets into the jeep, which
     drives off as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute, down
     the length of the Cours Mirabeau.

                          GREGOR
                   (breaking the silence)
               It's a beautiful street, no?

     The Dapper Gent also has an accent, a much thicker one than
     Gregor's; it's an accent that places the Gent as a resident
     of what used to be called the Soviet Union.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (he can't wait any longer)
               Do you have it?

                          GREGOR
               Always in a rush, you are.  All these
               years I've known you, you could never
               wait for anything.

                          DAPPER GENT
               This is important.

                          GREGOR
               Do you really think so?

                          DAPPER GENT
               You know it is.

     Gregor, still driving, takes out a SILENCED PISTOL, and the
     Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece.

                          GREGOR
               Relax!

     The Dapper Gent loweres his hand, leaving his gun in his coat.
     Gregor pulls the van to a curb.

                          GREGOR
               Look over there.

     GREGOR & THE GENT'S POV: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF
     CHILDREN are playing.

                          GREGOR (O.S.)
               Do you see that one?  The girl in the
               light blue dress?

     We find one particular LITTLE GIRL, around eight, holding the
     end of a jump rope, wearing a light blue dress.  She's
     breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his
     silenced pistol, as if to shoot her.

                          DAPPER GENT
               What are you doing, have you lost your
               mind?!?

     Gregor pulls the trigger, as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs
     his arm, and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot
     just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark, harmlessly
     shooting into a tree, causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the
     ground behind the playing children.  Nobody notices a thing.
     BEAT.  The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken, because there is no
     doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent
     hadn't ruined his aim.

                          DAPPER GENT
               Why did you do that?

                          GREGOR
               To make a point.  I don't know her, and I
               was ready to splatter her brains all over
               the sidewalk.
                   (giving the Gent a look)
               I don't particularly like you, so imagine
               what I'll do if you try anything...

     Gregor leaves his gun dangling in the air a moment longer than
     necessary and then starts the jeep as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE OF AIX - NIGHT

     A FULL MOON casts a silver light over a field of wild grass.
     A soft wind blows, and the grass moves gently from side to
     side.  Now - Gregor's JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (squirming)
               Enough!  We've been driving for an hour,
               where is my package?

     Gregor smiles -- he's been waiting for this.  He pulls the
     jeep over and looks at the Dapper Gent.

                          GREGOR
               It's under your seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (incredulous)
               What?

                          GREGOR
               As my American friend Larry would say:
               are you fucking deaf?  It's under your
               seat.

     The Dapper Gent looks down, and sure enough, the edge of the
     Briefcase sticks out beneath the seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I can't believe you'd do that, Gregor.  I
               thought I trained you better than that.

     With a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor,
     whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward.
     He can't help himself, he opens the satchel and there it is -
     COLD HARD CASH in large bills, enough for Gregor to live like
     a prince for quite some time.  Gregor sucks in an involuntary
     breath and then looks back up to see - The Dapper Gent hasn't
     reached for the Briefcase.  Instead he's taken out his gun,
     and it's only inches from Gregor's head.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I've never particularly liked you either,
               Gregor.

     The Dapper Gent yanks out the Briefcase, and as he does -

     THE SEVERED HAND comes whipping out along with it, still
     attached by the handcuff chain.  The Hand flies up in the
     Dapper Gent's face, and we notice that the Hand is starting
     to rot -- it's bloated and swelling and horrific and it
     scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent, who drops his gun and
     fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFT...we hear the sound
     of another silenced shot as we -

     SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     A DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of
     the jeep.  Seconds later - The door swings open, and the
     Dapper Gent's body plunks out onto the ground.  A moment
     later, something wet and viscous plops down on the face of
     the Gent as the jeep drives off.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT on
     the Dapper Gent's dead body, which lies in the silver
     moonlight, blood running out from beneath him, while the
     Severed Hand palms the Gent's face, fingers splayed out
     around his head.  Now - We HEAR the sound of PHONE TONES.
     And not just any phone...

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor finishes punching a number into his CELL PHONE.  We
     hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is
     picked up.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Is it done?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               It's done.

     BEAT.  The Phone Voice doesn't respond for a moment -- whoever
     this is they didn't expect to hear from Gregor.  The Voice
     switches to English.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               Gregor, is that you?

                          GREGOR
                   (with a low chuckle)
               Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               It was a mistake, it shouldn't have
               happened.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly cold, furious)
               I'm in the middle of saving you people a
               great deal of money -- the least you
               could do is have the decency to pay me!

     BEAT.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               So what do we do?

                          GREGOR
               What I do is none of your concern.  What
               you should do is wait for my next phone
               call.  I'm going to find a place where I
               can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm
               ready, I'll call you and tell you what I
               want you to do.

     The Phone Voice says something unintelligible in Russian, cut
     off by Gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE CHEAP APARTMENT - DAWN

     Larry snores on the couch, while Deirdre sleeps in a sleeping
     bag on the floor.  Vincent sits in a ratty easy chair, feet
     propped on an overturned crate, dozing lightly.  Suddenly -
     Vincent's eyes open, warily, as if something has changed in
     the room.  He looks around - No Sam.  Vincent gets up, takes
     out his gun, and silently gets to his feet.  He moves down a
     long hall and - No Sam.  Now, like a cat, Vincent moves into -

     THE BATHROOM: pitch black.  He moves in, swipes the string of
     the overhead light and - nothing.  Nobody's here.  The only
     place left is the front door, and now Vincent approaches.  He
     opens the door, gun still at ready, and moves out into -

     INT. THE LANDING OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     This is a small building.  There is no other apartment on
     the floor.  At the far end of the landing, there is a small
     ladder which leads up to -

     THE ROOF.  And the door which leads to the roof is flapping
     in a light wind.

     EXT. THE ROOF - SAME TIME

     Vincent bursts onto the roof, gun straight out, finger on the
     trigger, only to find - Sam is there, his gun pointed at
     Vincent.  A BEAT, then both men give little laughs and put
     their weapons away, like Samurai so trained in combat that
     they know when it's safe to relax.

                          SAM
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               You weren't around when I woke up, I
               thought maybe something had happened.
                   (off Sam's look)
               This has been one very fucked up job,
               Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances
               on anybody...
                   (a quick beat)
               Including you...

     In answer Sam takes out Vincent's pack of cigarettes and
     tosses them back to him.  Vincent looks almost delighted at
     this.

                          SAM
               I came up here to sneak a smoke.

                          VINCENT
               You were smoking?

                          SAM
               I hope you don't mind I took your pack.
               It was on the table.

                          VINCENT
                   (very sincere, offering the
                    pack)
               Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many
               you'd like.

     Sam considers for a minute, and then takes one.  Vincent does
     so as well, and he searches for his lighter, which he can't
     seem to find, because - Sam has it, and he lights their
     cigarettes, and then hands the lighter back to Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (a shrug of the shoulders)
               I borrowed that, too...

                          VINCENT
                   (puffing contentedly)
               Of course...whenever you feel like it
               just help yourself.

                          SAM
               I have a feeling I'm about to start
               buying my own.

     BEAT.  The two men smoke in silence, looking out at -

     THE CURVED SHORELINE OF NICE -

     Which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment
     buildings, and a thousand more from the cars that travel on
     the road that leads into town: the Promenade des Anglais.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               That was a bad bit of business, today.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
               It was at that.

                          VINCENT
               A lot of people died.

                          SAM
               I've seen a lot of people die before.

                          VINCENT
               I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you
               get used to it?

                          SAM
               You don't.  You just learn to live with
               it.

                          VINCENT
               I won't lie -- there have been times when
               I had to do it, times when the only way
               to get out alive was to see that the
               other man didn't.

                          SAM
               We live in a singular world, my friend.

                          VINCENT
               I never really thought I was part of the
               world you move in, Sam, to tell you the
               truth.
                   (off his look)
               I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small
               time king of way.  To the local police
               I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a
               legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just
               another two bit hired gun.

                          SAM
               You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I
               got a feeling you cost more than two
               bits.

     This conversation might have gone further, but it is
     interrupted when Deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof.

                          DEIRDRE
               Christ, I was starting to think that the
               two of you had thrown it in and walked
               away.
                   (to Vincent)
               There's someone on the phone downstairs
               asking for you, and my somewhat limited
               French leads me to believe that he might
               have something to tell us about Gregor.

     EXT. THE HIGHWAY - LATER - NIGHT

     A car we haven't seen before, a CITROEN, hums up the French
     highway in the night, along on the road.  It's a postcard
     moment, but only for a moment.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               I'm telling you...

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

                          LARRY
                   (continuing)
               That I could be dead and I'd drive better
               than you.

     Deirdre is driving, and Larry -- much to his chagrin -- is in
     the passenger seat, watching her every move.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (very curt)
               Oh shut up...

     IN THE BACK SEAT -

     Sam and Vincent have a MAP spread out.  Vincent is tracing
     Gregor's route so far, and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as
     it traces a line up the highway.

                          VINCENT
               He's going north.
                   (circles something on map)
               That's Aix en Provence, where he used the
               phone.

     Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the
     map.  Destination: Paris.

                          SAM
                   (making up his mind)
               He's going back.

                          VINCENT
               Not necessarily.  He could go off road at
               any number of places.  He might not even
               be in the country anymore.

                          SAM
               It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for
               anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he
               doesn't waste time on this road unless he
               has to be on it in the first place.
               Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by
               now.  He's going to Paris.
                   (beat)
               Now I just hope we can find him before he
               gets there.

                          DEIRDRE
               If somebody else doesn't find him first.

     EXT. THE TOWN OF ORANGE - DAY

     Orange, pronounced "Au-Ronge", is a mid-sized town of fifty
     thousand souls.  It is small, charming, quaint, and it has
     one particular thing that no other town in France can claim -

     AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly
     restored.  We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we
     MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE.
     It's packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled
     with a tourist having breakfast.  This normally quiet place
     explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally
     famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater.  We come
     upon -

     A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS: a Family.  Dad is angry at Mom.

                          DAD
               Opera?  This is an opera festival?

                          MOM
               I told you that, Henry.

                          DAD
               I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera.
               You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that
               kind of thing.

     Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them
     behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a
     cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.  Here, in the most
     removed table in the entire Square, we find Gregor sitting in
     the shadow of the trellis.  Unless you're on top of him you
     can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly.  His cell
     phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and
     starts to punch in a number.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A REST STOP ON THE HIGHWAY - MEANWHILE

     THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars.  Sam is
     sleeping in the back seat, while Vincent is seen on an
     outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot.
     Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating French
     fast food, which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH
     OF THE TABLE, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages
     with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes.

     In fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the
     imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry
     can't contain himself.  He's stuffing himself, washing
     everything down with the wine which is also sold at these
     road-side rest stops.  Deirdre drinks coffee.

                          LARRY
                   (mouth full)
               This...this is incredible. Is the rest
               of Europe like this?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a laugh)
               Some places, not all.  Italy, for
               instance, they're serious about their
               food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere
               in the U.K., you don't get much fancier
               than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not
               our thing, you see.

                          LARRY
               What is?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (everybody knows this)
               Best beer in the world known to man or
               God.

                          LARRY
                   (with a snort)
               Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for
               me, thanks.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with unconcealed scorn)
               Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and
               you've the unbridled gall to mention
               Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's
               not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor
               excuse for rabbit piss.

                          LARRY
               Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?

                          DEIRDRE
               I drink what every civilized man, woman
               and child in the world drinks: Guinness.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               I hate to interrupt a conversation of
               such cultural depth...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent -

     Who has finished his phone call and returned to join them.

                          VINCENT
               ...but we've got to get back on the road.

     Vincent raps lightly on the car window next to Sam's head --
     Sam's eyes shoot open: a light sleeper.  All eyes are on
     Vincent, who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news.

                          VINCENT
               We've got him.

                          LARRY
               I'm driving.

     EXT. THE TOWN SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Gregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table
     in the corner cafe.  He's been here for hours, observing the
     Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking
     for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music,
     have entered the Square -- everything about these guys
     screams GUNMEN.  Now, as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN
     comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope.  The
     Gunmen look around the Square, trying to see where Gregor is,
     but he's too far back in the shadows.  The Gunmen ask the
     Teen a question, to which the Teen can only shrug his
     shoulders.  Now - The Teen walks away, leaving the Gunmen to
     open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly
     read.  From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching
     in a number on his cell phone.  Simultaneously, the Gunmen
     finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them, and
     turn around to face - A PAY PHONE.  The phone rings, and one
     of the Gunmen goes to pick it up.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - MEANWHILE

     The Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl, cruising
     the streets, looking for Gregor.

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

     Vincent stares out of the window and sees something that
     causes him to swear under his breath in French.  It's -

     The Gunmen walking down the street.

                          VINCENT
               I know those men.

     Sam frowns: he also seems to recognize at least one of the
     gunmen.  None of the others in the car notice Sam's reaction,
     but we do.  The Gunmen are heading straight for -

     EXT. THE ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman
     Theater.  The theater itself is almost two thousand year
     old.  A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a
     massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its
     kind in the world.  THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the
     theater, holding ticket stubs.  They are with a Tour Group
     led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French.  As
     the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall, the Gunmen hang
     back and then separate from the crowd.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - SAME TIME

     THE CITROEN sits at a curb.  Larry sits behind the wheel of
     the car, the getaway driver with the motor running.  Vincent
     and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater.  Sam
     stays behind for a second to say something to Larry.

                          SAM
               Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when
               your partners come back out, you make
               sure you're here with the motor running.

     And on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre.
     Larry doesn't notice it, but - THE WATCHER has found them.
     He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard
     and hugging the shadows of back alley.  Cradled in one hand,
     barely visible but ominously present: his knife, which for
     one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. INSIDE THE ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     The Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum-
     like staircase.  Behind them we can see the Tour Group,
     standing on the stage, being lectured to by the Ancient
     Geezer.  In front of them the Gunmen find -

     AN EXIT which leads to an interior hall.  Inside the exit
     it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen.  They
     look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice
     come at them from out of the dark.

                          GREGOR (V.O.)
               Thank you, gentleman, that will do
               nicely.

     IN THE HALL -

     ON GREGOR.  It's dark in here.  There are no lights, no
     torches.  From the dark in here, he can look out and see -
     THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by
     the sun.  Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES,
     and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can
     see his quarry, but they can't see him.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard, is that you?

     EDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen
     responds.

                          EDVARD
               Yes, Gregor, they sent me.

                          GREGOR
               I'm touched, really, that they'd send
               someone of your caliber.  It's nice to
               know that they didn't make the mistake of
               underestimating me twice.

                          EDVARD
               That was a mistake, trying to kill you.
               Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd
               have never allowed it.

                          GREGOR
               I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's
               too late for trust: we have a serious
               problem.

                               EDVARD
               We'll double your price.

                          GREGOR
                   (now that's interesting)
               Really?  Do you have the money with you?

                          EDVARD
               Do you have the material?

                          GREGOR
               You first, Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Perhaps we could both go at the same
               time...

                          GREGOR
                   (a short laugh)
               I think not.
                   (with a flourish)
               After you...

     A GUN COMES INTO FRAME, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to
     Gregor's temple.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               After you, asshole.

     Gregor stiffens, as we PULL BACK ON Sam, who has snuck up on
     Gregor and gotten the drop on him.

                          SAM
               You might have been one mean technical
               spook, Gregor, but you wouldn't have
               lasted a week in the field.

     CUT TO THE GUNMEN'S POV: Looking into the Tunnel - It's dark,
     they can't see a thing, but they've heard Sam's voice and
     they know something's wrong.

                          EDVARD
               Gregor, are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Gregor's fine...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Deirdre -

     She's snuck up on the Gunmen, weapon drawn.

                          DEIDRE
                   (continuing)
               ...but I think you're in a bit of
               trouble.

     The Gunmen reach for their pieces and as they do -

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Don't even think it.

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent - And his piece is also out --
     the Gunmen are trapped, and they know it.  Now we notice that
     - The Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards
     us.  Meanwhile, back in -

     THE TUNNEL -

     Sam is grilling Gregor furiously, his gun still to Gregor's
     head.

                          SAM
               Don't talk to me unless you tell me what
               I want to hear, understand?!?  You have
               no choice in this, don't think about
               winning, think about staying alive.  I
               want the item, and if you don't give it
               to me, I'm gonna kill you.

                          GREGOR
                   (a panicky hiss)
               I don't have it with me...

                          SAM
               Bullshit!

                          GREGOR
               I swear...

                          SAM
               Then where is it?

                          GREGOR
               I sent it to myself in Paris.

                          SAM
               Sent it where?

                          GREGOR
               A post office box.

     Suddenly Gregor runs forward, towards the exit.  Sam runs
     after him, tackling him just as they reach - THE OUTSIDE,
     where the two men roll into plain sight of - The Gunmen, who
     are still covered by Vincent and Deirdre.  Now we notice -
     That the Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are really close,
     no more than ten yards away, as - Sam has Gregor pinned face
     first on the ancient stone of the theater.  He looks up at
     the others, and that's when it happens - Edvard looks at Sam
     and recognizes him.

                          EDVARD
                   (stunned, announcing to the
                    group)
               Do you know who he is?  He's with
               Interpol, the Internation Police.  He's
               a cop.

     A SLOW MOTION BEAT.

     Vincent and Deirdre don't know what to make of this, their
     heads turn to look at Sam, and in this instant - The Tour
     Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for
     his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman, and with
     the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME, as -
     The Crowd panics, screaming, and now Edvard is reaching for
     his weapon, as - Sam shoots again, killing the 2nd Gunman,
     and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as -
     Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as -

     Deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into
     the tunnel.  Now we go -

     OUTSIDE THE THEATER -

     Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn, but
     he's been ordered to stay in the car.  In frustration he
     slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry,
     the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as
     we go back -

     INTO THE THEATER -

     Edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many
     Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of
     them, including the Dad we saw earlier.  Seconds later,
     Edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now - Vincent and
     Sam meet in the middle of the crowd.  There is time for a
     QUICK BEAT, while Vincent glares at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I
               should kill you.

                          SAM
               But you can't.

     And now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving
     Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow
     Sam into -

     THE TUNNELS -

     It's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena.
     Except that everything here is made of stone and the only
     light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit
     openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide
     just barely enough light for us to see.  Now we do a SERIES
     OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while -
     Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a
     dead end.  He turns around, looking for a way out as - Gregor
     sees the final exit ahead of him as we go -

     OUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the
     Citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that -
     The Watches is almost on him, and now we're back -

     IN THE TUNNELS -

     Deirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost
     reached the exit as -

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     Gregor hits the street running.  He doesn't notice the
     Citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but
     as he runs by -

     The car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it.
     He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured.
     Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in.  It's the
     Watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one:
     SEAMUS REILLY.  Seated in the front seat is - A very dead
     Larry.  Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Gregor, with an Irish
                    accent)
               If you want to live you'll do exactly as
               I tell you.

     THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears, exiting the
     theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to -

     INT. THE TUNNELS - SAME TIME

     Vincent, gun drawn, moves warily down one of the tunnels.
     Outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren.
     Vincent turns a corner and - A GUN jams itself into his face.
     It's Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Where do I know you from?

                          VINCENT
               Vienna.

                          EDVARD
               Of course...I remember.  I quite liked
               you, I'm sorry to have to do this.

     Edvard's finger tightens around the trigger, when -

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Hey...

     Edvard is startled by the sound of Sam's voice.  Even as he
     squeezes off the shot, Edvard turns to look at Sam, and as he
     does so, Vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot
     awry, causing it to - RICOCHET wildly, whining around the
     room, until it - Rips through Sam's side, a nasty wound but
     not fatal, as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but it's
     too late, because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head
     that kills Edvard.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre has reached the Citroen.  She looks in and sees
     Seamus and Gregor.  Lastly she looks at the dead Larry.  She
     sighs in disgust, but otherwise doesn't react as if
     surprised.

                          DEIRDRE
               Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch
               would have sufficed, Seamus, don't you
               think?

     SCANT SECOND LATER -

     Larry's body hits the street as the Citroen drives off,
     Deirdre behind the wheel just as - Sam and Vincent run out of
     the theater, with Vincent helping a wounded Sam who bleeds
     from the wound in his side.  They arrive at the street only
     to see - Larry, lying dead in the street, even as the Citroen
     speeds away from them, turning the corner before they can
     even think to raise their guns.

                          VINCENT
               That double-crossing bitch.

     Sam isn't even capable of saying that much -- he just stares
     after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any
     we've seen in the film: "how the hell did that happen?"  But
     there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by
     - A COP.  He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts
     drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless,
     holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he
     stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're
     both pointed at the Cop.  LONG BEAT.  In the way off distance,
     another siren can just be heard.  Sam and Vincent glare at
     the Cop, who strains with all his might to control himself,
     but he can't because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be
     served.  The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his
     mind.  Two.  One.  The Cop puts his gun on the ground and
     steps back, raising his hands in the air.  Now - Sam and
     Vincent stumble into the street, and are instantly almost hit
     by - A CAR speeding around the corner, its Driver oblivious
     to what's going on.  The car screeches to a halt, and the
     Driver curses loudly in French.  And then the next thing the
     Driver knows - A Gun is in his face.  The door is yanked open
     and the Driver is yanked out, as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK ROAD - LATER/EARLY EVENING

     The town of Orange is just visible below us as the
     commandeered Car drives up into the hills.  Vincent is behind
     the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat.
     Gritting his teeth, Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at
     - THE WOUND, and it's small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a
     small raw hole in Sam's side.  The wound bleeds, but
     moderately so -- no major organs or arteries have been hit.

                          VINCENT
               That makes twice now you've saved my
               life.

                          SAM
               I didn't save your life back there.
               Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save
               shit.

                          VINCENT
               You see it your way, I'll see it mine.
               You need a doctor.

                          SAM
                   (hopeful)
               You know one around here?  Somebody you
               trust?

                          VINCENT
               No...I thought I'd take you to the
               hospital.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I
               have to.

                          VINCENT
                   (he can't believe this)
               Fix it yourself?
                   (a thought comes to him)
               Why are we even doing this?  There's no
               need to run, Christ...
                   (he can't disguise his disgust)
               You're a cop.

                          SAM
               Not exactly.

                          VINCENT
               You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.

                          SAM
               If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have
               busted you a long time ago.  This isn't
               about you, it's about the job I have to
               do.

                          VINCENT
               And what job is that?

                          SAM
               My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to
               know about.  I can't go to the local cops
               -- they'd never be able to get close
               enough at this point.  It's me or nobody,
               and I've been on this job too goddamned
               long not to finish.

     BEAT.  Sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes, offers one
     to Vincent and takes another for himself.  They smoke for a
     second, before Vincent speaks.

                          VINCENT
               It looks to me like we're all that's left
               of our group.

                          SAM
               We?  There is no we in my world now,
               Vincent, just me.

                          VINCENT
               I'm going with you.

                          SAM
               This doesn't involve you, don't you
               understand?  I can't even guarantee you
               any money out of all this.

                          VINCENT
               It isn't about money for me, not
               anymore.

                          SAM
               You don't have to do this.

                          VINCENT
                   (with great finality)
               Yes I do.

     Sam gives Vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief --
     Vincent's loyalty and sense of honor is something he's never
     seen before, and Sam can only smoke in silence and consider
     this as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CHEAP BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A PEEPHOLE slides open, and we look through it into -

     INT. AN ADJOINING ROOM

     where Gregor sits, bound and gagged in a chair, his eyes wide
     with fright.  Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre
     turns to face Seamus Reilly.

                          DEIRDRE
               When we're done with this, I want to do
               for that one myself.

                          SEAMUS
               Now there's the Deirdre I know.

                          DEIRDRE
               And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus
               Reilly?

                          SEAMUS
               It means I was worried that all the time
               you spent away from the fold might have
               affected you.  You've been living the
               life of the hired gun -- the well paid
               hired gun, I might note.  There's no
               glory to it, but there are those that
               like it.

                          DEIRDRE
               So you thought that maybe I'd grown too
               attached to this charade I've been
               playing, is that it?

                          SEAMUS
               It's been known to happen.

                          DEIRDRE
               Not to me, you know that.

                          SEAMUS
                   (goading her)
               I thought I did.

     Seamus's taunt works: Deirdre whips out her gun and puts it
     to his head.

                          DEIRDRE
               I guess you don't know me, then, if you
               think I won't kill you for an insult like
               that!

     Seamus glares at Deirdre for a moment, and she glares back at
     him until he starts to laugh.

                          SEAMUS
               Just testing, lass.  Forgive me, but I
               had to do it.

     Deirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun.

                          DEIRDRE
               Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when
               we get home, I don't play "the girl"
               again.

     Deirdre gives Seamus a look to make sure this last point is
     clear and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A FARMHOUSE - THE COUNTRY - NIGHT

     The Stolen Car parks behind a BARN, and Sam and Vincent get
     out.  Waiting for them is a friend of Vincent's - JEAN-
     PIERRE, a Frenchman in his forties, hearty, burly, friendly.

                          VINCENT
               Hello, Jean-Pierre.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Hello, my friend.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

                          SAM
               American.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we
               see what we can do for you?

     INT. THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - LATER/NIGHT

     SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS - Are laid out on a clean cloth.
     Scalpel, forceps, a clamp, a sponge, medical thread and
     needles.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Sam, stretched out on the
     kitchen table.  Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre,
     who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sam's wound.
     Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see what's
     going on.  Sam, with his medical training, is treating
     himself.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               It's right there, beneath the surface.  I
               can just make it out.

     Sam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus
     on what's going on so that he can talk Vincent through this
     next procedure.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Are you sure you won't have a drink?

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the
               mind I can control.
                   (quick beat)
               Alright, let's do it.

     During this next sequence, we CUT BACK AND FORTH between
     Sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where
     he's watching.

                          SAM
               Douse the wound with alcohol.

     Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the
     wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his
     central nervous system.

                          SAM
                   (to Jean-Pierre)
               Take that sponge and wipe away as much of
               the blood as you can, keep it clean so I
               can see.

     Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that
     keeps filling the wound.  Throughout the procedure Jean-
     Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he
     squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the
     floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               Take the clamp...

     Vincent picks up the clamp.

                          SAM
               Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.

     Vincent attaches the clamp to Sam's wound.  It takes perhaps
     fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing
     for Sam.  He sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the
     smallest of grunts.  But he doesn't move.  Finally Vincent is
     done.

                          VINCENT
               Alright, it's done.

                          SAM
               You see the bullet?

                          VINCENT
               Clearly.

                          SAM
               Good.  Now take the forceps, and
               remember, Vincent, what we're doing here
               is routine.  I've done stuff like this at
               least twenty times in the field.  There
               are no vital organs where you're working,
               no major muscles or arteries -- you can't
               kill me.  Just make sure you've got the
               bullet before you try to pull it out.

     Vincent probes the wound with the forceps.  This takes
     probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the
     clamp was attached.

     Several times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his
     grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips - Sam makes the
     smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain.
     Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a
     single tug, Vincent extracts it.

                          VINCENT
                   (holding the bullet aloft)
               A souvenir...

     He tosses the bullet through the air, and we FOLLOW IT IN
     SLOW MOTION as it lands in - A SAUCER, which sits on the
     kitchen counter.  We're back in REAL TIME, as the bullet
     rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt.
     Now - Sam breathes the hugest of sighs, and his face relaxes.
     Instantly, Vincent puts a lighted cigarette in Sam's mouth,
     and he drags deeply on it.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               You think you can stitch me up on you
               own?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

                          SAM
               Then if you don't mind...
                   (he hands the cigarette back to
                    Vincent)
               I'm gonna pass out.

     And that's exactly what he does.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Vincent and Jean-Pierre sit on easy chairs.  An open bottle
     of wine sits between them, a FIRE burns in the fireplace, and
     they smoke in a contented silence for a moment.  When they
     speak, it is in FRENCH, with ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               He's tough, your American friend.

                          VINCENT
               Yes, Sam's tough alright.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               And you respect him.

                          VINCENT
               Of course.  Don't you?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I've never seen a man who could have
               taken what he just went through.
                   (beat)
               He's a cop?

                          VINCENT
                   (beat, trying to find a way to
                    say it)
               Not exactly.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?
                   (beat)
               So he saved your life, then?

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in
               his head a long time ago.

     Both men stare back into the fireplace and we HOLD FOR A BEAT
     before we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THE FARM - KITCHEN - DAWN

     Sam is awake.  Pale from the loss of blood, he moves softly
     around the kitchen, searching professionally for something,
     giving the moment a slightly dangerous feel because he seems
     so intent on what he's doing and then he finds it - THE
     COFFEE.

     TEN MINUTES LATER -

     A stream of Hot Coffee migles with a stream of Steamed Milk.

     EXT. THE FARMHOUSE PORCH - SUNRISE

     A STEAMING CUT OF COFFEE sits in Sam's hands as he lights a
     cigarette to go with the coffee.  He sits on an ancient
     chair, smoking in silence, looking out at - THE WOODS around
     the house, and this place is postcard-beautiful, the French
     Farmhouse you see only in pictures.  But Sam's mind is
     elsewhere, he's staring into space, lost in thought.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               You're feeling better?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Jean-Pierre stands in the open front door of
     the farmhouse, with a cup of coffee.  Now, Jean-Pierre moves
     out to join Sam, sitting down on another chair opposite him.

                          SAM
                   (responding to the question)
               Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for
               now.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
                   (pointing at Sam's wounded
                    side)
               You should really let a doctor look at
               that.

                          SAM
               Soon.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               But first you have something to take care
               of?

                          SAM
               Yeah.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Something important?  A thing that cannot
               wait?

                          SAM
               It gets done now or not at all.  Another
               couple of days and the parties concerned are
               gone where I can't get them.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Forgive my intrusion into your affairs,
               but I am the one who connected Vincent to
               this job, his agent, if you will.  He is
               one of my oldest friends and I owe him a
               great debt, much like the debt I suspect
               he owes you.

     A QUICK CUT TO:

     INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

     Where Vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit
     a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from
     outside.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Vincent doesn't owe me a thing.

     Vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards
     the sound of the voices.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               He sees this differently, as you well
               know.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I didn't expect that he would.

     BACK ON THE PORCH -

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You suffered through an agonizing pain
               last night, pain you could have avoided
               by declaring yourself an agent of the
               law.

                          SAM
               Vincent told you that I'm a cop?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal
               would have the extensive military and
               medical expertise you do.  And so I place
               the pieces of the puzzle together in a
               way that makes sense to me.  You work for
               some government agency and you carry a
               gun, and in my world, that makes you a
               cop.

     And now Jean-Pierre produces a LONG BARRELED REVOLVER which
     he places loosely in his lap -- a gesture which seems to say,
     "you'd better explain things to my satifaction or we're
     gonna have a problem."  Sam notices the weapon, but he
     doesn't react overtly.

                          SAM
               So this is what, a test?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Call it a reckoning of character.

     BEAT.  Sam looks at the Revolver again.

                          SAM
               If I was healthy, I could take that away
               from you.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if
               you try I'll kill you.

     QUICK CUT TO: Vincent - Who stands inside the house, out of
     sight, but not out of ear shot.  He's listening to
     everything, and we notice that Vincent has taken out his
     own gun.

     BACK ON Jean-Pierre and Sam.  By now Jean-Pierre has raised
     the pistol.  He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks
     the hammer.

                          SAM
               So what is it you want to know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I suppose I want to know how a man like
               you is created.

                          SAM
               Created?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like
               steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern
               Samurai.  I've spent my life around
               extraordinary men -- men like Vincent.
               But I've never seen anyone like you.
                   (beat)
               I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes
               with you.

                          SAM
               Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll
               have to carry it for himself.  And I'm
               not any kind of Samurai.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You seem one to me.

                          SAM
               A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by
               the code of Bushido, the way of the
               warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.
                   (beat)
               The world isn't about honor, anymore.
               It's about survival.

     LONG BEAT.  Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre.
     He relaxes his finger on the hammer.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Survival.  I suppose that's as good a
               cause as any.

     BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun. BACK ON
     Sam and Jean-Pierre - And we're PULLING BACK, AWAY from the
     Farmhouse, which glows in the morning sun as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - DAY

     A BLACK COMPACT CAR sits in front of a Parisian Post Office.
     Inside the car, behind the wheel, we see Deirdre.  Now,
     coming out of the Post Office, we see - Gregor and Seamus
     Reilly.  Seamus has a coat slung over his arm, hiding the gun
     which he keeps pressed to Gregor's side.  There's no sign of
     the Briefcase as Seamus and Gregor get into -

     INT. THE CAR - SAM TIME

     THUNK!  The door slams shut.  Gregor and Seamus are in the
     back seat.  Almost instantly Seamus angrily snaps a pair of
     handcuffs on Gregor.  Immediately, Deirdre pulls out.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where's the case?

                          GREGOR
                   (nervous)
               There's a problem...

                          SEAMUS
                   (jumping all over him)
               Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to
               me, and if you are you're a dead man!

                          DEIRDRE
               Would somebody tell me what fucking well
               happened in there?

                          SEAMUS
                   (disgusted)
               Nothing.

                          GREGOR
                   (eager to explain)
               The package didn't come.  I'm sure it
               will tomorrow.

     Suddenly Seamus seems to lose it.  He grabs Gregor and slams
     a gun against his head.

                          SEAMUS
                   (he's almost foaming at the
                    mouth)
               If you're lying to me you poor excuse for
               a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains
               all over this car.

                          GREGOR
                   (beyond desperate)
               I swear, it has to come here!  It has
               to...

     BEAT.  For one tension-filled moment, we think Seamus is
     going to splash Gregor's brains all over the place.  But then
     he smiles, puts his weapon away, and pats Gregor gently on
     the face.

                          SEAMUS
               Ease up, man...I'm just checking to make
               sure you're on the level.

     Gregor is beyond speech -- he can only whimper.

                          SEAMUS
               And it seems to me I saw a sign in there
               that says they got a late afternoon
               delivery.  Why don't we come back later
               today and do this all over again, huh?

     Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit
     sadistic.  Neither Gregor nor Deirdre smiles in return as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - PARIS - DAY

     THE EIFFEL TOWER fills our eyes.  And then we PULL BACK TO
     REVEAL that it's a tacky, flyblown poster on a dingy street.
     And now we're -

     MOVING DOWN the Street, until we come to a store whose sign
     advertises in English - HONG KONG MOVIES.  The windows of the
     store are filled with posters.  We MOVE THROUGH TO

     INT. THE STORE - SAME TIME

     TONY SIMON, an expatriate black American, runs this place and
     lives above it.  His shelves are lined with action films made
     in the Far East.  Tony knows everything there is to know
     about the films he sells -- but he also knows quite a bit
     about what's going on in the Parisian Underworld.  he's a
     professional information broker.  Right now he's talking to a
     CUSTOMER in perfect French, with English Subtitles.

                          TONY
               Hey, man, they're both great movies.  One
               is more of a character study, the other
               is more of a straight action thing, but
               they're great movies, and he's an amazing
               fucking filmmaker.

     Tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention.

                          TONY
               Excuse me...

     Vincent and Sam have entered the store.  Sam's ability to be
     back on his feet in such a short time is amazing -- but we
     can see that he's not the same guy he was at the start of the
     film.  what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of
     will.  Now - Tony moves to join them, and the conversation
     immediately turns to English.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent)
               My man, how you doing?

                          VINCENT
               I'm alright.  And you?

                          TONY
               Doing well.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               This is?

                          VINCENT
               A friend.  I was telling him about how
               you always have the latest tapes.

                          TONY
               Why don't we step into my office...

     Tony's office, it turns out, is the area behind the COUNTER.
     Tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get
     to the other side, and then he closes it behind him.

                          TONY
               So what can I do for you?

     Vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking.  The
     place is empty except for - The single Customer Tony was just
     talking to.  The Customer is still considering the two films
     Tony was showing him.

                          VINCENT
               I was wondering if you had any movies
               that were particularly new.

                          TONY
               Matter of face there's this flick I've
               been hearing about.  I haven't seen it,
               but from what I hear it's pretty cool.

                          SAM
               What's the story?

                          TONY
               It's an international thing.  Several
               different peoples involved, criminals
               from all over the world, experts brought
               together to do a job.  But maybe the most
               interesting thing about it is that
               preeminent in the plot we find the
               Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together.
               An unlikely group of partners.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have the tape?

                          TONY
               I might know where you could get a copy.

     The Customer approaches the counter.  He has both tapes with
     him.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent and Sam)
               Let me do some business with my boy here,
               and I'll meet you across the street in
               five.  I gotta make homes here feel like
               he's getting a good deal while I give him
               the pleasure of overpaying me for a
               couple of second generation pirates.

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     The Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a
     great fucking deal he just got!  A few seconds later, Tony
     comes out and locks up the store front.  He crosses the
     street towards -

     INT. A FALAFEL JOINT - A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT

     A HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end.
     We PULL BACK ON - Tony, who's just taken a bite out of the
     falafel.  He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and
     Sam.

                          TONY
                   (his mouth full)
               What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of
               talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of
               it at first, cause, like I said, the
               Irish and the Russians are an unlikely
               mix.

                          VINCENT
               You said you might know where we can get
               a copy of this tape?

                          TONY
               All depends on whether you want the
               Russian or the Gaelic language version.

                          SAM
                   (instantly)
               Gaelic.

                          TONY
               You sure?

                          SAM
               I'm sure.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Tony)
               Can you get it?

                          TONY
               The Russian would be easier.

                          SAM
               Why's that?

                          TONY
               Cause the Russian production company
               would be easier to find.

                          SAM
               It's the Irish tape we want.

                          TONY
                   (with a sigh)
               Gonna be tough.

     Tony scribbles something on a piece of paper.

                          TONY
               Last I heard there was a film rep for the
               Irish players staying at this address,
               name of Seamus Reilly.

                          SAM
                   (repeating it, he knows this
                    name)
               Seamus Reilly.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               You know him?

                          SAM
               I know of him.

                          TONY
               Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish
               Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his
               more moderate filmmaking brethren have
               turned to making movies for peace-loving
               pussies, if you see what I'm saying.

                          VINCENT
               I get the picture.

     Sam reaches for the piece of paper, but Vincent puts his hand
     on top of it.

                          VINCENT
               Tony and I have to talk some business,
               first.

                          TONY
               I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to
               moan about the price, we settle somewhere
               in the middle.

                          VINCENT
               It's a matter of respect.
                   (to Sam)
               Why don't you wait outside, this won't
               take long.

     Sam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards
     the exit.  Behind him in rapid-fire French, Tony and Vincent
     are now discussing the price of the information.  They are
     both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying
     themselves immensely.

     EXT. THE FALAFEL SHOP - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Vincent exits the shop and gets into -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT

     Where Sam sits in the passenger seat as Vincent slides behind
     the wheel.  Vincent tosses Sam a piece of paper.

                          SAM
               The Irish representative?

                          VINCENT
               Yes.

     Vincent gives Sam another piece of paper.

                          SAM
               What's this?

                          VINCENT
               The address of the Russian production
               company.  Just in case we need to find
               them.

                          SAM
               Thorough man.

     Vincent starts the car and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - LATER - AFTERNOON

     The Peugeot sits, parked at a cub, a discreet distance from -
     AN APARTMENT HOUSE: 35 Rue de Glacon.  We PUSH IN on the -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT - LATE AFTERNOON

     A PIECE OF PAPER scarwled with the same address: 35 de
     Glacon.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL -

     Sam, holding this paper and looking out at the apartment
     complex.

                          SAM
               You sure your friend got the right place?

                          VINCENT
               If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

     BEAT.  Vincent wants to know something important.

                          VINCENT
               Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?

                          SAM
               Do what?

                          VINCENT
               Continue when it would be so much easier
               to give it up.

                          SAM
               It's my job.

                          VINCENT
               Then quit.
                   (beat)
               You don't work for Interpol, Sam.

                          SAM
               Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the
               guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard
               said.

                          VINCENT
               It's a cover, then.  A cover within a
               cover, a feint within a feint.
                   (quick beat)
               You work for the CIA, it's the only
               possible answer.

     LONG BEAT.  Sam considers what to say, and then decides he
     owes Vincent the truth.

                          SAM
               I'm a field agent -- last of an already
               extinct breed.  I do dark ops.

                          VINCENT
               Dark ops?

                          SAM
               Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping.
               Assassination.

                          VINCENT
               Very ugly.

                          SAM
               It is at that.

                          VINCENT
               Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much
               the modern Samurai after all.

                          SAM
               I never made that claim.

                          VINCENT
               I know.  Jean-Pierre did.

                          SAM
               You were behind the door?

                          VINCENT
               I was waiting to see what would happen.
               I didn't want to kill him if I didn't
               have to.

                          SAM
               You would have done that?

                          VINCENT
               I would have tried not to.  But yes, if
               it would have kept him from shooting you,
               I would have.

                          SAM
                   (almost to himself)
               How could you have done that?

                          VINCENT
               Because I owe you.
                   (he sees something)
               Look at that...

     THEIR POV: Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits the
     apartment building.

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (quietly exultant)
               All things come to those who wait.

     Now Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
                   (really surprised by this)
               He's not dead.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (figuring it out)
               They don't have the package.

                          VINCENT
               You think?

                          SAM
               You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.
               If they had the package, they'd have
               killed him.

     Vincent and Sam exchange a look -- now they both figure it
     out.

                          VINCENT & SAM
                   (simultaneously)
               They're going to get it.

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE POST OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

     A HAND signs a receipt, and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at
     a counter, signing for his package, which slides across the
     counter.  It's the Briefcase, although it's been wrapped in
     BROWN PAPER for its journey through the French Postal System.
     Now we see that - Seamus is still right beside Gregor; is, in
     face, almost on top of him, with a hand in his coat pocket
     which lets us know where his gun is.  Now - The two men start
     to move towards the exit as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A MINUTE LATER/LATE AFTERNOON

     The Black Compact Car idles at a nearby curb, with Deirdre
     behind the wheel.  She's staring so intently at the front of
     the post office, that she's surprised when a SHADOW falls
     across her.  She looks up to see - Sam, standing next to the
     car.  Deirdre starts to reach for her weapon, but Sam cuts
     her off with a word.

                          SAM
               Don't do it...

     Something in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she
     backs off.  Now she and Sam exchange a long look.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.
                   (she really sounds betrayed)
               I can't believe I misjudged you like I
               did.

                          SAM
               Oh please..you're on some sort of holy
               mission?

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm a patriate.

                          SAM
               Don't even think that I'm buying that.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where do you get off saying word one?
               All the time pretending to be one of us,
               it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus
               and myself.  And here you are so high and
               mighty, like you're so different from the
               rest of us.

                          SAM
               I didn't say I was.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she sees something)
               Bloody fucking hell...

     CUT AWAY TO: Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post office.
     By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor.
     Unseen by these two men - Vincent is approaching from the
     side, on an intercept course, his hand inside a bag which he
     carries with him.  Now - Deirdre turns and shoots Sam a look.
     He's still watching her keenly, and we can see that she's
     aching to reach for her piece, but she can't because Sam is
     still on her like a hawk.

                          SAM
               Don't even think it.

     He pulls back the folds of his suit jacket, revealing his
     gun, putting his hand comfortably on the pistol grip.

                          SAM
               I'd kill you before you had it halfway
               out.

     Vincent is closing on Gregor and Seamus, another ten seconds
     and he'll have them.

     Now - Deirdre looks back at Sam, then back at the situation
     developing in front of her, and then suddenly - She slams the
     car into gear and drives off, tires squealing while - Sam
     pulls his piece, sighting down the barrel and - He can't do
     it, can't shoot Deirdre.  Now - The sound of the car alerts
     Seamus, who turns in time to see - Vincent, who is raising
     the bag wrapped around his hand as - The car flies directly
     at - Vincent, who if forced to jump out of the way even as he
     pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag.  The end
     of the bag explodes in a burst of fire, but the shots are off
     the mark - Missing Seamus and Gregor as - Vincent rolls out
     of the way, just in time, while - Deirdre brakes the car to a
     screaming halt, as Seamus pushes Gregor in ahead of him and
     then gets in.  Seconds later, the car pulls out, even as -
     Sam drives up in the Peugeot to Vincent, who picks himself up
     off the ground and leaps into the car.  The last thing we
     hear is the sound of Sam's Voice as the Peugeot drives off.

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Put your seatbelt on.

     CUT TO:

     INT./EXT. - CAR CHASE MONTAGE

     During this SEQUENCE, we'll JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two cars and
     the streets they travel through.  Now - The Black Compact Car
     flies down a small street, followed closely by - The Peugeot,
     where Sam is driving as Vincent tries to steady his gun to
     get a clear shot at the other Car.

     INSIDE THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               What the fuck happened?

                          SAM
               I don't know...

                          VINCENT
               You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her,
               there was no way out.

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Deirdre is driving for dear life, while Seamus is
     freaking out.

                          SEAMUS
               What in bloody hell is going on?

                          DEIRDRE
               They're part of the team.  One of them's
               the guy I told you about.

                          SEAMUS
               From Interpol?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's him.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Why didn't you kill her?

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               Why didn't you kill him?

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     The two cars SLAM through the traffic, heading for a HIGHWAY
     RAMP which appears now perhaps two blocks away.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (figuring it out)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               How is it these fellahs managed to get
               the drop on us?

                          DEIRDRE
               I told you: they're good...

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     THE TWO CARS have reached the highway ramp, and as first one,
     and then the other pulls onto the highway, we PULL BACK AND
     UP TO REVEAL:

     THE PERIFERIQUE -

     The massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
     city of Paris.  Right away we notice that this entrance ramp
     leads to a traffic circle, filled with various off ramps
     which lead to no less than four different sections of the
     Periferique.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (slamming the dashboard in
                    disgust)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
                   (lecturing Deridre)
               You should have kill him when you had
               the chance.  But no...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               You put everything on the line because
               you...

     IN THE COMPACT

                          SEAMUS
                   (as if finishing Vincent's
                    sentence)
               You slept with the fucker!!

     ON THE PERIFERIQUE -

     THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle,
     while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the
     roadways.

                     VINCENT (O.S.)
          Fuck...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Left left left!!!

     Sam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps: one to the
     right, one to the center, and one to the - Left.  At the last
     second he takes the left turn as we go back to -

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening
     Gregor.  Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
     the other.

                          SEAMUS
                   (waving the package)
               This better be the real thing or you're a
               dead man!

                          GREGOR
               It is, I'm telling you it is!!

                          SEAMUS
               You've told me a lot of things, boyo...

     ZING-SHATTER!  A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield
     as - The Peugeot is catching up, and Vincent is leaning out
     of his window, firing away.  Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               Lose them!

                          DEIRDRE
               You lose them!

     Deirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the Compact takes a
     screaming turn, followed by - The Peugeot, and now they're
     both speeding towards another junction, where several other
     roadways of the Periferique run together.  Now we see that -
     Seamus is returning Vincent's fire, even as - The Junction
     approaches, and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               To the right!!!

     Deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now
     on an -

     EXIT RAMP, going against heavy traffic.  Now -

     Deirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars,
     but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along,
     and now -

     One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down
     the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt
     as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained
     by their seatbelts.  The car has stalled, and Sam has to
     start her up again and slam it into gear before following
     after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
     yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow
     after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway
     ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL
     BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying
     through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now -
     The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.

                          SAM
               Give me a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
               Right now?

                          SAM
               Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!

                          VINCENT
                   (fumbling with a cigarette)
               Why are you driving?
                   (rapid fire)
               You're not French, you don't live here,
               you don't know these roads.  Why are you
               driving?

     He puts the cigarette in Sam's mouth and as he does - The
     Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on
     the Compact, and now - SCREEEEECCHHH!!!!  About fifteen cars
     pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The
     Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus
     breathes a hugh sigh of relief.

                          SEAMUS
               About time!

                          DEIRDRE
                   (glancing in her mirror) 
               Not yet...

     The Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up, and it's
     back on their tail.

                          SEAMUS
                   (practically tearing his hair)
               Good Christ!  Can't you lose these
               jokers?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (through clenched teeth)
               They're good!

     And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car,
     and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as -
     Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters
     in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see -

     A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed
     off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the
     Compact Car is headed right for it, and now -

     Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact
     Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade
     rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre
     slams on the brakes as -

     Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in
     front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the
     Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
     Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as -
     The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and
     we're in SLOW MOTION as -

     Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but
     there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning
     her, even as -

     Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the
     windshield and flying through the air as -

     The Compact Car flips over and over and over while -

     Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life
     to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before
     the crash, and now -

     Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face
     sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive
     as -

     Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the
     exit ramp as -

     Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car,
     carrying the Briefcase with him, as -

     Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is
     now - On fire, and now -

     Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go
     back, because -

     A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident,
     and it's too late to turn around, and even as -

     Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it -
     EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire -
     Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second,
     even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
     out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to
     pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.

     Now Deirdre pulls Seamus over the side of the embankment,
     right before the cops arrive, and the two of them roll/fall
     almost thirty down a steep incline, even as -

     Sam catches a quick glimpse of -

     Gregor, scurrying away from the highway, carrying the
     Briefcase, and now Sam has to gun his car and get gone,
     because the Cops have reached -

     The Wreck, which is quickly burning itself out, and as the
     Cops look into the debris they see that -

     THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.  Everybody's gone.

     FADE OUT.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               We don't have much time.

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. VINCENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A FRONT DOOR, guarded by about five heavy locks, opens and
     Vincent and Sam enter.  Sam looks around and surveys the
     apartment.

                          SAM
               Nice place.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see the rest of the apartment: there's
     practically nothing here.  A table with a couple of chairs, a
     fridge.  An open door leads to a bedroom with a small, spare
     bed and a nightstand with a cheap lamp.

                          VINCENT
                   (by way of explaining)
               I'm not here very much.

                          SAM
               Business keeps you on the road?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that.

     The two men crass the room towards - A METAL CABINET which is
     tucked into a nook in the wall - VINCENT'S HAND turns a heavy-
     duty COMBINATION LOCK and then: Click, the cabinet opens and
     we see -- WEAPONS.  An endless cache of guns, knives,
     explosives, surveillance devices, gun scopes -- you name it,
     it's here.  Now Vincent's Hands reach into the cabinet and
     start taking out weapons.  We PULL BACK ON -

     Vincent, who gives the weapons to Sam.  Sam checks to make
     sure the weapons are loaded and/or ready for use, and then
     piles them, one on top of the other.

                          SAM
               I know I don't need to say this to you,
               but I need to say it to you.
                   (beat)
               This is my job, I have to do it.

                          VINCENT
               So I do it.

                          SAM
               No you don't, and you know it.

                          VINCENT
               If our positions were reversed, would you
               leave me?

                          SAM
                   (he says this too quickly)
               In a minute.

                          VINCENT
               I think not.

     BEAT.  Sam can't say anything, because he knows that what
     Vincent is saying is true.

                          VINCENT
                   (considering the weapons)
               Do we need anything else?

                          SAM
               Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

     Vincent thinks about this for a seoncd -- and then burst out
     laughing as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. ANOTHER CAR - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

     Deirdre once behind the wheel.  The passenger seat next to
     her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they
     flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror,
     which reveals -

     A glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.  Crashing
     through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever
     changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing
     wounds and burn tissue.  In his eyes we see the light of a
     sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge.

                          DEIRDRE
               You better be careful, Seamus, before
               something happens a plastic surgeon can't
               fix.

                          SEAMUS
                   (a hideous laugh)
               Plastic fucking surgeon?
                   (indicates his face)
               You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre
               lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and
               I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those
               who done it to me, I'll take my pound of
               flesh before this is all over.

                          DEIRDRE
               You're thinking with your gun, Seamus,
               and not your head...

                          SEAMUS
                   (losing it)
               Shut up!!!
                   (he puts a gun to her head)
               Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior
               officer and you will do as I goddamn well
               say, is that understood?!?

     BEAT.  Deirdre bristles at Seamus's words but says nothing.

                          SEAMUS
               Do I need to repeat myself?

                          DEIRDRE
               No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR - SAME TIME

     THE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does -

     A LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A CHATEAU OUTSIDE OF PARIS - NIGHT

     THE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.  The
     mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which
     shine from - THE CHATEAU.  Hundreds of years old, it sits far
     back from its own MAIN GATE.  In front of the Chateau - ARMED
     MEN.  Lots of them.  Whatever this place is, it's not one
     that invites company.  Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the
     Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding
     environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private
     gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has
     it.  We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN.
     Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like "Da!" and
     "Nyet!" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of
     the Russian Production Company.  BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE
     GARDENS, more everything.  It's well-patrolled, but there
     aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front,
     because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress -

     A WOODS -

     A forest, really.  Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic
     in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this
     place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.  And
     in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam.
     Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles
     through the woods to get here.  Both men exhausted from the
     walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit.
     They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.  Even
     though they're screened from the chateau back here, Sam
     reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincent's hands.

                          SAM
               Not here.  They might see it.

                          VINCENT
               If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm
               going to go out smoking.
                   (takes the cigarettes back and
                    lights one)
               Besides, there's half a forest between us
               and them, they can't see a goddamned
               thing.

     Vincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of
     his head.

                          SAM
               Time to quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just like that?

                          SAM
               Not just like that... Just before I turn
               around and it's six months from now and
               the first thing I do when I wake up in
               the morning is light a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
                   (obviously he does this)
               What of it?
                   (almost to himself)
               Samurai pain in the ass.

                          SAM
                   (he hates this)
               Would you stop with that...

                          VINCENT
               Why?  You've got more force of will than
               anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun
               like it's a part of you, you perform
               surgery on yourself without anesthesia...
                   (quick beat)
               And most amazing of all, you quit
               smoking, just like that.

                          SAM
                   (qith a cynical laugh)
               The mark of a true Samurai.
                   (seriously)
               What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no
               different than what you do.  We're both
               hired guns, and this is a job -- like any
               other job.

                          VINCENT
               Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is
               a job like any other?  Surely, if you are
               a hired gun, you realize that some times
               you just have to walk away without
               getting what you came for.

                          SAM
               Because I don't walk away.

                          VINCENT
               Why not?

                          SAM
               It's the one thing I've got left to hold
               onto.
                   (beat)
               Jean-Pierre is one of your closest
               friends, is he not?

                          VINCENT
               Closest and oldest.

                          SAM
               And yet you would have killed him to save
               my life.
                   (quick beat)
               You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that
               I can't even remember anymore.  I don't
               know that I ever even had it to begin
               with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to
               finish my job.

                          VINCENT
               And when you finish?  What then?  This
               package, whatever it is, do you give it
               to the CIA?  Do you really think they
               deserve it?

                          SAM
               That's a good question.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have a good answer?

                          SAM
                   (he's really just considering
                    this)
               No, I don't.

     INT. THE CHATEAU - MEANWHILE

     ARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon
     squad.

     MOVING THROUGH the Chateau itself, and from in here we see
     the side of France we haven't yet seen in this film: culture.
     Each room could be a museum, as we move through -

     A GALLERY, filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters -

     A PARLOR, with antique furniture, the youngest piece of which
     is two hundred years old -

     A BALLROOM, empty and barren, but lit by the dazzling light
     of an exquisite chandelier -

     A KITCHEN, where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the
     finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal
     you've ever seen.  Now - A SERVANT takes the tray and carries
     it out to -

     A DINING ROOM, and the table is set for a formal dinner for
     twenty, with crystal and china at every place setting, and
     yet the table is occupied by only one man -

     MIKHAEL RACHEV, Russian Gangster Supreme, called Mikhi.  Now -

     The Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi, and as this
     chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL
     BACK, MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table.

     EXT. THE CHATEAU WALLS - NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out.
     Attached to his wrist, by that same handcuff: the Briefcase.
     Gregor is admitted by a Guard as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE DINING ROOM/CHATEAU - A LITTLE LATER

     Mikhi the Gangster is eating his dinner as Gregor is ushered
     into the room.  THREE THUGS hang back behind Gregor, watching
     to see what Mikhi wants.  Now -

     Mikhi waves the Thugs out of the room, leaving Gregor alone
     with the gangster.  Mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as
     he motions for Gregor to sit.

                          MIKHI
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Sit, sit...
                   (offering a cigarette)
               Would you like one?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.
                   (letting that sink in for a
                    minute)
               Since I won't speak your language, and
               you can't speak mine, English will do
               nicely.

                          MIKHI
                   (makes no never mind to him)
               Whatever you wish...
                   (lights his own cigarette)
               This has all been a terrible mistake,
               Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with
               you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill
               you.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard said the same thing about you
               before he died.

                          MIKHI
               I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd
               believe him.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly sharp)
               Enough!

     Gregor raises the Briefcase which is still attached to his
     wrist via the handcuff.  Gregor rests the Briefcase on the
     table.

                          MIKHI
               Ahh...

     The moment of truth.  Before this scene can develop any
     further, a VOICE comes from Off Screen, and as the Voice
     speaks, Gregor blanches.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               The moment of truth, is it?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre and Seamus have entered the room.
     And we notice something unusual: nobody is alarmed (except
     for Gregor, that is).  It's as if they were expected.

                          GREGOR
               What is he doing here?

     As Seamus speaks he walks through the room, examining the
     valuable china and crystal, all the while moving inexorably
     closer to Gregor.  His face is, if anything, even more
     horrific than it was a short while ago, as his formerly fresh
     wounds have started to scab over.

                          SEAMUS
               What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to
               see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the
               Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had
               hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull
               your thieving double cross.  But they
               only just found out that what's in the
               briefcase is completely useless without
               me.  I can't fight them, and they can't
               kill me -- that means we're gonna have to
               do business together.

                          GREGOR
               But you hate each other!

                          SEAMUS
               What's a little hate between business
               partners?

     EXT. THE WOODS - MEANWHILE

     Vincent's CIGARETTE is stubbed into a rock and the two men
     rise with a slow purpose.  They exchange a look and then Sam
     steps forward, leading the way

                          SAM
               I'm on point, Vincent.

     A WIDE ANGLE - THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Pure Kurosawa.  The JAPANESE DRUM we've heard before starts
     to play again as -

     THE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and
     into the brilliant light of the back lawn.  For one minute
     they stand still, and among the many weapons that Sam carries
     is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the
     SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword.  Now
     the two men start to move across the lawn, hugging the
     shadows of the various statues and hedges, trying to keep
     from being discovered for as long as possible.

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

                          GREGOR
                   (to Seamus)
               So, you've got it all figured, do you?

                          SEAMUS
               Figured enough to know there's an odd man
               out and I'm looking at him.

                          GREGOR
               I think not.
                   (holds up the Briefcase)
               I have, of course, taken the precaution
               of wiring the briefcase to explode five
               seconds after it opens.  Unless, of
               course, I deactivate it before it goes
               off.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (under her breath)
               That fucking figures...

                          GREGOR
               Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll
               kill myself and whoever happens to be
               near me at the time.

                          MIKHI
               And more importantly --

                          GREGOR
               I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

     BEAT.  Nobody moves.  Nobody speaks.  Until finally -

                          SEAMUS
               It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna
               have to sit down to table and work out an
               agreement.

     Before this entirely too-weird scenario can play itself we go
     back to -

     THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are closer to the Chateau, moving in stealth,
     avoiding any entanglements and then Sam turns a corner and
     comes face to face with - A GUARD, and his gun is aimed at
     Sam's head: Sam's a dead man as we go -

     BACK TO THE DINING ROOM

     AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE splits the night, and everyone in the
     room looks at one another, before Mikhi speaks.

                          MIKHI
               What was that?

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     The Guard who had Sam in his sights falls down, dead, shot by
     - Vincent, whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms.
     Vincent smiles at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               That's one less I owe you...

     Sam smiles, but it's no time to get satisfied.  their
     presence revealed, there's no point in moving quietly.  Sam
     draws his weapons and as he and Vincent charge across the
     lawn towards the Chateau while -

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

     MORE GUNSHOTS from outside -- not a war, but enough to cause
     serious alarm.  Deirdre, ever the soldier, draws her two
     automatic pistols.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Seamus and Mikhi)
               You two stay here and watch our mutual
               interest.

     She nods at Gregor and his Briefcase, indicating what this
     mutual interest is.  Then she turns and bolts the room, and
     as she does we're -

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are running along, hugging the ground and
     whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire
     rips into the ground around them, Russian thugs not even sure
     what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam
     and Vincent hurtle towards -

     A BACK ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU -

     Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent
     burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in
     from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent
     are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then -
     They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol
     in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when
     he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only
     when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights
     with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in
     the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves,
     and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is
     quiet.  Everybody's dead except for Sam and Vincent.  They
     drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they
     move towards - THE DOOR - It leads to two passages, each one
     leading to a separate wing of the chateau.

                          SAM
               Let's work our way through the building.
               I'll take one wing, you take the other.

     Vincent and Sam split up, moving into separate WINGS of the
     Chateau, and as they move off Sam speaks a word of warning.

                          SAM
               Watch your back, Vincent.

     And then they're gone, and we're with -

     Deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to
     room, and we're with her for a minute, the JAPANESE DRUM
     starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more
     drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and
     suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard, dragging
     Deirdre's attention towards -

     THE BALLROOM -

     And Sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three
     Gunmen.  He kills the first, and then the second, and then -
     No third.  The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam
     fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide,
     ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor
     with glass.  And now we're -

     ON DEIRDRE -

     Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
     gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead.  Deirdre has
     almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out, and
     the two of them CRASH TOGETHER, sending the two of them
     sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the
     Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground, Sam loses his
     weapon in the fall, but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of
     her two guns.  Now the two of them roll to their feet, and as
     they do we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse
     than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
     his face is becoming more grotesque.  Little pustules have
     started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish
     viscous liquid.  A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard,
     and Seamus, who is no longer capable of thinking straight,
     loses it.

                          SEAMUS
               I can't take it anymore.
                   (to Mikhi)
               Watch him, man, I'm going out and finish
               what needs finishing!

     And Seamus is gone, and so are we -- back to -

     THE BALLROOM -

     Where Deirdre has her two guns pointed at Sam and - Does nothing.
     BEAT.

                          SAM
               Go on, them...

     But Deirdre can't do it.  There's something between these
     two, and now - Sam looks around and sees Deirdre's other
     pistol lying on a broken chair, and now he -

     Kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg, causing it to
     function as a lever, sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR in a
     graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sam's Hand.  Now
     he's armed and he looks back at - Deirdre.  Her FINGER
     tightens on the trigger, she's almost ready to shoot -- if
     Sam raises his piece, he's a dead man.

                          DEIRDRE
               Let it go, Sam, walk away.

     In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he
     smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways, into a
     nearby corridor, vanishing.

                          DEIRDRE
               God damn it!

     She runs after him but she's too late -- The corridor outside
     is empty.  Now we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     With Gregor and Mikhi, and the tension is unbearable, because
     they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and
     then stops, but they don't have the least idea of what's
     going on.  Still, Mikhi won't let Gregor leave without giving
     up the Briefcase.  Mikhi has a gun on Gregor, who in turn
     holds the Briefcase close, ready to open it and set off the 5
     Second Timer that will blow it up.

                          GREGOR
                   (a feral hiss)
               We'll die if we stay here!

                          MIKHI
                   (threatening with the gun)
               You'll die if you leave here.

     Gregor sits back down, fairly close to Mikhi.  Then, in a
     manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices, Gregor extracts
     a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the
     Briefcase.  Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm
     forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's
     throat.  Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade,
     already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
     slashed artery.  Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground,
     jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up
     the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move
     to - 

     THE GALLERY -

     Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200
     years old.  This place is a maze, what with it's walls of
     paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors
     which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block
     sight lines.  Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a
     gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting
     him down.  We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split
     up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian
     voices.  Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -
     Nothing.  No Vincent.  Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES
     through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.  It's
     Vincent.  His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him
     in place.  Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the
     painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.  Now - The other men
     are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps
     out firing -

     And now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them,
     using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage,
     gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then -
     No four.  Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where
     he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting
     Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.  The Last Guy has
     the drop on Vincent.  Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty
     little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A
     BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.  It's Sam.  Now
     Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved
     Vincent's life.

                          VINCENT
               You have to stop doing that!

                          SAM
               I'll work on it...

     The two men don't have time for any more words, they move
     from the Gallery and find themselves in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Where they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the
     Gangster.  Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a
     VOICE comes from BEHIND them -

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               Turn around real slow, and try hard not
               to breathe when you do it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them, and
     he's got his gun pointed straight at Sam's heart.  If Seamus
     is enraged at discovering Gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to
     find Sam in his place.

                          SEAMUS
               It's you...
                   (touches his face)
               You're the one did this to my face, are
               you?

                          SAM
               That's me.

                          SEAMUS
               Have a nice afterlife.

     Seamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards
     Sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent
     leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side,
     a huge splash of red against his white shirt.  He falls to
     the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time,
     and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS
     RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal,
     taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the
     table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV
     showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then
     suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other
     - Mexican Standoff.  Suddenly, from Off Screen -

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Seamus!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the
     two men.

                          SEAMUS
               Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking
               bullet in his head!

     Deirdre hesitates, uncertain.

                          SEAMUS
               Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can
               find that stinking Gregor, he's got the
               bloody package!  For God's sake, you're a
               soldier...

     These last words sink into Deirdre: she is a soldier.  Her
     gun swivels towards Sam.

                          SEAMUS
                   (sensing he's getting to
                    her)
               You're one of us...You been born and bred
               with your own people, you can't go
               against your nature.  C'mon, girl, I'm
               you're people.

     Deirdre makes up her mind.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm no girl, Seamus...

     She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a
     huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you ain't nobody's people.

     She moves with Sam to Vincent, who is seriously wounded --
     perhaps life-threateningly so.

                          SAM
                   (to Deirdre)
               Let's get him out of here...

                          VINCENT
               Finish the job...

                          SAM
               And now...

                          VINCENT
                   (a commanding whisper)
               Finish it!

     Sam considers, but before he can make up his mind, Deirdre
     sees something through the wreck of the Dining Room Window -

     OUT ON THE BACK LAWN - We've already seen that it's bordered
     on one side by the woods, for the first time we notice - A
     LAKE, which laps against a PRIVATE DOCK, where a row boat is
     tethered.  Now - BENEATH A VERY FULL MOON, the stark figure
     of Gregor makes its way toward the Dock.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (calling out)
               Sam...

     Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making
     his escape.  Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed
     out from blood loss.

                          VINCENT
               I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go
               out and get the bastard.

     Same makes up his mind, and as Vincent passes out, Sam runs
     out after Deirdre and towards -

     THE PRIVATE DOCK -

     And as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM.

                          DEIRDRE
               He's got the briefcase rigged to explode
               five seconds after anybody other than
               himself tries to open it.

     And now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no
     Gregor.  And the Boat is still there.  Before Sam can
     restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat.

                          SAM
               Deirdre, wait up --

     But it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind -

     A BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what
     happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head.
     His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase, which is
     still handcuffed to his wrist.

                          GREGOR
               You might have made a good field agent
               you arrogant American prick, but you're
               not smart enough to go up against me.

     Gregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake.  This
     Private Dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the
     water is nearly five feet.  Sam has reached a position where
     there is no right answer.  Still, he points his gun at
     Gregor, who in turn shields himself with Deirdre's body.

                          GREGOR
               Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the
               bitch, I don't care.
                   (beat)
               And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting.
               Put down your weapon and walk away.

                          DEIRDRE
               Don't do it, Sam!

                          GREGOR
               Shut up!

                          DEIRDRE
               He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though
               me and kill this fucker.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
                   (a horrible croak)
               If you don't, I will...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus is somehow still barely alive -- he's
     not long for this world, but the will for revenge has driven
     him this far.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Sam, in a cold pale rage)
               Shoot that traitorous bitch and I'll let
               you live.

     THE TOP OF SEAMUS'S HEAD explodes, finishing him off once and
     for all, killed by -

     Vincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary
     shot.  But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own
     blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the
     boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET
     FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN -

     IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're
     in SLOW MOTION as -

     Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close
     the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the
     other, into the lake, while -

     BABOOM!  The case EXPLODES, a flash of phosphorescent white
     light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was
     inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and
     when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone, while -
     THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake, booming again and
     again until finally there is - SILENCE.  Sam looks out over
     the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none.  And
     then, after we've held for a BEAT longer than it should be
     possible for her to have survived - her head splits the
     surface and she emerges, coughing.  Sam reaches down to help
     her out.

                          SAM
               Are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in
               here!

     Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them
     immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we
     start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can
     be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.
     And we're STILL PULLING BACK ON -

     THE CHATEAU - Or what's left of it, because it's started to
     burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night,
     like something out of medieval times as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - NIGHT

     Sam waits outside a hospital room, inside of which we get a
     glimpse of - A DOCTOR tending to a heavily bandaged and
     sedated Vincent.  As Sam waits - TWO GENDARMES and a
     PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE approach.  The Detective looks at Sam
     for a BEAT, and then goes to push past him.  Sam blocks his
     way.

                          DETECTIVE
               I need to speak with that man.

                          SAM
               I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

     Sam reaches into his coat, and for a moment everybody thinks
     he's going for his gun, but instead he comes out with - A
     PIECE OF PAPER.  He hands it to the Detective.

                          SAM
               Call that number and ask them what you
               should do.

     The Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously.

     FIVE MINUTES LATER -

     The Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks
     over at Sam in disgust.  Without another word, the Detective
     signals to the two Gendarmes, and all three men exit.  Now -

     The DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to
     him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks
     back.  Everything in SUBTITLED.

                          DOCTOR
               You can see your friend, now.

                          SAM
               Thank you very much.

                          DOCTOR
               The field dressing you put on saved his
               life.
                   (giving him a look)
               Where di you learn to do that?

                          SAM
               Here and there, I guess.

     The Doctor isn't entirely satisfied with this answer, but
     it's the only one she's going to get, because Sam moves past
     into -

     INT. VINCENT'S ROOM

     He's barely alive -- but alive nonetheless.  And he's heard
     Sam speak in French to the Doctor.

                          VINCENT
               You son-of-a-bitch...

                          SAM
               What?

                          VINCENT
               You speak French.

                          SAM
               What of it?

                          VINCENT
                   (in mock exasperation)
               Nothing...

     He lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.

                          VINCENT
                   (repeating the Doctor's words
                    in English)
               "Your field dressing saved his life."
               That's three I owe you.

                          SAM
               You don't owe me a goddamned thing,
               Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in
               front of a bullet for me.
                   (very seriously, he now
                    believes this)
               I owe you a heavy debt.

                          VINCENT
                   (relishing this)
               I know.

                          SAM
                   (rising to leave)
               You better get some sleep, alright?

                          VINCENT
               Tell me something first.
                   (a quick beat)
               The package: what was it?

                          SAM
               I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a
               bunch of people who are too dead to tell
               us.  There's probably a couple of guys
               back at the Company who know, but I don't
               think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

                          VINCENT
               What happened to it?
     
                          SAM
               Gone.  Destroyed.

                          VINCENT
                   (sighs, then a beat)
               I guess that's for the best.

     Sam turns for the door but Vincent has one last thing to say.

                          VINCENT
               Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake,
               you could have killed the two of them
               with one shot.  You could have had the
               package, finished the job.  But you
               didn't, you sacrificed the job to save
               her life.  Why?

     Same has to think about this for a second, and his answer
     reveals just how full circle he's come.

                          SAM
               It's what you would have done.

     And on that note Sam exits the room, leaving a bemused
     Vincent behind.

     EXT. THE BANK OF THE RIVER SEINE - EARLY MORNING

     A WISPY FOG atmospherically rises off the river -- not too
     thick, not too thin.

     A TITLE: One month later...

     We're MOVING along the cobble-stone walk next to the river as
     a VOICE cuts through the fog.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               Would you just smoke already...

     A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam, Vincent and Deirdre are having
     morning coffee.  A mostly-healed Vincent is smoking a
     cigarette, trying to get Sam to light up.

                          SAM
               I told you, I quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate
               smoking alone.
                   (turning to Deirdre)
               How about you?  I thought all you IRA
               types smoked.

                          DEIRDRE
               Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill
               more patriots than bullets.
                   (a quick beat)
               Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

                          VINCENT
               So where do you go from here?

                          DEIRDRE
               I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the
               three of us might partner up -- guns for
               hire, that sort of thing.

                          VINCENT
               I'm up for that...

     The two of them turn to Sam, but he shakes his head.

                          SAM
               Not me.  You work too often with the same
               people and you become friends -- clouds
               your judgement.

                          DEIRDRE
               Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends
               already we wouldn't be here now, would
               we?

                          VINCENT
               She's got a point.
                   (playing a trump card)
               Besides, I know of a job that's
               available.

     Sam can't help it -- he's interested.

                          SAM
               How much does it pay?

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. OUT ON THE RIVER SEINE - MEANWHILE

     SILENCE AND FOG.  A RIVER FERRY does a slow ghostly glide
     down the river, and in seconds it approaches -

     THE RIVERSIDE CAFE, which appears through the mist, looked at
     by --

     A SLEEK PAIR OF SUN GLASSES attached to a young PUNK in a
     leather coat, and the Punk is looking at - Sam, Vincent, and
     especially: Deirdre.  Sam looks up and shouts a warning as -
     The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps
     the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent -

                          PUNK
               This is for Seamus!

     BOOM!  The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's
     gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The
     Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the
     Ferry which never stops as -

     THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS
     dropping their trays.  But - Sam doesn't run, and neither
     does Vincent.  Sam stands, stunned by what he sees - Deirdre
     lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead.  A
     BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance, but
     quickly growing closer.  Now - Vincent looks at Deirdre's
     corpse, then at Sam, who is unable to move.  For maybe the
     first time in his professional career, Sam is staggered by
     the loss of a life.  Vincent gently takes Sam's arm.

                          VINCENT
                   (soft yet urgent)
               We have to go, Sam, we can't be here.

     Sam looks at Vincent, and for a moment Sam struggles to find
     something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing.  The
     SIRENS are getting louder -

                          VINCENT
                   (a little louder, bordering
                    desperation)
               Let's go!!

     Vincent literally drags Sam away and now the SIRENS have
     arrived, followed quickly by - THE GENDARMES, who come
     running into the Cafe but - It's empty except for Deirdre's
     body.  Now -

     THE STREET ABOVE THE RIVER -

     Sam and Vincent are running through patchy fog, Vincent
     leading the way, and now -

     We're CLOSER ON Vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he
     feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to
     relax.  He collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving,
     shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for Sam.

                          VINCENT
                   (thrusting the cigarettes out to
                    Sam)
               Doctor's orders...

     But Sam isn't there to take the cigarette -- Vincent looks
     around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the
     fog has covered any sign of Sam.  Vincent stands there,
     stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that
     slowly falls back to Vincent's side as he realizes that Sam
     has left him on purpose.  Then - Vincent lights both
     cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the
     stone wall - THE GLOWING CIGARETTE arcs through the air until
     it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Goodbye, Sam...

     BACK AT THE CAFE -

     The Gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to
     secure since everyone has run away).  A majority of cops
     surround Deirdre's dead body, but - One GENDARME wanders
     around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something -

     ON THE STREET ABOVE -

     A SHAPE IN THE FOG.  The wind blows and the fog clears for a
     second, and we see that it's - Sam.  Getting one last look at
     Deirdre.  Quickly - The Gendarme points Sam out but as he
     does the wind continues to blow and - THE FOG swallows Sam.
     Seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does - Sam is
     gone.

     FADE OUT.
RONIN 

                      an original screenplay by

                              J.D. Zeik






                                             DRAFT: May 20, 1997







     A BLOOD RED SCREEN - A JAPANESE DRUM starts to play, softly,
     but tinged with a desperate edge, growing louder, joined by
     other DRUMS as a BLACK LEGEND scrolls up: In feudal Japan,
     the warrior class of Samurai were sworn to protect their
     liege lords with their lives.  Those Samurai whose liege was
     killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander
     the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits.  These
     masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai,
     they were known by another name: Such men were called Ronin.
     The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then
     the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft...

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. A MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     It's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're
     MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see
     is a medieval cathedral.  And as we continue MOVING UP
     something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.  Running thin,
     then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -
     A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs
     akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.  In one hand
     the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.  In the
     other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.
     FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame,
     silenced pistol dangling at his side.  We don't know him, and
     it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark
     his face because we'll see him again.  The Killer now picks
     up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A
     BRIEFCASE.  The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and
     turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.  The
     Killer shows them the Briefcase.

                          KILLER
               God loves me.

     THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead.
     The Killer raises his silenced pistol.

                          KILLER
                   (to his victim)
               But I don't think he's too fond of you...

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

     A PHONE RINGS, replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot
     we expected to hear.

     Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of
     streetlight.

     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH AT THE END OF THE STREET

     The source of the ringing.  We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the
     phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY
     AMERICAN.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (V.O.)
               What is this?

     CUT TO:

     INT. A DRIVE BAR IN PARIS - NIGHT

     A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the
     bar in this smokey, dim dive.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
               This is not football...

     And now we're PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR.  We
     see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar, paying no
     attention to each other.  One of these men watches the game
     with real interest.  The Ugly American talks on from off
     screen.

                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
               ...Football is three hundred pound guys,
               they run way too fucking fast, they got
               helmets made of kevlar they use to spear
               the quarterback into the next life.

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     The phone is still ringing, louder now, and we're MOVING
     TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES, and
     even as we drink this in we're back in -

     INT. THE BAR

     AT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY, the Ugly American.  He's got
     an obvious attitude, all of it bad.  But there's something
     about the guy -- he's not all bluster, and he has the look of
     a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble.
     He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks
     solid.

                          LARRY
                   (talking to the air)
               You wanna know what football is?  It's
               hitting the other guy dirty and then
               spitting in his face when he's down.
               Football is all things American, and
               American is A-Number-One the absolute
               fucking best there is.  That's what
               football is...
                   (he points to the TV)
               ...And that's not football.

     The one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns
     slowly and gives Larry a long look.  This is VINCENT: French,
     hard boiled and solid.  Charming when he wants to be, which
     isn't all that often.  He gives Larry a long look and then
     speaks -

                          VINCENT
                   (to Larry in perfect English)
               Football -- American football -- is a
               game for faggots.

     A BEAT.  The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough
     customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but
     they're interested: what's Larry going to say?  For a moment
     it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks
     out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark.
     Vincent joins in, as do the others.  In particular - THE
     BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar
     drunk, but these guys are in a different league.  The
     Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a
     confrontation as we go back to -

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE

     We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still
     ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone
     from its cradle.

                          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   (a touch Irish accent)
               Yes?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see a woman named DEIRDRE on the
     phone: striking, dark-haired, Irish.  She carries herself
     with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.
     Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end,
     and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE
     stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.  She
     gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her
     hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.

                          DEIRDRE
               Can I help you?

     The silhouette steps into a POOL OF LIGHT.  This is SAM.
     Tough, lean, enigmatic.  Somebody you might trust, but whom
     you'd never cross.  Sam returns her look before he speaks.

                          SAM
               No...

     Sam moves towards the bar, and Deirdre returns to her phone
     conversation.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm here...
                   (a beat, responding to a
                    question)
               No, it was nothing.

     INT. THE BAR - A MINUTE LATER

     Sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together
     at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all
     here for a reason.  With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR, a
     man from Eastern Europe.  His accent is hard to pin down,
     but he most definitely has one.  Gregor has the air of an ex-
     spook, and that's exactly what he is.  Lastly we see SWEDE --
     blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.  No, he's
     not stupid -- he's a sociopath.  Now - Sam looks at the
     group, which grows quiet as he enters.  Finally, Sam speaks.

                          SAM
               Sorry I'm late...

                          VINCENT
                   (a challenge)
               What makes you think we're here to meet
               you?

                          SAM
                   (meeting Vincent's gaze)
               Who else would you be?

     Vincent turns towards the others, including them in an
     expansive gesture.

                          VINCENT
               Perhaps the police?

                          SAM
               I know cops -- and you're no cop.

     Vincent smiles at Sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for
     Sam to join them.  Vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes
     them so that one sticks out, and offers it to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Cigarette?

                          SAM
               No thanks.

     Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go -

     EXT. BACK OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into
     the cradle.  Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in
     thought.  Then, without warning - Deirdre spins around,
     pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat.  The move is fast,
     performed with the grace of a professional killer, as Deridre
     scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching.  Deirdre
     pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street,
     the better to watch -

     THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her.
     PULLING BACK from Deirdre, UP INTO THE AIR and then MOVING
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. A CHEAP APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW, donw onto the street below.  Barely
     visible we can see Deirdre.  And staring at Deirdre - THE
     WATCHER.  Somebody we're going to see periodically through
     the movie.  Right now he's only a SILHOUETTE with a well-
     defined PAIR OF HANDS.  And in those hands - A KNIFE.  As the
     Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife,
     methodically, perfectly.  And he watches.  First Deirdre, and
     then turning his attention to THE BAR.  He's especially
     interested in the bar.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. THE BAR - LATER

     The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass.  When this is
     finished he looks up at -

     A TABLE IN THE BACK -

     Where our five guys have relocated.  Now the Bartender and
     Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a
     set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK
     into Vincent's hand.  The Bartender and Vincent speak in
     rapid-fire French, and then the Bartender is gone.  Sam turns
     to Vincent.

                          SAM
               He trusts you to lock up?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say he knows who I am.

     Vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them
     around the table -- again, nobody takes on.  Vincent seems
     really disappointed by this.

                          LARRY
               Anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting
               for?

                          VINCENT
                   (lighting his cigarette)
               The question isn't what we're waiting
               for... it's who.

                          LARRY
               And who the fuck is that?

                          GREGOR
               Whoever hired us.

                          SAM
               I got this gig through a contractor.
               And he most definitely didn't know who
               was doing the hiring, only that they
               were paying a lot of money...

     There's a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or
     grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men
     were hired the same way.

                          SAM
                   (continuing his thought)
               So none of us knows who's paying the
               freight, this is just some anonymous job.
               For all we know, we're working for
               different people.

                          GREGOR
               Now that is an interesting proposition.

                          SWEDE
               How so?

                          GREGOR
               Because if there's more than one party
               involved, if we really are working for
               different people, then perhaps some of us
               are on different sides.
                   (with great meaning)
               Your orders might be different from mine.

                          LARRY
               What're you talking about, man?  I don't
               understand.

                          SWEDE
                   (quietly, but loud enough to be
                    heard)
               What a surprise...

                          LARRY
               I got a surprise for you, blondie...

                          GREGOR
                   (sharply, as if he's used to
                    giving orders)
               Why don't both of you shut up?

                          LARRY & SWEDE
                   (to Gregor at the same time)
               Fuck you!

                          SAM
               Knock it off!

     There is a BEAT.  Gregor, Swede and Larry look at Sam, who
     glares them all down.  Lastly, Sam turns and looks at
     Vincent.  The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a
     kind of mutual respect.

                          SAM
               The point remains: we could be working
               for different people.  There's a chance
               for one of us...
                   (looks around the table)
               Maybe more than one of us -- has been
               paid to cross the others.  I don't know
               about you guys, but I like to know who
               I'm working for.  It can help prevent a
               great deal of...
                   (finding the right word)
               ...unpleasantness.

                          LARRY
                   (patting the gun inside his
                    cheap suit)
               Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put
               two between his eyes -- one to do the job
               and the other to make sure it takes.

     From OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound: LAUGHTER.  ANOTHER ANGLE -

     Deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last
     exchange.

                          DEIRDRE
               It's good to see you've all got such
               faith in our little undertaking.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck are you?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (staring at Larry)
               The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this
               show.

                          GREGOR
               Who are you?  IRA?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a brittle laugh)
               Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but
               there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and
               I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my
               meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the
               rest of you, and that's all any of us
               needs to know about the other.

     Deirdre hands out several thick envelopes.  Larry and Swede
     open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed
     inside.  Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his
     money.  But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look.

                          DEIRDRE
               From here on in you want something you
               pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank
               accounts are in place: ten percent up
               front, the rest when the job is done.
                   (a quick beat, then she looks
                    at Gregor)
               You.  What do you do and what should we
               call you?

                          GREGOR
               These days they they call me Gregor -- and
               I'm a tech.  I do electronic work,
               surveillance, computer runs.

     Deirdre turns to Sam.

                          SAM
               Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.

                          DEIRDRE
               You were a soldier, were you?

                          SAM
               Once.

     Deirdre gives Sam a look -- and he returns it.  Finally,
     Deirdre turns to Larry.

                          LARRY
               I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry
               from the States.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she turns to Vincent)
               And who are you?

                          VINCENT
               I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               Coordinate what?

                          VINCENT
               Things.  This is my country, you know.

     The two men exchange another look.  A pecking order is
     developing among the group: Vincent and Sam are both natural
     leaders, and now they're feeling one another out.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Vincent)
               Coordinate all you want, but make sure
               whatever you do gets cleared through me.
                   (Vincent doesn't respond for a
                    moment)
               Are we in sync on this, Vincent?

                          VINCENT
               Of course.

     Deirdre waits a BEAT, letting Vincent know what she isn't any
     more intimidated by him than he is by her.  Finally, she
     turns to Swede.

                          SWEDE
               They call me Swede.

                          LARRY
               Who's they?

                          SWEDE
               Everybody.

                          VINCENT
               And what is it you do?

                          SWEDE
               Me?
                   (with a smile)
               I kill.

     CUT TO:

     INT. A WAREHOUSE - DAY

     A PAPER TARGET, in the shape of a human being, dances in
     place as it is riddles with GUNSHOTS, each shot hitting the
     target in the belly, each shot fired by - Larry, whose been
     shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which he's just
     discharged an entire clip.  The gun is empty, Larry turns to
     Sam, who stands next in line.

                          SAM
                   (looking at the target)
               You shoot alright.

                          LARRY
               Gets the job done.

                          SAM
               All in the stomach, though.  Your man
               might live.

                          LARRY
               Not for long.

                          SAM
               Long enough to shoot back.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               It's been known to happen.

                          LARRY
                   (a challenge)
               Why don't you go do better, then...

     Without a word, Sam pops a new clip into the gun and SHOOTS
     THE LIGHTS out of several other human targets, hitting each
     target in a different place.  One he clips between the eyes,
     the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last
     target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE, firing shot after shot
     from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
     half.  Larry is impressed in spite of himself.

                          LARRY
               Yeah, well...  My way works too.

                          SAM
               My way is better.

     IN A CORNER OF THE WAREHOUSE -

     Gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and
     electronic whizmos.  Right now Gregor is holding a
     particularly high-tech type CELL PHONE in his hands, looking
     at it almost lovingly.

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Is it alright?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre sits nearby, looking at the cell
     phone.

                          GREGOR
               It's quite satifactory.

                          DEIRDRE
               Good, because it cost enough.  There's
               cheaper phones by far than that one, man:
               you better fucking use it.

                          GREGOR
                   (almost caressing the phone)
               I intend to.  This phone is wired like no
               other: it's got an encryption chip and
               instant sat-a-link recognition, it can
               talk to any computer in any language and
               make it understand.  With my custom
               hardware and this phone I can trace the
               target's cell phone signature and follow
               him anywhere he goes...

                          DEIRDRE
               You sure about this?

                          GREGOR
               I'd stake my reputation.

                          DEIRDRE
               But would you stake your life, that's the
               question...

                          GREGOR
               In this business, your life and your
               reputation are more often than not one
               and the same.

     From off screen we hear MUNCHING.  It's - Larry inhaling a
     sandwich.  A malicious look comes over Swede's face, who's
     cleaning a pistol and sitting near Larry.

                          SWEDE
               You should watch what you eat.

                          LARRY
               Who the fuck died and appointed you food
               czar?

                          SWEDE
               I'm just worried about your health,
               Larry.  You could stand to shed a few
               pounds.

                          LARRY
                   (sensitive about his weight)
               And you could stand to get a little
               smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde
               fuck?

                          SWEDE
                   (sensitive about the dumb
                    blonde thing)
               Who you calling dumb, dickless?

     Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches
     for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the
     same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN
     swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping
     him to the floor.  Larry's mouth drops open in surprise, but
     it's too late: Deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then
     rabbit punches him in the back of the neck, driving him to
     the ground.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (standing above them)
               Next one of you fuckers plays this game
               I'm going to do for you myself.  I won't
               say it again: we don't have time for this
               shit!  There's a clock running on this
               job, gentlemen, and I mean to be on
               schedule.

     A TENSE MOMENT as Deirdre stares down at these tough guys --
     letting them know who's in charge.  A SOUND from OFF SCREEN
     interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent,
     who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat.

     He's been out somewhere, and he looks first at the squabbling
     men, and then at - Deirdre.  She gives Vincent a little nod --
     a silent command that makes Vincent turn to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               Let's go for a ride.

     Vincent and Sam start off, moving towards the door, while Swede
     and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground.

                          SAM
               Where to?

                          VINCENT
               To see a man about a thing.

                          SAM
               I can do that.

     EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - SUNSET

     A DESOLATE URBAN LANDSCAPE - Sam and Vincent walking away
     from the warehouse, which is housed in what looks to be the
     toughest neighborhood in the city, filled with CHEAP CONCRETE
     PUBLIC HOUSING and INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.

     THE SETTING SUN throws a red glow on the street, giving the
     raw concrete buildings a blood-colored tint, as Sam and
     Vincent approach a FIAT, a car neither too old nor too new.
     Before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by
     FOUR TOUGHS, young guys in their early twenties.  The LEADER
     of the Toughs apporaches Vincent.

                          LEADER
                   (subtitled French)
               Who gave you permission to park here?

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's he saying?

                          VINCENT
               Pretty much what you'd expect.

                          SAM
                   (with a sigh)
               That's what I thought.

                          LEADER
                   (in French)
               There's a charge for parking on our
               block.

     The other Toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in French,
     of course).

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               He says this is their block.

                          SAM
               As in, they own it?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that...

                          SAM
               And I suppose he's saying that we oughta
               give them something for using it, huh?

                          VINCENT
               I didn't know that you spoke French.

                          SAM
               I don't.  But the language he's speaking
               is universal.

     ANGLE ON THE LEADER - Who's smirking at Vincent and Sam.
     Sam's words make a great deal of sense: the Leader is
     speaking the universal language of "give me some money or
     I'll kick your ass."

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I guess we oughta give them something...

     CUT BACK TO: Vincent and Sam.

                          VINCENT
               If you think we should.

     Vincent backfists the Leader in the nose -- hitting him so
     hard that the Leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then
     sits down on his ass.  This blow hurt, but the real damage is
     to the Leader's pride.  Now - One of the Toughs rushes at
     Sam, only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw
     which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him.

                          SAM
                   (as if it were an accident)
               Oh man, I am sorry about that...
                   (he sticks his hand out)
               Let me give you a hand.

     Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough, who ignores the
     hand and totters to his feet.  As soon as he's up he turns
     and runs away, followed by the other Toughs.  Now only the
     leader is left behind.  He looks for a second at Vincent and
     Sam, and then turns and runs after his friends.  Vincent
     calls after him in French, but whatever he says isn't
     translated.  Vincent turns to unlock the car.

                          SAM
               What'd you say to him?

                          VINCENT
               I asked if we could give him anything
               else.

     By now the two men are in the car, which starts up and drives
     off, as it does we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE FIAT - SAME TIME

                          VINCENT
               That was a nice move you did on our young
               friend.  Judo?

                          SAM
               Jujitsu.

                          VINCENT
               Same thing, isn't it?

                          SAM
               Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.

                          VINCENT
               What's the difference?

                          SAM
               One's a lot more painful than the other.

     Vincent laughs, and Sam looks out the window at the city of
     Paris as we MOVE THROUGH to the outside world of -

     EXT. PARIS DRIVING MONTAGE - TWILIGHT

     A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of the car driving through Paris at
     night.  We don't see familiar sights like the Eiffel Tower or
     the Arc de Triomph, but instead - We travel through the LEFT
     BANK, down a series of Mazy Alleys which twist and turn,
     filled with bistros, bars and falafel joints.  NEON SIGNS
     line the streets for as far as the eye can see.  Near the end
     of this trip we hear the SOUND OF A MATCH FLARING, followed
     by -

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Could I get one of those?

     INT. THE CAR - STILL DRIVING - SAME TIME

     Vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette.  He tosses his
     pack to Sam, but he seems a little surprised at Sam's
     request.

                          VINCENT
               Help yourself.
                   (quick beat)
               Since when do you smoke?

                          SAM
                   (lighting up)
               I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a
               week.

                          VINCENT
               A cigarette?  As in one?
                   (exasperated, almost to
                    himself)
               One cigarette a week, who smokes like
               that?

                          SAM
               I do.

                          VINCENT
               Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day,
               and I tell myself I could be worse.
                   (takes a satisfying drag)
               It's just so damned pleasurable.

                          SAM
                   (blowing a smoke ring with
                    great skill)
               It has it's moments.
                   (stubs out cigarette)
               Course, you get cancer and die, that's
               the down side.

                          VINCENT
                   (with a sigh)
               There is that.

     Vincent stamps his cigarette out, looking vaguely unhappy
     that Sam has spoiled his smoke.

                          SAM
               So, Vincent: why bring me along for the
               ride?  Job like this calls for a warm
               body, somebody who can stand around and
               look threatening.  A tough guy.

                          VINCENT
               Like Larry or Swede.

                          SAM
               Exactly.  Why not bring them?

                          VINCENT
               Let's just say I thought the
               conversational possibilities were
               limited.  Of course, I might have brought
               Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right
               candidate -- for this.

                          SAM
               Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for
               sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's
               smart, Gregor is.

                          VINCENT
               So is the woman.

                          SAM
               Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously
               goddamned dangerous.

                          VINCENT
               I wonder if she truly left the IRA.

                          SAM
               I've wondered that myself.  None of this
               answers my question, though...
                   (suddenly direct)
               Why bring me?

                          VINCENT
               I wanted to see who you were.

                          SAM
               Who am I?

     Vincent, driving all the while, gives Sam a sideways glance
     before speaking.

                          VINCENT
               You were once some kind of special
               forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy
               SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for
               the CIA in some place like El Salvador or
               Afghanistan, a real mercenary.
                   (beat)
               Only now -- now you're like the rest of
               us, it's a very competitive market since
               the end of the cold war.  There's a lot
               of hired guns out here, and not nearly
               enough work to go around.

                          SAM
               That's right: there's not hardly enough
               work these days, nothing that pays the
               big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this
               job, paying so much goddamned money I
               couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's
               paying through the nose for this.

                          VINCENT
               They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're
               going to steal, it must be quite
               something.

                          SAM
               Whatever it is it must be goddamned
               priceless.

     And on that thought we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT

     The Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out.
     Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to -

     AN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a
     kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere.
     When Sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath.

                          VINCENT
               Lovely, isn't it?

                          SAM
               They'd have to keep something like this
               under lock and key in New York, and it
               would still get fucked up.

     The two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the
     public.  Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost
     invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced
     tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.  Vincent and Sam
     draw near.  This next conversation between Francois and
     Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          FRANCOIS
               That's good right where you are, Vincent.

     Vincent signals for Sam to stop.  Both Vincent and Sam are
     still several feet away from Francois.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have it?

                          FRANCOIS
               Not so fast.
                   (nods slightly to Sam)
               Who's that?

                          VINCENT
               He's company.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (as if he recognizes Sam)
               Bad company...

                          VINCENT
               What do you mean?

                          FRANCOIS
               He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's
               a cop and you better shoot him in the
               fucking head right now!

     Sam hasn't said a word -- he doesn't seem to understand
     what's been said, but he has noted the urgency with which
     Francois spoke.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT.  Neither Vincent
     nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam.  Instead they
     wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois
     said.  The conversation now switches to ENGLISH, which (it
     turns out) Francois speaks fairly well.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               I just wanted to see something.

                          SAM
                   (that edge creeping into his
                    voice)
               See what?

     Vincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing Francois
     chimes in.

                          FRANCOIS
               He wanted to see how you reacted when I
               said that you were a cop.

                          SAM
                   (he can't believe this)
               You told him I was a cop?

                          FRANCOIS
               He asked me to say it.

                          SAM
                   (looking at Vincent, truly
                    pissed)
               He asked you to?

                          VINCENT
               I needed to know.

                          SAM
               You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (to Vincent, in subtitled
                    French)
               Are you ready?

     Francois's French words give Sam pause -- he's wondering
     what's being said, as - Vincent moves towards Francois,
     leaving Sam several steps away.  The conversation is again in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH.

                          VINCENT
                   (taking out an envelope)
               Here's yours.

                          FRANCOIS
               There's been a slight problem.

                          VINCENT
                   (immediately tensing)
               What's that?

     Francois gives the slightest of nods, indicating that Vincent
     should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away -
     A COPSE OF TREES, where we see a SNIPER pointed a telescopic
     rifle at Vincent.

                          FRANCOIS
                   (still in subtitled French)
               If you say a word in English, Vincent, my
               friend with the high powered sporting
               rifle will shoot you in the throat.
               Sorry to screw you over like this, but
               the information you want might get me
               killed if I give it to you, and that's a
               price I'm not willing to pay.

                          VINCENT
                   (in French)
               I take it you still want the money...

                          FRANCOIS
                   (in English, with a grin)
               Of course.

     SAM'S POV: Looking at Vincent and Francois.

     The men are talking, and from here we can't really hear them
     speak.  All Sam can see is an earnest Vincent listening to
     Francois talk, almost as if Francois is giving Vincent
     instructions.  Now - Vincent reaches into his pocket,
     reaching for the envelope of cash he's carrying.  As he hands
     the money to Francois, Vincent uses his free hand to pull out
     his gun while - Sam already has his gun out -- somehow he
     figured out what was going on -- and now Francois looks on in
     stunned disbelief as -

     Sam fires a single shot, hitting Francois in the shoulder,
     driving him away from - Vincent, who now squeezes off several
     rapid fire shots at the sniper, while - Francois, bleeding
     but still very much alive, now has his piece free just as -
     The Sniper, his gun firing wildly into the air, falls to the
     ground, shot dead by Vincent, and now - Francois is drawing a
     bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of
     bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING
     flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground,
     spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY
     SILENCE FALLS, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
     dies.  Vincent and Sam look at one another, see that they're
     still alive, and then look back at - The two men they've
     shot.  Francois isn't quite dead.  Blood bubbles from his
     lips as Vincent leans over him.  Again, they speak in
     SUBTITLED FRENCH

                          VINCENT
               Where's my information?

                          FRANCOIS
                   (with a grim smile, pointing to
                    his head)
               In here...

                          VINCENT
               Then you better find it in your heart to
               tell me, Francois, because while your
               death is inevitable, it still isn't
               decided how painful it's going to be.

     A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francois's ear, whose grin
     blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him.  Francois
     whispers something back and then - BANG.  Vincent shoots
     Francois in the head, killing him instantly.  Then Vincent
     bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which Francois
     had tucked inside his shirt.  As Vincent does this, Sam comes
     up from behind.

                          SAM
               Now would be a good time to get the fuck
               out of here.

     INT. THE FIAT - LATER/NIGHT

     The two men drive in silence for a moment.  Vincent lights a
     cigarette and offers one to Sam, who refuses.  Finally, Sam
     speaks.

                          SAM
               You know, what you pulled back there,
               that was bullshit.

                          VINCENT
               I needed to see if you were a cop.
                   (defensively)
               I'm a popular man with the police, Sam,
               and whenever they try to catch me they
               always do it with an inside guy -- some
               man on some job who seems more
               trustworthy than all the others put
               together.  And that's the guy you have to
               watch out for.
                   (beat)
               I hate cops...

                          SAM
                   (insulted that Vincent would
                    even consider it)
               Well I ain't a cop.

     A BEAT, the two men driving in silence.

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          SAM
               Know what?

                          VINCENT
               That there was a gun pointed at me.

                          SAM
               I saw you look off when Francois nodded
               his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing
               out a particularly rare shrub, and the
               rest was easy.

                          VINCENT
               But how did you know I would have the
               presence of mind to pull my weapon
               when I did?

                          SAM
                   (as if it's obvious)
               Because that's what I would have done...

     CUT TO:

     EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER/NIGHT

     Vincent's Fiat is parked at the curb in front of this
     apartment house.  Vincent and Sam exit the car and move
     towards the house -- a silence hanging between them.  Right
     before they go into the house, Vincent takes out the envelope
     full of cash that was supposed to have been for Francois.  He
     thinks for a moment and then hands the whole envelope to Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You saved my life back there in the park.
               I know this doesn't begin to make it
               right between us...

     Vincent's voice trails off -- he doesn't know what to say.
     Sam takes the money out of the envelope -- half he keeps for
     himself, the other he gives to Vincent.

                          SAM
               What I did back in the park I did because
               we're working together -- we're on the
               same team.
                   (holding up the money)
               This is business -- this is work.  We did
               it together, we share the spoils, even
               split.

     Sam opens the door to the house, but Vincent has one last
     thing to say to him.

                          VINCENT
               I owe you a heavy debt.

     Sam almost smiles cynically at this: debts of honor don't
     seem to be something he believes in.

                          SAM
               Whatever you say.

     They enter the house and the door closes behind them.  A
     second later we hear -

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               What'd you do with the money?

     INT. THE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

     Vincent and Sam sit with Deirdre in a room, alone.  They've
     told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about
     all of this.

                          VINCENT
               We kept it...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (a little annoyed)
               Is that right?

                          SAM
               Hazard pay...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with an exhalation of disgust)
               The two of you were supposed to go to a
               simple meet and come back with a simple
               piece of information, and instead you
               went to fucking war...

                          SAM
               We weren't real thrilled about it
               either...

     Deirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises.  We FOLLOW HER
     INTO -

     AN ADJOINING ROOM -

     Where Larry, Swede and Gregor are waiting.  They look up
     expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without
     stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events.

                          LARRY
               So what's the deal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (barely stopping, very
                    snappish)
               The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice
               at first light.

     And she exits, leaving these three men behind along with Sam
     and Vincent, who have entered from the other room.  larry
     looks at the two of them.

                          LARRY
               What'd you guys do?

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     A CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.  Inside sits our friend, the
     WATCHER.  Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again
     he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he
     watches the House.  It's dark -- a single light glows behind
     a window on the third floor.  Sam's room.

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to
     do a martial arts form.  Right now he's frozen, one leg
     extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg.  Now - A
     KNOCK at his door -- seconds later, it opens.  Deirdre stands
     there, watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more,
     and then retracts his leg.

                          DEIRDRE
               I feel as if I've wandered onto the set
               of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me
               to do that?

                          SAM
               I didn't think to see you again tonight.
               You were pretty pissed.

                          DEIRDRE
               I still am.

                          SAM
               Is that right?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's right.

     Deirdre spings at Sam, throwing martial arts combinations at
     him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm
     thrust.  Sam parries her blows as she drives him across the
     floor until he's got his back to the wall.  Their movements
     are controlled, but powerful, and there's something almost
     flirtatious about the whole thing.  Now -

     Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.  He slips
     behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.  The
     previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed
     exercise, but now - They spar for real -- they never hit one
     another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whizzing
     through the air, throwing rapid-fire combinations and
     techniques.  They're not angry, but they're not kidding,
     either.  Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts
     Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her
     punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted at
     all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches
     her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground
     and now - She's trapped beneath him.  The two of them are
     breathing hard from the exertion, their faces close to one
     another, shining with sweat and excitement and - We've gone
     from flirting to an almost primal seduction, and with their
     faces only inches apart Deirdre leans in to kiss Sam, and
     he's about to meet her half way when he pulls back.

                          SAM
               Part of me says I should just look at
               this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But
               then I remember you're you -- Deirdre
               who used to belong to the IRA -- and it
               occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge
               come very naturally to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (kissing him very lightly)
               Nobody's saying they don't.

                          SAM
                   (returning the kiss, just as
                    lightly)
               And when I consider that, I have to
               wonder if you don't have some ulterior
               motive for being here, with me, right
               now.

                          DEIRDRE
               I probably do.
                   (pulling him close)
               But for the time being, I'm willing to
               forget about it...

     They finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and
     as they start to make love the

     CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING, floor by floor, until
     we've reached -

     EXT. A ROOFTOP GARDEN - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre and Sam are not the only ones indulging in
     extracurricular activities.  Up here in this rooftop garden
     we find Swede and Gregor talking in hushed tones.

                          GREGOR
               I would imagine that the great
               satisfaction in all of this will be
               killing the American.

                          SWEDE
                   (we know this isn't true)
               I hadn't thought about it.  Understand
               me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in
               killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit,
               but I don't get off on it.

                          GREGOR
               A means to an end, is that it?

                          SWEDE
               That's it.

                          GREGOR
                   (he rises to leave)
               Then I guess we're set.

                          SWEDE
               There is one other thing...

                          GREGOR
               What's that?

     Suddenly Swede pulls Gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh
     THUD.  Within seconds he has his gun pressed to Gregor's
     head.

                          GREGOR
               What are you doing?

                          SWEDE
               Don't cross me...

                          GREGOR
               Nobody's going to do that!

                          SWEDE
               Really?

                          GREGOR
                   (truly frightened)
               I need you, Swede, I can't do this
               without you!

                          SWEDE
                   (beat, then he puts his gun
                    away)
               I just wanted to make sure you knew who
               you were dealing with.

                          GREGOR
               I do, I do...

     Swede is now on his feet, walking away, back into the
     apartment house.

                          SWEDE
                   (this is almost to himself)
               Just remember it, then.

     And he's gone.  And as soon as he is, we notice something
     strange about Gregor: he's not the least bit scared -- he
     laughs a little low laugh as we - 

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE HOUSE - DAWN

     GRAY LIGHT seeps in from the horizon, while inside in -

     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME

     Deirdre is pulling her dress over her head.  Sam seems to be
     sleeping in his bed as she moves like a cat towards the door
     when -

     Sam's HAND reaches out, gently yet firmly, and takes her by
     the arm.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               No goodbye?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake --
     looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance.

                          DEIRDRE
               Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way
               when I tell you we won't be doing this
               again.

                          SAM
               You don't have to explain yourself to me,
               Deirdre.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (almost surprised by this)
               I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just
               that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -
                   (almost with a sneer)
               Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with
               any man it was deemed necessary for me to
               sleep with.  You know: any man who needed
               setting up.  Sometimes so we might
               blackmail him, sometimes so he could be
               killed.
                   (a quick beat)
               Sometimes so I could kill him myself.
               IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist
               organization, Sam.  To most of the men I
               with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl
               to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of
               it."  "Have the girl fuck him."
                   (a quick beat)
               But I look at you and I get this feeling
               you take me for what I am: no more, no
               less.

                          SAM
               You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like
               me.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be
               with someone who was just like me.

     Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the
     bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam.
     They're lips brush and -

     A MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room, breaking the moment.  A
     QUICK BEAT, then -

                          DEIRDRE
               I better be getting that.

                          SAM
               Duty calls?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a trace of a sigh)
               Just business.

     Deirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens
     his door.  The muted phone is a little louder now.  Deirdre
     closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand
     and catches the door right before it snaps shut.  He watches
     THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and
     opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly
     until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting
     Sam out.  The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as
     this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go
     to - BLACK.  Just for a second.  And then - BLINDING SUN hits
     us in the eyes as we find ourselves above -

     EXT. NICE - DAY

     A DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT, establishing that we've
     changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue
     water and reflective surfaces: the Cote d'Azure.  We start to
     MOVE DOWN TOWARDS -

     EXT. A PRIVATE BEACH - NICE - MEANWHILE

     A TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays,
     sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER.
     Nearby -

     AT A ROUND TABLE -

     A nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we
     find our group: Deirdre, Sam, Vincent, Gregor, Swede, and
     Larry.  Food and drink surround them.  Larry is, of couse,
     still eating.

                          DEIRDRE
               Now then, let's run through it one more
               time, shall we?
                   (to Gregor)
               What's your job?

                          GREGOR
               I use my cell phone to get computer
               access to the telecommunications
               satellite used by our target.  I trace
               his cell phone signature and use it to
               pin point his location as he moves
               through Nice, relaying that information
               to you.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Larry)
               Next.

                          LARRY
                   (a sigh, he's done this too
                    many times)
               You call me with the target's route, I
               follow along until we've reached the
               attack point and then I run his squag ass
               off the road.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Swede)
               Which leads us to...

                          SWEDE
               I ride with fat-boy...

                          LARRY
                   (under his breath)
               Eat shit and die slowly...

                          SWEDE
               After we stop the target car I get out
               and use the heavy artillery to kill the
               driver and his bodyguard.

                          LARRY
               I blast the lead car into oblivion...

                          VINCENT
                   (picking up)
               While Sam and I take out the back two
               cars...

                          DEIRDRE
               Leaving...

                          SWEDE
                   (picking it up)
               ...Leaving me to step in, drop the target
               in the back seat, and get the package...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a quick look at Sam)
               While...

                          SAM
                   (returning her look)
               ...While I back him up, making sure to
               get the package if something goes wrong
               and somebody takes Swede down.

     Nobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we
     should -- if only to note that there's something about the
     way Deirdre queries Sam about his role, and something about
     the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- they're
     not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the
     history they now have between them.  But -- nobody else
     notices, and Swede's line follows Sam's without breaking the
     flow of the dialogue.

                          SWEDE
               Nobody's taking me anywhere...

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          LARRY
               Then Swede and I split with the package
               and meet you back at the rendezvous.

                          DEIRDRE
               And then...

                          VINCENT
               And then Sam, you and I clean up
               whatever's left to be cleaned.

                          DEIRDRE
               Very good.  Now all we have to do is live
               long enough to get paid.

     EXT. A POSH HOTEL - LATER - NIGHT

     A ROW OF ROOMS, each one with a light behind a shade.  Even
     as we watch the light in each room goes off: one two three
     four five six lights -- one for each member of the team.  The
     night before the big event nobody breaks curfew.

     ACROSS THE STREET -

     A BAR -

     Through the bar window we see the Watcher's silhouette.  A
     match flares as the Watcher lights a cigarette, REVEALING his
     face for the first time: weathered, sharp, treacherous.  THE
     MATCH goes out, and the Watcher's face FADES TO BLACK, and so
     do we.

     FADE IN ON:

     EXT. THE HILLS OF NICE - MORNING

     A PRIVATE ESTATE IN THE HILLS -

     A CARAVAN OF BLACK ARMOR PLATED CARS, all idling, ready to
     pull out, filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under
     their jackets, all of them waiting for - THE TARGET.  Except
     we've seem him before and he wasn't called the Target: he was
     the Killer from the first scene of the film: the gunman in
     the cathedral who made off with -  THE BRIEFCASE.  Which the
     briefcase is still handcuffed to his side.  Now the Target
     gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in
     the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell
     phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does
     we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as
     we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and -

     THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the
     length of the town adjacent to the beach.  It's a special
     place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for
     tourists.  Here we come upon -

     AN OUTDOOR CAFE -

     Where we find Deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a
     HEADSET.  And, lest we think she looks out of place, we get
     a look at -

     THE REST OF THE CAFE -

     Where many of the other PATRONS are typing away on laptops,
     or chattering like crazy on their cell phone.  She types a
     sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out
     loud.

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright, Gregor, I'm...

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CRAMPED COMPTUER CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME

                          GREGOR
                   (finishing her sentence)
               Ready when you are...

     Gregor is sitting behind a console, looking at Deirdre's
     message, which we can read on his laptop.  Gregor also has a
     much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we
     see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.  This is a map of
     incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice.
     Now - THE MAP starts to shift, randomly moving about the city
     as it searches for the proper signal.  The computer isolates
     an entire district of the city, enlarges a part of the
     district, and then locates and enlarges a single street.  Now
     - On screen a FLASHING CURSOR appears on the map, the TARGET.
     The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and
     as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR,
     driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the
     Target.  THE JAPANESE DRUMS we heard in the opening sequence
     start to play again -- softly, ominously, and we're on -

     EXT. A SIDE STREET

     Where VINCENT'S FIAT is parked at a curb, Sam and Vincent
     sitting inside.

     INT. THE FIAT

     Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him,
     loading a small arsenal of weapons.

     The DRUMS grow, a little louder now, a little more urgent.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET

     A VOLVO idles, waiting for something, Larry behind the wheel
     of this car, and sitting next to him Swede.  The DRUMS
     continue to play, and their volume is still low, but they're
     jarring, setting our nerves on edge.

     INT. THE VOLVO

                          LARRY
               Where is this broad?

                          SWEDE
               You should learn a little patience.

                          LARRY
               Is that right?

                          SWEDE
               It's consider a virtue in some corners
               of the world.

                          LARRY
               Not in mine.

     THE CAR PHONE rings, and Swede pushes a button.  Deirdre's
     Voice is heard on the speaker phone.

                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)
               Hello gentlemen, are we ready?

     EXT. THE CAFE

     Deirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregor's instructions.
     She speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary
     business -- as if she's giving someone traffic directs
     over the phone.  The JAPANESE DRUMS continue, quiet and yet
     intense.

                          DEIRDRE
               You want to take a left, then, so that
               you're going west.

     During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play,
     building with the action as we do -

     THE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS -

     The Volvo takes a flying left turn -

     Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards
     the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his
     keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a
     bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as -
     The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does
     the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -

     THE CARAVAN of cars -

     THE TARGET CAR -

     THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE
     COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map
     shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now -

     The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build
     to a crescendo as -

     The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind
     together, as -

     CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat,
     which forces them to slam to a halt, as -

     Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS
     stop.

     Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a
     MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast
     of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing
     against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet-
     proof.  The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the
     heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.

     Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing
     away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them,
     pouring out of Cars 3 & 4.  These guys are armed and returning
     fire as -

     Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's
     got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER,
     which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as
     it scorches the air, traveling towards -

     The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized
     what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive
     back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the
     Car sideways.

     Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other
     Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a
     team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until
     it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
     one.

     And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray,
     firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's
     side so that Sam can run towards -

     The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat,
     pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death
     himself as -

     Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
     monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack
     and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a
     bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.

     Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who
     is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of
     the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires,
     winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and
     still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits
     Swede with the Briefcase.

                          THE TARGET
               Fuck you!

                          SWEDE
               Not today.

     BANG.  Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending
     his life.  Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the
     two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.  With one slashing
     blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs
     the briefcase.  The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the
     handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.  Now -
     DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back
     towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the
     briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to
     Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who
     have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the
     SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW
     MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent
     are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they
     don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire
     time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by
     any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his
     side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry
     and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks
     back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam
     screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because -
     Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the
     protective covering of his bullet proof vest.  Now we're
     MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup
     piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots
     into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way
     Larry shot the target in the warehouse.  Swede is sent flying
     backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.  For a second we
     think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just
     as Sam predicted.  Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
     too wears a bullet proof vest.  By now - Larry has rolled out
     of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now -
     Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him.

                          SWEDE
               I don't particularly like killing, tubby,
               but I want you to know that this one I'm
               going to enjoy.

                          LARRY
                   (sees something over Swede's
                    shoulder)
               I don't think so.

     Swede turns to follow Larry's gaze, and as he does - Gregor
     walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swede's chin.
     Before Swede can even compute this, Gregor pulls the trigger,
     firing straight up into Swede's brain.  Then, without even
     looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground -
     Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo, driving
     off just as - Sam arrives, kneeling down by Larry.  The SIRENS
     get louder.

                          LARRY
                   (in shock)
               He just...I don't believe that son-of-
               a...

     Vincent's Fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them,
     Vincent and Deirdre inside it as Sam manages to get Larry
     into the back seat.  Sam doesn't get in the car yet as Larry
     says -

                          LARRY
                   (still having trouble believing
                    it)
               We've been crossed...

     The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive,
     charging with automatic weapons drawn.  Between the French
     cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car,
     and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls
     it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops
     have just reached.  Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting
     off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to
     the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.  We start to SLOWLY
     PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the
     shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking
     hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street.

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE OLD CITY/NICE - SUNSET

     The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets
     in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old
     City a coppery red.

     We're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and
     turns of what an American would call back alleys but that
     pass for streets in this place.  It is quiet almost deserted,
     then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car
     through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE
     DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a
     back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.
     Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we
     PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear -

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               What is this?

     INT. A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     A SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.  Sam is tending to
     Larry's wound.  Sam seems to know what he's doing, as Larry
     is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make-
     shift stand.

                          SAM
                   (answering Larry's question)
               It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut
               with a little crank because we might need
               you awake in the real near future.

                          LARRY
               Fine with fucking me, we got work to do.
               I don't care what it takes, we are
               getting our property back and putting it
               into the hands of the people who are
               gonna pay us a great deal of money when
               we do.  I don't know about the rest of you
               guys, but I'm not the kind of guy
               to just sit back and take it in the ass.
                   (a quick beat)
               I don't mean that in, like, a literal
               way...

                          DEIRDRE
               Of course.

                          VINCENT
               Finding this package is a thing easier
               said than done.  We don't even know what
               it is.
                   (he looks at Deirdre, and
                    suddenly he's deadly earnest)
               What did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly defensive)
               I don't know.

                          VINCENT
               When this whole thing started you made it
               clear: you're running the show.  And I
               don't believe you'd be running this show
               if you didn't know what was going on.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well I don't!

                          VINCENT
               And I don't believe you...

     Vincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at Deirdre's
     head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as
     well, jammed into his stomach.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (suddenly feral) 
               You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but
               you'll be dead before I hit the ground.

                          VINCENT
                   (matching her intensity)
               I don't want you dead, woman, I want the
               the truth!

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (with a dead cool in his voice)
               Both of you...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun -
     an interesting moment, because he can shoot either Deirdre or
     Vincent, but not both at the same time.  The question is:
     whose side is he on?

                          SAM
                   (continuing without missing a
                    beat)
               ...put your guns down and chill out.

     A BEAT.  And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons,
     followed by Sam.

                          SAM
               Like it or now, we're on the same side:
               we're here and the package isn't.
                   (looks at Deirdre)
               You're not the boss any more, you're our
               partner.  So tell us what you know, so we
               can figure a way out of this mess.

     Sam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust
     based upon their physical intimacy.

                          SAM
               Now, what did we steal?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she hates to admit this)
               I don't know...
                   (defensively, off Vincent's
                    look)
               Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery
               to me just like it is to you.
                   (quick beat, then reluctantly
                    continuing)
               But I do know who we're working for.  My
               people, and the Russian mob.

                          LARRY
               Your people?  Who the fuck is your
               people?

                          VINCENT
               Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you believed me?
                   (passionately)
               But it wasn't my people who did it.

                          LARRY
               How do we know that?

                          SAM
               Because if they had she'd be gone along
               with the package, instead of sitting here
               with us.

                          DEIRDRE
               Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's
               man.  It was my people came up with the
               idea for this run, but the Russians who
               had the capital to finance it.  Gregor,
               he was their insurance, and I was ours.
               Everybody else was supposed to be
               neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...

                          LARRY
               I never did trust that blonde fuck...

                          DEIRDRE
               That's why you were riding with him.

                          VINCENT
               The question still remains: what do we do
               now?

                          SAM
                   (he figures something out)
               Gregor's cell phone...

                          LARRY
                   (to himself)
               What are you gonna do, call him up and
               ask him to give us back our shit?

                          SAM
                   (ignoring Larry, to Deirdre)
               Did he bring that with him?

                          DEIRDRE
               I bought it for him -- all the stuff he
               was using, it was in his contract.  Cost
               a nice penny, too, especially that
               goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive
               tastes.

                          SAM
               Check this out.
                   (he's thinking on his feet)
               Gregor's a spook, or he was one until
               recently.  When he was a spy he lived the
               life -- you know, a prince in some
               Eastern Bloc country where nobody had
               shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the
               wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And
               Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no
               special stores with Western food and
               video tapes.  I would bet dollars against
               shit that Gregor liked that phone and he
               doesn't want to give it up.  And I
               wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant
               enough to think...

                          DEIRDRE
                   (finishing his sentence)
               That we're too stupid to trace his calls.

     Deirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles
     as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they
     might still win this one.

     EXT. AIX EN PROVENCE - TWILIGHT

     We're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France:
     the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix.

     Outdoor cafes line the sides of the street, while a canopy of
     interlocking trees covers everything.  Now we're - MOVING,
     DOWN THE STREET, towards a CAFE, where a DAPPER GENT sits,
     sipping a mineral water.  The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet.
     Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in
     neutral.  The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and
     gets up, crossing to - The Jeep.  A door opens, and the
     Dapper Gent, carrying his satchel, gets into the jeep, which
     drives off as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute, down
     the length of the Cours Mirabeau.

                          GREGOR
                   (breaking the silence)
               It's a beautiful street, no?

     The Dapper Gent also has an accent, a much thicker one than
     Gregor's; it's an accent that places the Gent as a resident
     of what used to be called the Soviet Union.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (he can't wait any longer)
               Do you have it?

                          GREGOR
               Always in a rush, you are.  All these
               years I've known you, you could never
               wait for anything.

                          DAPPER GENT
               This is important.

                          GREGOR
               Do you really think so?

                          DAPPER GENT
               You know it is.

     Gregor, still driving, takes out a SILENCED PISTOL, and the
     Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece.

                          GREGOR
               Relax!

     The Dapper Gent loweres his hand, leaving his gun in his coat.
     Gregor pulls the van to a curb.

                          GREGOR
               Look over there.

     GREGOR & THE GENT'S POV: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF
     CHILDREN are playing.

                          GREGOR (O.S.)
               Do you see that one?  The girl in the
               light blue dress?

     We find one particular LITTLE GIRL, around eight, holding the
     end of a jump rope, wearing a light blue dress.  She's
     breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his
     silenced pistol, as if to shoot her.

                          DAPPER GENT
               What are you doing, have you lost your
               mind?!?

     Gregor pulls the trigger, as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs
     his arm, and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot
     just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark, harmlessly
     shooting into a tree, causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the
     ground behind the playing children.  Nobody notices a thing.
     BEAT.  The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken, because there is no
     doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent
     hadn't ruined his aim.

                          DAPPER GENT
               Why did you do that?

                          GREGOR
               To make a point.  I don't know her, and I
               was ready to splatter her brains all over
               the sidewalk.
                   (giving the Gent a look)
               I don't particularly like you, so imagine
               what I'll do if you try anything...

     Gregor leaves his gun dangling in the air a moment longer than
     necessary and then starts the jeep as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE OF AIX - NIGHT

     A FULL MOON casts a silver light over a field of wild grass.
     A soft wind blows, and the grass moves gently from side to
     side.  Now - Gregor's JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE
     THROUGH TO -

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (squirming)
               Enough!  We've been driving for an hour,
               where is my package?

     Gregor smiles -- he's been waiting for this.  He pulls the
     jeep over and looks at the Dapper Gent.

                          GREGOR
               It's under your seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
                   (incredulous)
               What?

                          GREGOR
               As my American friend Larry would say:
               are you fucking deaf?  It's under your
               seat.

     The Dapper Gent looks down, and sure enough, the edge of the
     Briefcase sticks out beneath the seat.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I can't believe you'd do that, Gregor.  I
               thought I trained you better than that.

     With a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor,
     whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward.
     He can't help himself, he opens the satchel and there it is -
     COLD HARD CASH in large bills, enough for Gregor to live like
     a prince for quite some time.  Gregor sucks in an involuntary
     breath and then looks back up to see - The Dapper Gent hasn't
     reached for the Briefcase.  Instead he's taken out his gun,
     and it's only inches from Gregor's head.

                          DAPPER GENT
               I've never particularly liked you either,
               Gregor.

     The Dapper Gent yanks out the Briefcase, and as he does -

     THE SEVERED HAND comes whipping out along with it, still
     attached by the handcuff chain.  The Hand flies up in the
     Dapper Gent's face, and we notice that the Hand is starting
     to rot -- it's bloated and swelling and horrific and it
     scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent, who drops his gun and
     fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFT...we hear the sound
     of another silenced shot as we -

     SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     A DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of
     the jeep.  Seconds later - The door swings open, and the
     Dapper Gent's body plunks out onto the ground.  A moment
     later, something wet and viscous plops down on the face of
     the Gent as the jeep drives off.  Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT on
     the Dapper Gent's dead body, which lies in the silver
     moonlight, blood running out from beneath him, while the
     Severed Hand palms the Gent's face, fingers splayed out
     around his head.  Now - We HEAR the sound of PHONE TONES.
     And not just any phone...

     INT. THE JEEP - SAME TIME

     Gregor finishes punching a number into his CELL PHONE.  We
     hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is
     picked up.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Is it done?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               It's done.

     BEAT.  The Phone Voice doesn't respond for a moment -- whoever
     this is they didn't expect to hear from Gregor.  The Voice
     switches to English.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               Gregor, is that you?

                          GREGOR
                   (with a low chuckle)
               Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               It was a mistake, it shouldn't have
               happened.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly cold, furious)
               I'm in the middle of saving you people a
               great deal of money -- the least you
               could do is have the decency to pay me!

     BEAT.

                          PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
               So what do we do?

                          GREGOR
               What I do is none of your concern.  What
               you should do is wait for my next phone
               call.  I'm going to find a place where I
               can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm
               ready, I'll call you and tell you what I
               want you to do.

     The Phone Voice says something unintelligible in Russian, cut
     off by Gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE CHEAP APARTMENT - DAWN

     Larry snores on the couch, while Deirdre sleeps in a sleeping
     bag on the floor.  Vincent sits in a ratty easy chair, feet
     propped on an overturned crate, dozing lightly.  Suddenly -
     Vincent's eyes open, warily, as if something has changed in
     the room.  He looks around - No Sam.  Vincent gets up, takes
     out his gun, and silently gets to his feet.  He moves down a
     long hall and - No Sam.  Now, like a cat, Vincent moves into -

     THE BATHROOM: pitch black.  He moves in, swipes the string of
     the overhead light and - nothing.  Nobody's here.  The only
     place left is the front door, and now Vincent approaches.  He
     opens the door, gun still at ready, and moves out into -

     INT. THE LANDING OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

     This is a small building.  There is no other apartment on
     the floor.  At the far end of the landing, there is a small
     ladder which leads up to -

     THE ROOF.  And the door which leads to the roof is flapping
     in a light wind.

     EXT. THE ROOF - SAME TIME

     Vincent bursts onto the roof, gun straight out, finger on the
     trigger, only to find - Sam is there, his gun pointed at
     Vincent.  A BEAT, then both men give little laughs and put
     their weapons away, like Samurai so trained in combat that
     they know when it's safe to relax.

                          SAM
               What's going on?

                          VINCENT
               You weren't around when I woke up, I
               thought maybe something had happened.
                   (off Sam's look)
               This has been one very fucked up job,
               Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances
               on anybody...
                   (a quick beat)
               Including you...

     In answer Sam takes out Vincent's pack of cigarettes and
     tosses them back to him.  Vincent looks almost delighted at
     this.

                          SAM
               I came up here to sneak a smoke.

                          VINCENT
               You were smoking?

                          SAM
               I hope you don't mind I took your pack.
               It was on the table.

                          VINCENT
                   (very sincere, offering the
                    pack)
               Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many
               you'd like.

     Sam considers for a minute, and then takes one.  Vincent does
     so as well, and he searches for his lighter, which he can't
     seem to find, because - Sam has it, and he lights their
     cigarettes, and then hands the lighter back to Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (a shrug of the shoulders)
               I borrowed that, too...

                          VINCENT
                   (puffing contentedly)
               Of course...whenever you feel like it
               just help yourself.

                          SAM
               I have a feeling I'm about to start
               buying my own.

     BEAT.  The two men smoke in silence, looking out at -

     THE CURVED SHORELINE OF NICE -

     Which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment
     buildings, and a thousand more from the cars that travel on
     the road that leads into town: the Promenade des Anglais.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               That was a bad bit of business, today.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
               It was at that.

                          VINCENT
               A lot of people died.

                          SAM
               I've seen a lot of people die before.

                          VINCENT
               I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you
               get used to it?

                          SAM
               You don't.  You just learn to live with
               it.

                          VINCENT
               I won't lie -- there have been times when
               I had to do it, times when the only way
               to get out alive was to see that the
               other man didn't.

                          SAM
               We live in a singular world, my friend.

                          VINCENT
               I never really thought I was part of the
               world you move in, Sam, to tell you the
               truth.
                   (off his look)
               I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small
               time king of way.  To the local police
               I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a
               legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just
               another two bit hired gun.

                          SAM
               You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I
               got a feeling you cost more than two
               bits.

     This conversation might have gone further, but it is
     interrupted when Deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof.

                          DEIRDRE
               Christ, I was starting to think that the
               two of you had thrown it in and walked
               away.
                   (to Vincent)
               There's someone on the phone downstairs
               asking for you, and my somewhat limited
               French leads me to believe that he might
               have something to tell us about Gregor.

     EXT. THE HIGHWAY - LATER - NIGHT

     A car we haven't seen before, a CITROEN, hums up the French
     highway in the night, along on the road.  It's a postcard
     moment, but only for a moment.

                          LARRY (V.O.)
               I'm telling you...

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

                          LARRY
                   (continuing)
               That I could be dead and I'd drive better
               than you.

     Deirdre is driving, and Larry -- much to his chagrin -- is in
     the passenger seat, watching her every move.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (very curt)
               Oh shut up...

     IN THE BACK SEAT -

     Sam and Vincent have a MAP spread out.  Vincent is tracing
     Gregor's route so far, and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as
     it traces a line up the highway.

                          VINCENT
               He's going north.
                   (circles something on map)
               That's Aix en Provence, where he used the
               phone.

     Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the
     map.  Destination: Paris.

                          SAM
                   (making up his mind)
               He's going back.

                          VINCENT
               Not necessarily.  He could go off road at
               any number of places.  He might not even
               be in the country anymore.

                          SAM
               It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for
               anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he
               doesn't waste time on this road unless he
               has to be on it in the first place.
               Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by
               now.  He's going to Paris.
                   (beat)
               Now I just hope we can find him before he
               gets there.

                          DEIRDRE
               If somebody else doesn't find him first.

     EXT. THE TOWN OF ORANGE - DAY

     Orange, pronounced "Au-Ronge", is a mid-sized town of fifty
     thousand souls.  It is small, charming, quaint, and it has
     one particular thing that no other town in France can claim -

     AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly
     restored.  We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we
     MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE.
     It's packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled
     with a tourist having breakfast.  This normally quiet place
     explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally
     famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater.  We come
     upon -

     A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS: a Family.  Dad is angry at Mom.

                          DAD
               Opera?  This is an opera festival?

                          MOM
               I told you that, Henry.

                          DAD
               I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera.
               You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that
               kind of thing.

     Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them
     behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a
     cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.  Here, in the most
     removed table in the entire Square, we find Gregor sitting in
     the shadow of the trellis.  Unless you're on top of him you
     can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly.  His cell
     phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and
     starts to punch in a number.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A REST STOP ON THE HIGHWAY - MEANWHILE

     THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars.  Sam is
     sleeping in the back seat, while Vincent is seen on an
     outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot.
     Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating French
     fast food, which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH
     OF THE TABLE, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages
     with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes.

     In fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the
     imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry
     can't contain himself.  He's stuffing himself, washing
     everything down with the wine which is also sold at these
     road-side rest stops.  Deirdre drinks coffee.

                          LARRY
                   (mouth full)
               This...this is incredible. Is the rest
               of Europe like this?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with a laugh)
               Some places, not all.  Italy, for
               instance, they're serious about their
               food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere
               in the U.K., you don't get much fancier
               than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not
               our thing, you see.

                          LARRY
               What is?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (everybody knows this)
               Best beer in the world known to man or
               God.

                          LARRY
                   (with a snort)
               Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for
               me, thanks.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (with unconcealed scorn)
               Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and
               you've the unbridled gall to mention
               Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's
               not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor
               excuse for rabbit piss.

                          LARRY
               Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?

                          DEIRDRE
               I drink what every civilized man, woman
               and child in the world drinks: Guinness.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               I hate to interrupt a conversation of
               such cultural depth...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent -

     Who has finished his phone call and returned to join them.

                          VINCENT
               ...but we've got to get back on the road.

     Vincent raps lightly on the car window next to Sam's head --
     Sam's eyes shoot open: a light sleeper.  All eyes are on
     Vincent, who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news.

                          VINCENT
               We've got him.

                          LARRY
               I'm driving.

     EXT. THE TOWN SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Gregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table
     in the corner cafe.  He's been here for hours, observing the
     Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking
     for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music,
     have entered the Square -- everything about these guys
     screams GUNMEN.  Now, as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN
     comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope.  The
     Gunmen look around the Square, trying to see where Gregor is,
     but he's too far back in the shadows.  The Gunmen ask the
     Teen a question, to which the Teen can only shrug his
     shoulders.  Now - The Teen walks away, leaving the Gunmen to
     open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly
     read.  From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching
     in a number on his cell phone.  Simultaneously, the Gunmen
     finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them, and
     turn around to face - A PAY PHONE.  The phone rings, and one
     of the Gunmen goes to pick it up.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - MEANWHILE

     The Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl, cruising
     the streets, looking for Gregor.

     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

     Vincent stares out of the window and sees something that
     causes him to swear under his breath in French.  It's -

     The Gunmen walking down the street.

                          VINCENT
               I know those men.

     Sam frowns: he also seems to recognize at least one of the
     gunmen.  None of the others in the car notice Sam's reaction,
     but we do.  The Gunmen are heading straight for -

     EXT. THE ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman
     Theater.  The theater itself is almost two thousand year
     old.  A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a
     massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its
     kind in the world.  THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the
     theater, holding ticket stubs.  They are with a Tour Group
     led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French.  As
     the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall, the Gunmen hang
     back and then separate from the crowd.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - SAME TIME

     THE CITROEN sits at a curb.  Larry sits behind the wheel of
     the car, the getaway driver with the motor running.  Vincent
     and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater.  Sam
     stays behind for a second to say something to Larry.

                          SAM
               Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when
               your partners come back out, you make
               sure you're here with the motor running.

     And on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre.
     Larry doesn't notice it, but - THE WATCHER has found them.
     He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard
     and hugging the shadows of back alley.  Cradled in one hand,
     barely visible but ominously present: his knife, which for
     one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. INSIDE THE ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

     The Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum-
     like staircase.  Behind them we can see the Tour Group,
     standing on the stage, being lectured to by the Ancient
     Geezer.  In front of them the Gunmen find -

     AN EXIT which leads to an interior hall.  Inside the exit
     it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen.  They
     look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice
     come at them from out of the dark.

                          GREGOR (V.O.)
               Thank you, gentleman, that will do
               nicely.

     IN THE HALL -

     ON GREGOR.  It's dark in here.  There are no lights, no
     torches.  From the dark in here, he can look out and see -
     THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by
     the sun.  Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES,
     and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can
     see his quarry, but they can't see him.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard, is that you?

     EDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen
     responds.

                          EDVARD
               Yes, Gregor, they sent me.

                          GREGOR
               I'm touched, really, that they'd send
               someone of your caliber.  It's nice to
               know that they didn't make the mistake of
               underestimating me twice.

                          EDVARD
               That was a mistake, trying to kill you.
               Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd
               have never allowed it.

                          GREGOR
               I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's
               too late for trust: we have a serious
               problem.

                               EDVARD
               We'll double your price.

                          GREGOR
                   (now that's interesting)
               Really?  Do you have the money with you?

                          EDVARD
               Do you have the material?

                          GREGOR
               You first, Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Perhaps we could both go at the same
               time...

                          GREGOR
                   (a short laugh)
               I think not.
                   (with a flourish)
               After you...

     A GUN COMES INTO FRAME, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to
     Gregor's temple.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               After you, asshole.

     Gregor stiffens, as we PULL BACK ON Sam, who has snuck up on
     Gregor and gotten the drop on him.

                          SAM
               You might have been one mean technical
               spook, Gregor, but you wouldn't have
               lasted a week in the field.

     CUT TO THE GUNMEN'S POV: Looking into the Tunnel - It's dark,
     they can't see a thing, but they've heard Sam's voice and
     they know something's wrong.

                          EDVARD
               Gregor, are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Gregor's fine...

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Deirdre -

     She's snuck up on the Gunmen, weapon drawn.

                          DEIDRE
                   (continuing)
               ...but I think you're in a bit of
               trouble.

     The Gunmen reach for their pieces and as they do -

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Don't even think it.

     CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent - And his piece is also out --
     the Gunmen are trapped, and they know it.  Now we notice that
     - The Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards
     us.  Meanwhile, back in -

     THE TUNNEL -

     Sam is grilling Gregor furiously, his gun still to Gregor's
     head.

                          SAM
               Don't talk to me unless you tell me what
               I want to hear, understand?!?  You have
               no choice in this, don't think about
               winning, think about staying alive.  I
               want the item, and if you don't give it
               to me, I'm gonna kill you.

                          GREGOR
                   (a panicky hiss)
               I don't have it with me...

                          SAM
               Bullshit!

                          GREGOR
               I swear...

                          SAM
               Then where is it?

                          GREGOR
               I sent it to myself in Paris.

                          SAM
               Sent it where?

                          GREGOR
               A post office box.

     Suddenly Gregor runs forward, towards the exit.  Sam runs
     after him, tackling him just as they reach - THE OUTSIDE,
     where the two men roll into plain sight of - The Gunmen, who
     are still covered by Vincent and Deirdre.  Now we notice -
     That the Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are really close,
     no more than ten yards away, as - Sam has Gregor pinned face
     first on the ancient stone of the theater.  He looks up at
     the others, and that's when it happens - Edvard looks at Sam
     and recognizes him.

                          EDVARD
                   (stunned, announcing to the
                    group)
               Do you know who he is?  He's with
               Interpol, the Internation Police.  He's
               a cop.

     A SLOW MOTION BEAT.

     Vincent and Deirdre don't know what to make of this, their
     heads turn to look at Sam, and in this instant - The Tour
     Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for
     his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman, and with
     the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME, as -
     The Crowd panics, screaming, and now Edvard is reaching for
     his weapon, as - Sam shoots again, killing the 2nd Gunman,
     and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as -
     Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as -

     Deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into
     the tunnel.  Now we go -

     OUTSIDE THE THEATER -

     Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn, but
     he's been ordered to stay in the car.  In frustration he
     slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry,
     the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as
     we go back -

     INTO THE THEATER -

     Edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many
     Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of
     them, including the Dad we saw earlier.  Seconds later,
     Edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now - Vincent and
     Sam meet in the middle of the crowd.  There is time for a
     QUICK BEAT, while Vincent glares at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I
               should kill you.

                          SAM
               But you can't.

     And now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving
     Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow
     Sam into -

     THE TUNNELS -

     It's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena.
     Except that everything here is made of stone and the only
     light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit
     openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide
     just barely enough light for us to see.  Now we do a SERIES
     OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while -
     Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a
     dead end.  He turns around, looking for a way out as - Gregor
     sees the final exit ahead of him as we go -

     OUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the
     Citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that -
     The Watches is almost on him, and now we're back -

     IN THE TUNNELS -

     Deirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost
     reached the exit as -

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     Gregor hits the street running.  He doesn't notice the
     Citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but
     as he runs by -

     The car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it.
     He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured.
     Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in.  It's the
     Watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one:
     SEAMUS REILLY.  Seated in the front seat is - A very dead
     Larry.  Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Gregor, with an Irish
                    accent)
               If you want to live you'll do exactly as
               I tell you.

     THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears, exiting the
     theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to -

     INT. THE TUNNELS - SAME TIME

     Vincent, gun drawn, moves warily down one of the tunnels.
     Outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren.
     Vincent turns a corner and - A GUN jams itself into his face.
     It's Edvard.

                          EDVARD
               Where do I know you from?

                          VINCENT
               Vienna.

                          EDVARD
               Of course...I remember.  I quite liked
               you, I'm sorry to have to do this.

     Edvard's finger tightens around the trigger, when -

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Hey...

     Edvard is startled by the sound of Sam's voice.  Even as he
     squeezes off the shot, Edvard turns to look at Sam, and as he
     does so, Vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot
     awry, causing it to - RICOCHET wildly, whining around the
     room, until it - Rips through Sam's side, a nasty wound but
     not fatal, as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but it's
     too late, because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head
     that kills Edvard.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - MEANWHILE

     Deirdre has reached the Citroen.  She looks in and sees
     Seamus and Gregor.  Lastly she looks at the dead Larry.  She
     sighs in disgust, but otherwise doesn't react as if
     surprised.

                          DEIRDRE
               Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch
               would have sufficed, Seamus, don't you
               think?

     SCANT SECOND LATER -

     Larry's body hits the street as the Citroen drives off,
     Deirdre behind the wheel just as - Sam and Vincent run out of
     the theater, with Vincent helping a wounded Sam who bleeds
     from the wound in his side.  They arrive at the street only
     to see - Larry, lying dead in the street, even as the Citroen
     speeds away from them, turning the corner before they can
     even think to raise their guns.

                          VINCENT
               That double-crossing bitch.

     Sam isn't even capable of saying that much -- he just stares
     after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any
     we've seen in the film: "how the hell did that happen?"  But
     there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by
     - A COP.  He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts
     drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless,
     holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he
     stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're
     both pointed at the Cop.  LONG BEAT.  In the way off distance,
     another siren can just be heard.  Sam and Vincent glare at
     the Cop, who strains with all his might to control himself,
     but he can't because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be
     served.  The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his
     mind.  Two.  One.  The Cop puts his gun on the ground and
     steps back, raising his hands in the air.  Now - Sam and
     Vincent stumble into the street, and are instantly almost hit
     by - A CAR speeding around the corner, its Driver oblivious
     to what's going on.  The car screeches to a halt, and the
     Driver curses loudly in French.  And then the next thing the
     Driver knows - A Gun is in his face.  The door is yanked open
     and the Driver is yanked out, as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A BACK ROAD - LATER/EARLY EVENING

     The town of Orange is just visible below us as the
     commandeered Car drives up into the hills.  Vincent is behind
     the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat.
     Gritting his teeth, Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at
     - THE WOUND, and it's small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a
     small raw hole in Sam's side.  The wound bleeds, but
     moderately so -- no major organs or arteries have been hit.

                          VINCENT
               That makes twice now you've saved my
               life.

                          SAM
               I didn't save your life back there.
               Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save
               shit.

                          VINCENT
               You see it your way, I'll see it mine.
               You need a doctor.

                          SAM
                   (hopeful)
               You know one around here?  Somebody you
               trust?

                          VINCENT
               No...I thought I'd take you to the
               hospital.

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I
               have to.

                          VINCENT
                   (he can't believe this)
               Fix it yourself?
                   (a thought comes to him)
               Why are we even doing this?  There's no
               need to run, Christ...
                   (he can't disguise his disgust)
               You're a cop.

                          SAM
               Not exactly.

                          VINCENT
               You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.

                          SAM
               If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have
               busted you a long time ago.  This isn't
               about you, it's about the job I have to
               do.

                          VINCENT
               And what job is that?

                          SAM
               My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to
               know about.  I can't go to the local cops
               -- they'd never be able to get close
               enough at this point.  It's me or nobody,
               and I've been on this job too goddamned
               long not to finish.

     BEAT.  Sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes, offers one
     to Vincent and takes another for himself.  They smoke for a
     second, before Vincent speaks.

                          VINCENT
               It looks to me like we're all that's left
               of our group.

                          SAM
               We?  There is no we in my world now,
               Vincent, just me.

                          VINCENT
               I'm going with you.

                          SAM
               This doesn't involve you, don't you
               understand?  I can't even guarantee you
               any money out of all this.

                          VINCENT
               It isn't about money for me, not
               anymore.

                          SAM
               You don't have to do this.

                          VINCENT
                   (with great finality)
               Yes I do.

     Sam gives Vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief --
     Vincent's loyalty and sense of honor is something he's never
     seen before, and Sam can only smoke in silence and consider
     this as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. A CHEAP BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A PEEPHOLE slides open, and we look through it into -

     INT. AN ADJOINING ROOM

     where Gregor sits, bound and gagged in a chair, his eyes wide
     with fright.  Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre
     turns to face Seamus Reilly.

                          DEIRDRE
               When we're done with this, I want to do
               for that one myself.

                          SEAMUS
               Now there's the Deirdre I know.

                          DEIRDRE
               And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus
               Reilly?

                          SEAMUS
               It means I was worried that all the time
               you spent away from the fold might have
               affected you.  You've been living the
               life of the hired gun -- the well paid
               hired gun, I might note.  There's no
               glory to it, but there are those that
               like it.

                          DEIRDRE
               So you thought that maybe I'd grown too
               attached to this charade I've been
               playing, is that it?

                          SEAMUS
               It's been known to happen.

                          DEIRDRE
               Not to me, you know that.

                          SEAMUS
                   (goading her)
               I thought I did.

     Seamus's taunt works: Deirdre whips out her gun and puts it
     to his head.

                          DEIRDRE
               I guess you don't know me, then, if you
               think I won't kill you for an insult like
               that!

     Seamus glares at Deirdre for a moment, and she glares back at
     him until he starts to laugh.

                          SEAMUS
               Just testing, lass.  Forgive me, but I
               had to do it.

     Deirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun.

                          DEIRDRE
               Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when
               we get home, I don't play "the girl"
               again.

     Deirdre gives Seamus a look to make sure this last point is
     clear and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A FARMHOUSE - THE COUNTRY - NIGHT

     The Stolen Car parks behind a BARN, and Sam and Vincent get
     out.  Waiting for them is a friend of Vincent's - JEAN-
     PIERRE, a Frenchman in his forties, hearty, burly, friendly.

                          VINCENT
               Hello, Jean-Pierre.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Hello, my friend.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

                          SAM
               American.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we
               see what we can do for you?

     INT. THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - LATER/NIGHT

     SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS - Are laid out on a clean cloth.
     Scalpel, forceps, a clamp, a sponge, medical thread and
     needles.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Sam, stretched out on the
     kitchen table.  Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre,
     who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sam's wound.
     Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see what's
     going on.  Sam, with his medical training, is treating
     himself.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               It's right there, beneath the surface.  I
               can just make it out.

     Sam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus
     on what's going on so that he can talk Vincent through this
     next procedure.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Are you sure you won't have a drink?

                          SAM
                   (sharply)
               No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the
               mind I can control.
                   (quick beat)
               Alright, let's do it.

     During this next sequence, we CUT BACK AND FORTH between
     Sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where
     he's watching.

                          SAM
               Douse the wound with alcohol.

     Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the
     wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his
     central nervous system.

                          SAM
                   (to Jean-Pierre)
               Take that sponge and wipe away as much of
               the blood as you can, keep it clean so I
               can see.

     Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that
     keeps filling the wound.  Throughout the procedure Jean-
     Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he
     squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the
     floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               Take the clamp...

     Vincent picks up the clamp.

                          SAM
               Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.

     Vincent attaches the clamp to Sam's wound.  It takes perhaps
     fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing
     for Sam.  He sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the
     smallest of grunts.  But he doesn't move.  Finally Vincent is
     done.

                          VINCENT
               Alright, it's done.

                          SAM
               You see the bullet?

                          VINCENT
               Clearly.

                          SAM
               Good.  Now take the forceps, and
               remember, Vincent, what we're doing here
               is routine.  I've done stuff like this at
               least twenty times in the field.  There
               are no vital organs where you're working,
               no major muscles or arteries -- you can't
               kill me.  Just make sure you've got the
               bullet before you try to pull it out.

     Vincent probes the wound with the forceps.  This takes
     probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the
     clamp was attached.

     Several times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his
     grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips - Sam makes the
     smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain.
     Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a
     single tug, Vincent extracts it.

                          VINCENT
                   (holding the bullet aloft)
               A souvenir...

     He tosses the bullet through the air, and we FOLLOW IT IN
     SLOW MOTION as it lands in - A SAUCER, which sits on the
     kitchen counter.  We're back in REAL TIME, as the bullet
     rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt.
     Now - Sam breathes the hugest of sighs, and his face relaxes.
     Instantly, Vincent puts a lighted cigarette in Sam's mouth,
     and he drags deeply on it.

                          SAM
                   (to Vincent)
               You think you can stitch me up on you
               own?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

                          SAM
               Then if you don't mind...
                   (he hands the cigarette back to
                    Vincent)
               I'm gonna pass out.

     And that's exactly what he does.

     A TIME CUT TO:

     INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Vincent and Jean-Pierre sit on easy chairs.  An open bottle
     of wine sits between them, a FIRE burns in the fireplace, and
     they smoke in a contented silence for a moment.  When they
     speak, it is in FRENCH, with ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               He's tough, your American friend.

                          VINCENT
               Yes, Sam's tough alright.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               And you respect him.

                          VINCENT
               Of course.  Don't you?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I've never seen a man who could have
               taken what he just went through.
                   (beat)
               He's a cop?

                          VINCENT
                   (beat, trying to find a way to
                    say it)
               Not exactly.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?
                   (beat)
               So he saved your life, then?

                          VINCENT
               How did you know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in
               his head a long time ago.

     Both men stare back into the fireplace and we HOLD FOR A BEAT
     before we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THE FARM - KITCHEN - DAWN

     Sam is awake.  Pale from the loss of blood, he moves softly
     around the kitchen, searching professionally for something,
     giving the moment a slightly dangerous feel because he seems
     so intent on what he's doing and then he finds it - THE
     COFFEE.

     TEN MINUTES LATER -

     A stream of Hot Coffee migles with a stream of Steamed Milk.

     EXT. THE FARMHOUSE PORCH - SUNRISE

     A STEAMING CUT OF COFFEE sits in Sam's hands as he lights a
     cigarette to go with the coffee.  He sits on an ancient
     chair, smoking in silence, looking out at - THE WOODS around
     the house, and this place is postcard-beautiful, the French
     Farmhouse you see only in pictures.  But Sam's mind is
     elsewhere, he's staring into space, lost in thought.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               You're feeling better?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Jean-Pierre stands in the open front door of
     the farmhouse, with a cup of coffee.  Now, Jean-Pierre moves
     out to join Sam, sitting down on another chair opposite him.

                          SAM
                   (responding to the question)
               Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for
               now.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
                   (pointing at Sam's wounded
                    side)
               You should really let a doctor look at
               that.

                          SAM
               Soon.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               But first you have something to take care
               of?

                          SAM
               Yeah.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Something important?  A thing that cannot
               wait?

                          SAM
               It gets done now or not at all.  Another
               couple of days and the parties concerned are
               gone where I can't get them.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Forgive my intrusion into your affairs,
               but I am the one who connected Vincent to
               this job, his agent, if you will.  He is
               one of my oldest friends and I owe him a
               great debt, much like the debt I suspect
               he owes you.

     A QUICK CUT TO:

     INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

     Where Vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit
     a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from
     outside.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               Vincent doesn't owe me a thing.

     Vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards
     the sound of the voices.

                          JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
               He sees this differently, as you well
               know.

                          SAM (O.S.)
               I didn't expect that he would.

     BACK ON THE PORCH -

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You suffered through an agonizing pain
               last night, pain you could have avoided
               by declaring yourself an agent of the
               law.

                          SAM
               Vincent told you that I'm a cop?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal
               would have the extensive military and
               medical expertise you do.  And so I place
               the pieces of the puzzle together in a
               way that makes sense to me.  You work for
               some government agency and you carry a
               gun, and in my world, that makes you a
               cop.

     And now Jean-Pierre produces a LONG BARRELED REVOLVER which
     he places loosely in his lap -- a gesture which seems to say,
     "you'd better explain things to my satifaction or we're
     gonna have a problem."  Sam notices the weapon, but he
     doesn't react overtly.

                          SAM
               So this is what, a test?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Call it a reckoning of character.

     BEAT.  Sam looks at the Revolver again.

                          SAM
               If I was healthy, I could take that away
               from you.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if
               you try I'll kill you.

     QUICK CUT TO: Vincent - Who stands inside the house, out of
     sight, but not out of ear shot.  He's listening to
     everything, and we notice that Vincent has taken out his
     own gun.

     BACK ON Jean-Pierre and Sam.  By now Jean-Pierre has raised
     the pistol.  He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks
     the hammer.

                          SAM
               So what is it you want to know?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               I suppose I want to know how a man like
               you is created.

                          SAM
               Created?

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like
               steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern
               Samurai.  I've spent my life around
               extraordinary men -- men like Vincent.
               But I've never seen anyone like you.
                   (beat)
               I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes
               with you.

                          SAM
               Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll
               have to carry it for himself.  And I'm
               not any kind of Samurai.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               You seem one to me.

                          SAM
               A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by
               the code of Bushido, the way of the
               warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.
                   (beat)
               The world isn't about honor, anymore.
               It's about survival.

     LONG BEAT.  Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre.
     He relaxes his finger on the hammer.

                          JEAN-PIERRE
               Survival.  I suppose that's as good a
               cause as any.

     BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun. BACK ON
     Sam and Jean-Pierre - And we're PULLING BACK, AWAY from the
     Farmhouse, which glows in the morning sun as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - DAY

     A BLACK COMPACT CAR sits in front of a Parisian Post Office.
     Inside the car, behind the wheel, we see Deirdre.  Now,
     coming out of the Post Office, we see - Gregor and Seamus
     Reilly.  Seamus has a coat slung over his arm, hiding the gun
     which he keeps pressed to Gregor's side.  There's no sign of
     the Briefcase as Seamus and Gregor get into -

     INT. THE CAR - SAM TIME

     THUNK!  The door slams shut.  Gregor and Seamus are in the
     back seat.  Almost instantly Seamus angrily snaps a pair of
     handcuffs on Gregor.  Immediately, Deirdre pulls out.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where's the case?

                          GREGOR
                   (nervous)
               There's a problem...

                          SEAMUS
                   (jumping all over him)
               Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to
               me, and if you are you're a dead man!

                          DEIRDRE
               Would somebody tell me what fucking well
               happened in there?

                          SEAMUS
                   (disgusted)
               Nothing.

                          GREGOR
                   (eager to explain)
               The package didn't come.  I'm sure it
               will tomorrow.

     Suddenly Seamus seems to lose it.  He grabs Gregor and slams
     a gun against his head.

                          SEAMUS
                   (he's almost foaming at the
                    mouth)
               If you're lying to me you poor excuse for
               a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains
               all over this car.

                          GREGOR
                   (beyond desperate)
               I swear, it has to come here!  It has
               to...

     BEAT.  For one tension-filled moment, we think Seamus is
     going to splash Gregor's brains all over the place.  But then
     he smiles, puts his weapon away, and pats Gregor gently on
     the face.

                          SEAMUS
               Ease up, man...I'm just checking to make
               sure you're on the level.

     Gregor is beyond speech -- he can only whimper.

                          SEAMUS
               And it seems to me I saw a sign in there
               that says they got a late afternoon
               delivery.  Why don't we come back later
               today and do this all over again, huh?

     Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit
     sadistic.  Neither Gregor nor Deirdre smiles in return as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - PARIS - DAY

     THE EIFFEL TOWER fills our eyes.  And then we PULL BACK TO
     REVEAL that it's a tacky, flyblown poster on a dingy street.
     And now we're -

     MOVING DOWN the Street, until we come to a store whose sign
     advertises in English - HONG KONG MOVIES.  The windows of the
     store are filled with posters.  We MOVE THROUGH TO

     INT. THE STORE - SAME TIME

     TONY SIMON, an expatriate black American, runs this place and
     lives above it.  His shelves are lined with action films made
     in the Far East.  Tony knows everything there is to know
     about the films he sells -- but he also knows quite a bit
     about what's going on in the Parisian Underworld.  he's a
     professional information broker.  Right now he's talking to a
     CUSTOMER in perfect French, with English Subtitles.

                          TONY
               Hey, man, they're both great movies.  One
               is more of a character study, the other
               is more of a straight action thing, but
               they're great movies, and he's an amazing
               fucking filmmaker.

     Tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention.

                          TONY
               Excuse me...

     Vincent and Sam have entered the store.  Sam's ability to be
     back on his feet in such a short time is amazing -- but we
     can see that he's not the same guy he was at the start of the
     film.  what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of
     will.  Now - Tony moves to join them, and the conversation
     immediately turns to English.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent)
               My man, how you doing?

                          VINCENT
               I'm alright.  And you?

                          TONY
               Doing well.
                   (with a look at Sam)
               This is?

                          VINCENT
               A friend.  I was telling him about how
               you always have the latest tapes.

                          TONY
               Why don't we step into my office...

     Tony's office, it turns out, is the area behind the COUNTER.
     Tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get
     to the other side, and then he closes it behind him.

                          TONY
               So what can I do for you?

     Vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking.  The
     place is empty except for - The single Customer Tony was just
     talking to.  The Customer is still considering the two films
     Tony was showing him.

                          VINCENT
               I was wondering if you had any movies
               that were particularly new.

                          TONY
               Matter of face there's this flick I've
               been hearing about.  I haven't seen it,
               but from what I hear it's pretty cool.

                          SAM
               What's the story?

                          TONY
               It's an international thing.  Several
               different peoples involved, criminals
               from all over the world, experts brought
               together to do a job.  But maybe the most
               interesting thing about it is that
               preeminent in the plot we find the
               Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together.
               An unlikely group of partners.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have the tape?

                          TONY
               I might know where you could get a copy.

     The Customer approaches the counter.  He has both tapes with
     him.

                          TONY
                   (to Vincent and Sam)
               Let me do some business with my boy here,
               and I'll meet you across the street in
               five.  I gotta make homes here feel like
               he's getting a good deal while I give him
               the pleasure of overpaying me for a
               couple of second generation pirates.

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     The Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a
     great fucking deal he just got!  A few seconds later, Tony
     comes out and locks up the store front.  He crosses the
     street towards -

     INT. A FALAFEL JOINT - A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT

     A HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end.
     We PULL BACK ON - Tony, who's just taken a bite out of the
     falafel.  He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and
     Sam.

                          TONY
                   (his mouth full)
               What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of
               talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of
               it at first, cause, like I said, the
               Irish and the Russians are an unlikely
               mix.

                          VINCENT
               You said you might know where we can get
               a copy of this tape?

                          TONY
               All depends on whether you want the
               Russian or the Gaelic language version.

                          SAM
                   (instantly)
               Gaelic.

                          TONY
               You sure?

                          SAM
               I'm sure.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Tony)
               Can you get it?

                          TONY
               The Russian would be easier.

                          SAM
               Why's that?

                          TONY
               Cause the Russian production company
               would be easier to find.

                          SAM
               It's the Irish tape we want.

                          TONY
                   (with a sigh)
               Gonna be tough.

     Tony scribbles something on a piece of paper.

                          TONY
               Last I heard there was a film rep for the
               Irish players staying at this address,
               name of Seamus Reilly.

                          SAM
                   (repeating it, he knows this
                    name)
               Seamus Reilly.

                          VINCENT
                   (to Sam)
               You know him?

                          SAM
               I know of him.

                          TONY
               Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish
               Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his
               more moderate filmmaking brethren have
               turned to making movies for peace-loving
               pussies, if you see what I'm saying.

                          VINCENT
               I get the picture.

     Sam reaches for the piece of paper, but Vincent puts his hand
     on top of it.

                          VINCENT
               Tony and I have to talk some business,
               first.

                          TONY
               I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to
               moan about the price, we settle somewhere
               in the middle.

                          VINCENT
               It's a matter of respect.
                   (to Sam)
               Why don't you wait outside, this won't
               take long.

     Sam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards
     the exit.  Behind him in rapid-fire French, Tony and Vincent
     are now discussing the price of the information.  They are
     both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying
     themselves immensely.

     EXT. THE FALAFEL SHOP - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     Vincent exits the shop and gets into -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT

     Where Sam sits in the passenger seat as Vincent slides behind
     the wheel.  Vincent tosses Sam a piece of paper.

                          SAM
               The Irish representative?

                          VINCENT
               Yes.

     Vincent gives Sam another piece of paper.

                          SAM
               What's this?

                          VINCENT
               The address of the Russian production
               company.  Just in case we need to find
               them.

                          SAM
               Thorough man.

     Vincent starts the car and we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. A PARIS STREET - LATER - AFTERNOON

     The Peugeot sits, parked at a cub, a discreet distance from -
     AN APARTMENT HOUSE: 35 Rue de Glacon.  We PUSH IN on the -

     INT. THE PEUGEOT - LATE AFTERNOON

     A PIECE OF PAPER scarwled with the same address: 35 de
     Glacon.  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL -

     Sam, holding this paper and looking out at the apartment
     complex.

                          SAM
               You sure your friend got the right place?

                          VINCENT
               If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

     BEAT.  Vincent wants to know something important.

                          VINCENT
               Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?

                          SAM
               Do what?

                          VINCENT
               Continue when it would be so much easier
               to give it up.

                          SAM
               It's my job.

                          VINCENT
               Then quit.
                   (beat)
               You don't work for Interpol, Sam.

                          SAM
               Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the
               guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard
               said.

                          VINCENT
               It's a cover, then.  A cover within a
               cover, a feint within a feint.
                   (quick beat)
               You work for the CIA, it's the only
               possible answer.

     LONG BEAT.  Sam considers what to say, and then decides he
     owes Vincent the truth.

                          SAM
               I'm a field agent -- last of an already
               extinct breed.  I do dark ops.

                          VINCENT
               Dark ops?

                          SAM
               Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping.
               Assassination.

                          VINCENT
               Very ugly.

                          SAM
               It is at that.

                          VINCENT
               Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much
               the modern Samurai after all.

                          SAM
               I never made that claim.

                          VINCENT
               I know.  Jean-Pierre did.

                          SAM
               You were behind the door?

                          VINCENT
               I was waiting to see what would happen.
               I didn't want to kill him if I didn't
               have to.

                          SAM
               You would have done that?

                          VINCENT
               I would have tried not to.  But yes, if
               it would have kept him from shooting you,
               I would have.

                          SAM
                   (almost to himself)
               How could you have done that?

                          VINCENT
               Because I owe you.
                   (he sees something)
               Look at that...

     THEIR POV: Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits the
     apartment building.

                          SAM (O.S.)
                   (quietly exultant)
               All things come to those who wait.

     Now Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
                   (really surprised by this)
               He's not dead.

     BACK ON Sam and Vincent.

                          SAM
                   (figuring it out)
               They don't have the package.

                          VINCENT
               You think?

                          SAM
               You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.
               If they had the package, they'd have
               killed him.

     Vincent and Sam exchange a look -- now they both figure it
     out.

                          VINCENT & SAM
                   (simultaneously)
               They're going to get it.

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE POST OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

     A HAND signs a receipt, and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at
     a counter, signing for his package, which slides across the
     counter.  It's the Briefcase, although it's been wrapped in
     BROWN PAPER for its journey through the French Postal System.
     Now we see that - Seamus is still right beside Gregor; is, in
     face, almost on top of him, with a hand in his coat pocket
     which lets us know where his gun is.  Now - The two men start
     to move towards the exit as we -

     CUT TO:

     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - A MINUTE LATER/LATE AFTERNOON

     The Black Compact Car idles at a nearby curb, with Deirdre
     behind the wheel.  She's staring so intently at the front of
     the post office, that she's surprised when a SHADOW falls
     across her.  She looks up to see - Sam, standing next to the
     car.  Deirdre starts to reach for her weapon, but Sam cuts
     her off with a word.

                          SAM
               Don't do it...

     Something in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she
     backs off.  Now she and Sam exchange a long look.

                          DEIRDRE
               Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.
                   (she really sounds betrayed)
               I can't believe I misjudged you like I
               did.

                          SAM
               Oh please..you're on some sort of holy
               mission?

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm a patriate.

                          SAM
               Don't even think that I'm buying that.

                          DEIRDRE
               Where do you get off saying word one?
               All the time pretending to be one of us,
               it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus
               and myself.  And here you are so high and
               mighty, like you're so different from the
               rest of us.

                          SAM
               I didn't say I was.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (she sees something)
               Bloody fucking hell...

     CUT AWAY TO: Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post office.
     By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor.
     Unseen by these two men - Vincent is approaching from the
     side, on an intercept course, his hand inside a bag which he
     carries with him.  Now - Deirdre turns and shoots Sam a look.
     He's still watching her keenly, and we can see that she's
     aching to reach for her piece, but she can't because Sam is
     still on her like a hawk.

                          SAM
               Don't even think it.

     He pulls back the folds of his suit jacket, revealing his
     gun, putting his hand comfortably on the pistol grip.

                          SAM
               I'd kill you before you had it halfway
               out.

     Vincent is closing on Gregor and Seamus, another ten seconds
     and he'll have them.

     Now - Deirdre looks back at Sam, then back at the situation
     developing in front of her, and then suddenly - She slams the
     car into gear and drives off, tires squealing while - Sam
     pulls his piece, sighting down the barrel and - He can't do
     it, can't shoot Deirdre.  Now - The sound of the car alerts
     Seamus, who turns in time to see - Vincent, who is raising
     the bag wrapped around his hand as - The car flies directly
     at - Vincent, who if forced to jump out of the way even as he
     pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag.  The end
     of the bag explodes in a burst of fire, but the shots are off
     the mark - Missing Seamus and Gregor as - Vincent rolls out
     of the way, just in time, while - Deirdre brakes the car to a
     screaming halt, as Seamus pushes Gregor in ahead of him and
     then gets in.  Seconds later, the car pulls out, even as -
     Sam drives up in the Peugeot to Vincent, who picks himself up
     off the ground and leaps into the car.  The last thing we
     hear is the sound of Sam's Voice as the Peugeot drives off.

                          SAM (V.O.)
               Put your seatbelt on.

     CUT TO:

     INT./EXT. - CAR CHASE MONTAGE

     During this SEQUENCE, we'll JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two cars and
     the streets they travel through.  Now - The Black Compact Car
     flies down a small street, followed closely by - The Peugeot,
     where Sam is driving as Vincent tries to steady his gun to
     get a clear shot at the other Car.

     INSIDE THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               What the fuck happened?

                          SAM
               I don't know...

                          VINCENT
               You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her,
               there was no way out.

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Deirdre is driving for dear life, while Seamus is
     freaking out.

                          SEAMUS
               What in bloody hell is going on?

                          DEIRDRE
               They're part of the team.  One of them's
               the guy I told you about.

                          SEAMUS
               From Interpol?

                          DEIRDRE
               That's him.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Why didn't you kill her?

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               Why didn't you kill him?

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     The two cars SLAM through the traffic, heading for a HIGHWAY
     RAMP which appears now perhaps two blocks away.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (figuring it out)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
               How is it these fellahs managed to get
               the drop on us?

                          DEIRDRE
               I told you: they're good...

     OUT IN THE STREET -

     THE TWO CARS have reached the highway ramp, and as first one,
     and then the other pulls onto the highway, we PULL BACK AND
     UP TO REVEAL:

     THE PERIFERIQUE -

     The massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
     city of Paris.  Right away we notice that this entrance ramp
     leads to a traffic circle, filled with various off ramps
     which lead to no less than four different sections of the
     Periferique.

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
                   (slamming the dashboard in
                    disgust)
               You slept with her!

     IN THE COMPACT -

                          SEAMUS
                   (lecturing Deridre)
               You should have kill him when you had
               the chance.  But no...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               You put everything on the line because
               you...

     IN THE COMPACT

                          SEAMUS
                   (as if finishing Vincent's
                    sentence)
               You slept with the fucker!!

     ON THE PERIFERIQUE -

     THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle,
     while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the
     roadways.

                     VINCENT (O.S.)
          Fuck...

     IN THE PEUGEOT -

                          VINCENT
               Left left left!!!

     Sam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps: one to the
     right, one to the center, and one to the - Left.  At the last
     second he takes the left turn as we go back to -

     IN THE COMPACT CAR -

     Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening
     Gregor.  Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
     the other.

                          SEAMUS
                   (waving the package)
               This better be the real thing or you're a
               dead man!

                          GREGOR
               It is, I'm telling you it is!!

                          SEAMUS
               You've told me a lot of things, boyo...

     ZING-SHATTER!  A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield
     as - The Peugeot is catching up, and Vincent is leaning out
     of his window, firing away.  Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               Lose them!

                          DEIRDRE
               You lose them!

     Deirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the Compact takes a
     screaming turn, followed by - The Peugeot, and now they're
     both speeding towards another junction, where several other
     roadways of the Periferique run together.  Now we see that -
     Seamus is returning Vincent's fire, even as - The Junction
     approaches, and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre.

                          SEAMUS
               To the right!!!

     Deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now
     on an -

     EXIT RAMP, going against heavy traffic.  Now -

     Deirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars,
     but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along,
     and now -

     One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down
     the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt
     as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained
     by their seatbelts.  The car has stalled, and Sam has to
     start her up again and slam it into gear before following
     after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
     yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow
     after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway
     ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL
     BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying
     through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now -
     The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.

                          SAM
               Give me a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
               Right now?

                          SAM
               Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!

                          VINCENT
                   (fumbling with a cigarette)
               Why are you driving?
                   (rapid fire)
               You're not French, you don't live here,
               you don't know these roads.  Why are you
               driving?

     He puts the cigarette in Sam's mouth and as he does - The
     Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on
     the Compact, and now - SCREEEEECCHHH!!!!  About fifteen cars
     pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The
     Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus
     breathes a hugh sigh of relief.

                          SEAMUS
               About time!

                          DEIRDRE
                   (glancing in her mirror) 
               Not yet...

     The Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up, and it's
     back on their tail.

                          SEAMUS
                   (practically tearing his hair)
               Good Christ!  Can't you lose these
               jokers?

                          DEIRDRE
                   (through clenched teeth)
               They're good!

     And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car,
     and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as -
     Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters
     in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see -

     A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed
     off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the
     Compact Car is headed right for it, and now -

     Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact
     Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade
     rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre
     slams on the brakes as -

     Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in
     front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the
     Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
     Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as -
     The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and
     we're in SLOW MOTION as -

     Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but
     there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning
     her, even as -

     Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the
     windshield and flying through the air as -

     The Compact Car flips over and over and over while -

     Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life
     to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before
     the crash, and now -

     Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face
     sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive
     as -

     Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the
     exit ramp as -

     Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car,
     carrying the Briefcase with him, as -

     Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is
     now - On fire, and now -

     Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go
     back, because -

     A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident,
     and it's too late to turn around, and even as -

     Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it -
     EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire -
     Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second,
     even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
     out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to
     pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.

     Now Deirdre pulls Seamus over the side of the embankment,
     right before the cops arrive, and the two of them roll/fall
     almost thirty down a steep incline, even as -

     Sam catches a quick glimpse of -

     Gregor, scurrying away from the highway, carrying the
     Briefcase, and now Sam has to gun his car and get gone,
     because the Cops have reached -

     The Wreck, which is quickly burning itself out, and as the
     Cops look into the debris they see that -

     THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.  Everybody's gone.

     FADE OUT.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               We don't have much time.

     FADE IN ON:

     INT. VINCENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A FRONT DOOR, guarded by about five heavy locks, opens and
     Vincent and Sam enter.  Sam looks around and surveys the
     apartment.

                          SAM
               Nice place.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see the rest of the apartment: there's
     practically nothing here.  A table with a couple of chairs, a
     fridge.  An open door leads to a bedroom with a small, spare
     bed and a nightstand with a cheap lamp.

                          VINCENT
                   (by way of explaining)
               I'm not here very much.

                          SAM
               Business keeps you on the road?

                          VINCENT
               Something like that.

     The two men crass the room towards - A METAL CABINET which is
     tucked into a nook in the wall - VINCENT'S HAND turns a heavy-
     duty COMBINATION LOCK and then: Click, the cabinet opens and
     we see -- WEAPONS.  An endless cache of guns, knives,
     explosives, surveillance devices, gun scopes -- you name it,
     it's here.  Now Vincent's Hands reach into the cabinet and
     start taking out weapons.  We PULL BACK ON -

     Vincent, who gives the weapons to Sam.  Sam checks to make
     sure the weapons are loaded and/or ready for use, and then
     piles them, one on top of the other.

                          SAM
               I know I don't need to say this to you,
               but I need to say it to you.
                   (beat)
               This is my job, I have to do it.

                          VINCENT
               So I do it.

                          SAM
               No you don't, and you know it.

                          VINCENT
               If our positions were reversed, would you
               leave me?

                          SAM
                   (he says this too quickly)
               In a minute.

                          VINCENT
               I think not.

     BEAT.  Sam can't say anything, because he knows that what
     Vincent is saying is true.

                          VINCENT
                   (considering the weapons)
               Do we need anything else?

                          SAM
               Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

     Vincent thinks about this for a seoncd -- and then burst out
     laughing as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. ANOTHER CAR - MEANWHILE/NIGHT

     Deirdre once behind the wheel.  The passenger seat next to
     her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they
     flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror,
     which reveals -

     A glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.  Crashing
     through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever
     changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing
     wounds and burn tissue.  In his eyes we see the light of a
     sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge.

                          DEIRDRE
               You better be careful, Seamus, before
               something happens a plastic surgeon can't
               fix.

                          SEAMUS
                   (a hideous laugh)
               Plastic fucking surgeon?
                   (indicates his face)
               You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre
               lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and
               I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those
               who done it to me, I'll take my pound of
               flesh before this is all over.

                          DEIRDRE
               You're thinking with your gun, Seamus,
               and not your head...

                          SEAMUS
                   (losing it)
               Shut up!!!
                   (he puts a gun to her head)
               Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior
               officer and you will do as I goddamn well
               say, is that understood?!?

     BEAT.  Deirdre bristles at Seamus's words but says nothing.

                          SEAMUS
               Do I need to repeat myself?

                          DEIRDRE
               No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR - SAME TIME

     THE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does -

     A LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. A CHATEAU OUTSIDE OF PARIS - NIGHT

     THE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.  The
     mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which
     shine from - THE CHATEAU.  Hundreds of years old, it sits far
     back from its own MAIN GATE.  In front of the Chateau - ARMED
     MEN.  Lots of them.  Whatever this place is, it's not one
     that invites company.  Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the
     Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding
     environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private
     gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has
     it.  We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN.
     Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like "Da!" and
     "Nyet!" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of
     the Russian Production Company.  BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE
     GARDENS, more everything.  It's well-patrolled, but there
     aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front,
     because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress -

     A WOODS -

     A forest, really.  Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic
     in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this
     place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.  And
     in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam.
     Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles
     through the woods to get here.  Both men exhausted from the
     walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit.
     They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.  Even
     though they're screened from the chateau back here, Sam
     reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincent's hands.

                          SAM
               Not here.  They might see it.

                          VINCENT
               If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm
               going to go out smoking.
                   (takes the cigarettes back and
                    lights one)
               Besides, there's half a forest between us
               and them, they can't see a goddamned
               thing.

     Vincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of
     his head.

                          SAM
               Time to quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just like that?

                          SAM
               Not just like that... Just before I turn
               around and it's six months from now and
               the first thing I do when I wake up in
               the morning is light a cigarette.

                          VINCENT
                   (obviously he does this)
               What of it?
                   (almost to himself)
               Samurai pain in the ass.

                          SAM
                   (he hates this)
               Would you stop with that...

                          VINCENT
               Why?  You've got more force of will than
               anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun
               like it's a part of you, you perform
               surgery on yourself without anesthesia...
                   (quick beat)
               And most amazing of all, you quit
               smoking, just like that.

                          SAM
                   (qith a cynical laugh)
               The mark of a true Samurai.
                   (seriously)
               What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no
               different than what you do.  We're both
               hired guns, and this is a job -- like any
               other job.

                          VINCENT
               Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is
               a job like any other?  Surely, if you are
               a hired gun, you realize that some times
               you just have to walk away without
               getting what you came for.

                          SAM
               Because I don't walk away.

                          VINCENT
               Why not?

                          SAM
               It's the one thing I've got left to hold
               onto.
                   (beat)
               Jean-Pierre is one of your closest
               friends, is he not?

                          VINCENT
               Closest and oldest.

                          SAM
               And yet you would have killed him to save
               my life.
                   (quick beat)
               You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that
               I can't even remember anymore.  I don't
               know that I ever even had it to begin
               with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to
               finish my job.

                          VINCENT
               And when you finish?  What then?  This
               package, whatever it is, do you give it
               to the CIA?  Do you really think they
               deserve it?

                          SAM
               That's a good question.

                          VINCENT
               Do you have a good answer?

                          SAM
                   (he's really just considering
                    this)
               No, I don't.

     INT. THE CHATEAU - MEANWHILE

     ARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon
     squad.

     MOVING THROUGH the Chateau itself, and from in here we see
     the side of France we haven't yet seen in this film: culture.
     Each room could be a museum, as we move through -

     A GALLERY, filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters -

     A PARLOR, with antique furniture, the youngest piece of which
     is two hundred years old -

     A BALLROOM, empty and barren, but lit by the dazzling light
     of an exquisite chandelier -

     A KITCHEN, where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the
     finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal
     you've ever seen.  Now - A SERVANT takes the tray and carries
     it out to -

     A DINING ROOM, and the table is set for a formal dinner for
     twenty, with crystal and china at every place setting, and
     yet the table is occupied by only one man -

     MIKHAEL RACHEV, Russian Gangster Supreme, called Mikhi.  Now -

     The Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi, and as this
     chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL
     BACK, MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table.

     EXT. THE CHATEAU WALLS - NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out.
     Attached to his wrist, by that same handcuff: the Briefcase.
     Gregor is admitted by a Guard as we -

     CUT TO:

     INT. THE DINING ROOM/CHATEAU - A LITTLE LATER

     Mikhi the Gangster is eating his dinner as Gregor is ushered
     into the room.  THREE THUGS hang back behind Gregor, watching
     to see what Mikhi wants.  Now -

     Mikhi waves the Thugs out of the room, leaving Gregor alone
     with the gangster.  Mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as
     he motions for Gregor to sit.

                          MIKHI
                   (in Russian, English subtitles)
               Sit, sit...
                   (offering a cigarette)
               Would you like one?

                          GREGOR
                   (in English)
               No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.
                   (letting that sink in for a
                    minute)
               Since I won't speak your language, and
               you can't speak mine, English will do
               nicely.

                          MIKHI
                   (makes no never mind to him)
               Whatever you wish...
                   (lights his own cigarette)
               This has all been a terrible mistake,
               Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with
               you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill
               you.

                          GREGOR
               Edvard said the same thing about you
               before he died.

                          MIKHI
               I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd
               believe him.

                          GREGOR
                   (suddenly sharp)
               Enough!

     Gregor raises the Briefcase which is still attached to his
     wrist via the handcuff.  Gregor rests the Briefcase on the
     table.

                          MIKHI
               Ahh...

     The moment of truth.  Before this scene can develop any
     further, a VOICE comes from Off Screen, and as the Voice
     speaks, Gregor blanches.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               The moment of truth, is it?

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre and Seamus have entered the room.
     And we notice something unusual: nobody is alarmed (except
     for Gregor, that is).  It's as if they were expected.

                          GREGOR
               What is he doing here?

     As Seamus speaks he walks through the room, examining the
     valuable china and crystal, all the while moving inexorably
     closer to Gregor.  His face is, if anything, even more
     horrific than it was a short while ago, as his formerly fresh
     wounds have started to scab over.

                          SEAMUS
               What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to
               see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the
               Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had
               hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull
               your thieving double cross.  But they
               only just found out that what's in the
               briefcase is completely useless without
               me.  I can't fight them, and they can't
               kill me -- that means we're gonna have to
               do business together.

                          GREGOR
               But you hate each other!

                          SEAMUS
               What's a little hate between business
               partners?

     EXT. THE WOODS - MEANWHILE

     Vincent's CIGARETTE is stubbed into a rock and the two men
     rise with a slow purpose.  They exchange a look and then Sam
     steps forward, leading the way

                          SAM
               I'm on point, Vincent.

     A WIDE ANGLE - THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Pure Kurosawa.  The JAPANESE DRUM we've heard before starts
     to play again as -

     THE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and
     into the brilliant light of the back lawn.  For one minute
     they stand still, and among the many weapons that Sam carries
     is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the
     SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword.  Now
     the two men start to move across the lawn, hugging the
     shadows of the various statues and hedges, trying to keep
     from being discovered for as long as possible.

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

                          GREGOR
                   (to Seamus)
               So, you've got it all figured, do you?

                          SEAMUS
               Figured enough to know there's an odd man
               out and I'm looking at him.

                          GREGOR
               I think not.
                   (holds up the Briefcase)
               I have, of course, taken the precaution
               of wiring the briefcase to explode five
               seconds after it opens.  Unless, of
               course, I deactivate it before it goes
               off.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (under her breath)
               That fucking figures...

                          GREGOR
               Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll
               kill myself and whoever happens to be
               near me at the time.

                          MIKHI
               And more importantly --

                          GREGOR
               I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

     BEAT.  Nobody moves.  Nobody speaks.  Until finally -

                          SEAMUS
               It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna
               have to sit down to table and work out an
               agreement.

     Before this entirely too-weird scenario can play itself we go
     back to -

     THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are closer to the Chateau, moving in stealth,
     avoiding any entanglements and then Sam turns a corner and
     comes face to face with - A GUARD, and his gun is aimed at
     Sam's head: Sam's a dead man as we go -

     BACK TO THE DINING ROOM

     AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE splits the night, and everyone in the
     room looks at one another, before Mikhi speaks.

                          MIKHI
               What was that?

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     The Guard who had Sam in his sights falls down, dead, shot by
     - Vincent, whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms.
     Vincent smiles at Sam.

                          VINCENT
               That's one less I owe you...

     Sam smiles, but it's no time to get satisfied.  their
     presence revealed, there's no point in moving quietly.  Sam
     draws his weapons and as he and Vincent charge across the
     lawn towards the Chateau while -

     BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

     MORE GUNSHOTS from outside -- not a war, but enough to cause
     serious alarm.  Deirdre, ever the soldier, draws her two
     automatic pistols.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (to Seamus and Mikhi)
               You two stay here and watch our mutual
               interest.

     She nods at Gregor and his Briefcase, indicating what this
     mutual interest is.  Then she turns and bolts the room, and
     as she does we're -

     BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

     Sam and Vincent are running along, hugging the ground and
     whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire
     rips into the ground around them, Russian thugs not even sure
     what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam
     and Vincent hurtle towards -

     A BACK ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU -

     Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent
     burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in
     from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent
     are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then -
     They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol
     in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when
     he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only
     when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights
     with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in
     the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves,
     and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is
     quiet.  Everybody's dead except for Sam and Vincent.  They
     drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they
     move towards - THE DOOR - It leads to two passages, each one
     leading to a separate wing of the chateau.

                          SAM
               Let's work our way through the building.
               I'll take one wing, you take the other.

     Vincent and Sam split up, moving into separate WINGS of the
     Chateau, and as they move off Sam speaks a word of warning.

                          SAM
               Watch your back, Vincent.

     And then they're gone, and we're with -

     Deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to
     room, and we're with her for a minute, the JAPANESE DRUM
     starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more
     drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and
     suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard, dragging
     Deirdre's attention towards -

     THE BALLROOM -

     And Sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three
     Gunmen.  He kills the first, and then the second, and then -
     No third.  The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam
     fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide,
     ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor
     with glass.  And now we're -

     ON DEIRDRE -

     Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
     gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead.  Deirdre has
     almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out, and
     the two of them CRASH TOGETHER, sending the two of them
     sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the
     Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground, Sam loses his
     weapon in the fall, but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of
     her two guns.  Now the two of them roll to their feet, and as
     they do we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse
     than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
     his face is becoming more grotesque.  Little pustules have
     started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish
     viscous liquid.  A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard,
     and Seamus, who is no longer capable of thinking straight,
     loses it.

                          SEAMUS
               I can't take it anymore.
                   (to Mikhi)
               Watch him, man, I'm going out and finish
               what needs finishing!

     And Seamus is gone, and so are we -- back to -

     THE BALLROOM -

     Where Deirdre has her two guns pointed at Sam and - Does nothing.
     BEAT.

                          SAM
               Go on, them...

     But Deirdre can't do it.  There's something between these
     two, and now - Sam looks around and sees Deirdre's other
     pistol lying on a broken chair, and now he -

     Kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg, causing it to
     function as a lever, sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR in a
     graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sam's Hand.  Now
     he's armed and he looks back at - Deirdre.  Her FINGER
     tightens on the trigger, she's almost ready to shoot -- if
     Sam raises his piece, he's a dead man.

                          DEIRDRE
               Let it go, Sam, walk away.

     In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he
     smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways, into a
     nearby corridor, vanishing.

                          DEIRDRE
               God damn it!

     She runs after him but she's too late -- The corridor outside
     is empty.  Now we're back in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     With Gregor and Mikhi, and the tension is unbearable, because
     they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and
     then stops, but they don't have the least idea of what's
     going on.  Still, Mikhi won't let Gregor leave without giving
     up the Briefcase.  Mikhi has a gun on Gregor, who in turn
     holds the Briefcase close, ready to open it and set off the 5
     Second Timer that will blow it up.

                          GREGOR
                   (a feral hiss)
               We'll die if we stay here!

                          MIKHI
                   (threatening with the gun)
               You'll die if you leave here.

     Gregor sits back down, fairly close to Mikhi.  Then, in a
     manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices, Gregor extracts
     a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the
     Briefcase.  Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm
     forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's
     throat.  Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade,
     already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
     slashed artery.  Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground,
     jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up
     the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move
     to - 

     THE GALLERY -

     Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200
     years old.  This place is a maze, what with it's walls of
     paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors
     which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block
     sight lines.  Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a
     gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting
     him down.  We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split
     up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian
     voices.  Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -
     Nothing.  No Vincent.  Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES
     through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.  It's
     Vincent.  His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him
     in place.  Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the
     painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.  Now - The other men
     are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps
     out firing -

     And now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them,
     using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage,
     gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then -
     No four.  Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where
     he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting
     Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.  The Last Guy has
     the drop on Vincent.  Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty
     little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A
     BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.  It's Sam.  Now
     Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved
     Vincent's life.

                          VINCENT
               You have to stop doing that!

                          SAM
               I'll work on it...

     The two men don't have time for any more words, they move
     from the Gallery and find themselves in -

     THE DINING ROOM -

     Where they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the
     Gangster.  Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a
     VOICE comes from BEHIND them -

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
               Turn around real slow, and try hard not
               to breathe when you do it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them, and
     he's got his gun pointed straight at Sam's heart.  If Seamus
     is enraged at discovering Gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to
     find Sam in his place.

                          SEAMUS
               It's you...
                   (touches his face)
               You're the one did this to my face, are
               you?

                          SAM
               That's me.

                          SEAMUS
               Have a nice afterlife.

     Seamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards
     Sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent
     leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side,
     a huge splash of red against his white shirt.  He falls to
     the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time,
     and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS
     RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal,
     taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the
     table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV
     showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then
     suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other
     - Mexican Standoff.  Suddenly, from Off Screen -

                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)
               Seamus!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the
     two men.

                          SEAMUS
               Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking
               bullet in his head!

     Deirdre hesitates, uncertain.

                          SEAMUS
               Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can
               find that stinking Gregor, he's got the
               bloody package!  For God's sake, you're a
               soldier...

     These last words sink into Deirdre: she is a soldier.  Her
     gun swivels towards Sam.

                          SEAMUS
                   (sensing he's getting to
                    her)
               You're one of us...You been born and bred
               with your own people, you can't go
               against your nature.  C'mon, girl, I'm
               you're people.

     Deirdre makes up her mind.

                          DEIRDRE
               I'm no girl, Seamus...

     She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a
     huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW.

                          DEIRDRE
               And you ain't nobody's people.

     She moves with Sam to Vincent, who is seriously wounded --
     perhaps life-threateningly so.

                          SAM
                   (to Deirdre)
               Let's get him out of here...

                          VINCENT
               Finish the job...

                          SAM
               And now...

                          VINCENT
                   (a commanding whisper)
               Finish it!

     Sam considers, but before he can make up his mind, Deirdre
     sees something through the wreck of the Dining Room Window -

     OUT ON THE BACK LAWN - We've already seen that it's bordered
     on one side by the woods, for the first time we notice - A
     LAKE, which laps against a PRIVATE DOCK, where a row boat is
     tethered.  Now - BENEATH A VERY FULL MOON, the stark figure
     of Gregor makes its way toward the Dock.

                          DEIRDRE
                   (calling out)
               Sam...

     Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making
     his escape.  Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed
     out from blood loss.

                          VINCENT
               I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go
               out and get the bastard.

     Same makes up his mind, and as Vincent passes out, Sam runs
     out after Deirdre and towards -

     THE PRIVATE DOCK -

     And as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM.

                          DEIRDRE
               He's got the briefcase rigged to explode
               five seconds after anybody other than
               himself tries to open it.

     And now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no
     Gregor.  And the Boat is still there.  Before Sam can
     restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat.

                          SAM
               Deirdre, wait up --

     But it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind -

     A BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what
     happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head.
     His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase, which is
     still handcuffed to his wrist.

                          GREGOR
               You might have made a good field agent
               you arrogant American prick, but you're
               not smart enough to go up against me.

     Gregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake.  This
     Private Dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the
     water is nearly five feet.  Sam has reached a position where
     there is no right answer.  Still, he points his gun at
     Gregor, who in turn shields himself with Deirdre's body.

                          GREGOR
               Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the
               bitch, I don't care.
                   (beat)
               And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting.
               Put down your weapon and walk away.

                          DEIRDRE
               Don't do it, Sam!

                          GREGOR
               Shut up!

                          DEIRDRE
               He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though
               me and kill this fucker.

                          SEAMUS (O.S.)
                   (a horrible croak)
               If you don't, I will...

     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus is somehow still barely alive -- he's
     not long for this world, but the will for revenge has driven
     him this far.

                          SEAMUS
                   (to Sam, in a cold pale rage)
               Shoot that traitorous bitch and I'll let
               you live.

     THE TOP OF SEAMUS'S HEAD explodes, finishing him off once and
     for all, killed by -

     Vincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary
     shot.  But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own
     blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the
     boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET
     FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN -

     IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're
     in SLOW MOTION as -

     Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close
     the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the
     other, into the lake, while -

     BABOOM!  The case EXPLODES, a flash of phosphorescent white
     light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was
     inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and
     when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone, while -
     THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake, booming again and
     again until finally there is - SILENCE.  Sam looks out over
     the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none.  And
     then, after we've held for a BEAT longer than it should be
     possible for her to have survived - her head splits the
     surface and she emerges, coughing.  Sam reaches down to help
     her out.

                          SAM
               Are you alright?

                          DEIRDRE
               Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in
               here!

     Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them
     immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we
     start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can
     be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.
     And we're STILL PULLING BACK ON -

     THE CHATEAU - Or what's left of it, because it's started to
     burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night,
     like something out of medieval times as we -

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - NIGHT

     Sam waits outside a hospital room, inside of which we get a
     glimpse of - A DOCTOR tending to a heavily bandaged and
     sedated Vincent.  As Sam waits - TWO GENDARMES and a
     PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE approach.  The Detective looks at Sam
     for a BEAT, and then goes to push past him.  Sam blocks his
     way.

                          DETECTIVE
               I need to speak with that man.

                          SAM
               I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

     Sam reaches into his coat, and for a moment everybody thinks
     he's going for his gun, but instead he comes out with - A
     PIECE OF PAPER.  He hands it to the Detective.

                          SAM
               Call that number and ask them what you
               should do.

     The Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously.

     FIVE MINUTES LATER -

     The Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks
     over at Sam in disgust.  Without another word, the Detective
     signals to the two Gendarmes, and all three men exit.  Now -

     The DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to
     him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks
     back.  Everything in SUBTITLED.

                          DOCTOR
               You can see your friend, now.

                          SAM
               Thank you very much.

                          DOCTOR
               The field dressing you put on saved his
               life.
                   (giving him a look)
               Where di you learn to do that?

                          SAM
               Here and there, I guess.

     The Doctor isn't entirely satisfied with this answer, but
     it's the only one she's going to get, because Sam moves past
     into -

     INT. VINCENT'S ROOM

     He's barely alive -- but alive nonetheless.  And he's heard
     Sam speak in French to the Doctor.

                          VINCENT
               You son-of-a-bitch...

                          SAM
               What?

                          VINCENT
               You speak French.

                          SAM
               What of it?

                          VINCENT
                   (in mock exasperation)
               Nothing...

     He lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.

                          VINCENT
                   (repeating the Doctor's words
                    in English)
               "Your field dressing saved his life."
               That's three I owe you.

                          SAM
               You don't owe me a goddamned thing,
               Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in
               front of a bullet for me.
                   (very seriously, he now
                    believes this)
               I owe you a heavy debt.

                          VINCENT
                   (relishing this)
               I know.

                          SAM
                   (rising to leave)
               You better get some sleep, alright?

                          VINCENT
               Tell me something first.
                   (a quick beat)
               The package: what was it?

                          SAM
               I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a
               bunch of people who are too dead to tell
               us.  There's probably a couple of guys
               back at the Company who know, but I don't
               think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

                          VINCENT
               What happened to it?
     
                          SAM
               Gone.  Destroyed.

                          VINCENT
                   (sighs, then a beat)
               I guess that's for the best.

     Sam turns for the door but Vincent has one last thing to say.

                          VINCENT
               Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake,
               you could have killed the two of them
               with one shot.  You could have had the
               package, finished the job.  But you
               didn't, you sacrificed the job to save
               her life.  Why?

     Same has to think about this for a second, and his answer
     reveals just how full circle he's come.

                          SAM
               It's what you would have done.

     And on that note Sam exits the room, leaving a bemused
     Vincent behind.

     EXT. THE BANK OF THE RIVER SEINE - EARLY MORNING

     A WISPY FOG atmospherically rises off the river -- not too
     thick, not too thin.

     A TITLE: One month later...

     We're MOVING along the cobble-stone walk next to the river as
     a VOICE cuts through the fog.

                          VINCENT (V.O.)
               Would you just smoke already...

     A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam, Vincent and Deirdre are having
     morning coffee.  A mostly-healed Vincent is smoking a
     cigarette, trying to get Sam to light up.

                          SAM
               I told you, I quit.

                          VINCENT
               Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate
               smoking alone.
                   (turning to Deirdre)
               How about you?  I thought all you IRA
               types smoked.

                          DEIRDRE
               Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill
               more patriots than bullets.
                   (a quick beat)
               Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

                          VINCENT
               So where do you go from here?

                          DEIRDRE
               I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the
               three of us might partner up -- guns for
               hire, that sort of thing.

                          VINCENT
               I'm up for that...

     The two of them turn to Sam, but he shakes his head.

                          SAM
               Not me.  You work too often with the same
               people and you become friends -- clouds
               your judgement.

                          DEIRDRE
               Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends
               already we wouldn't be here now, would
               we?

                          VINCENT
               She's got a point.
                   (playing a trump card)
               Besides, I know of a job that's
               available.

     Sam can't help it -- he's interested.

                          SAM
               How much does it pay?

     SLAM CUT TO:

     EXT. OUT ON THE RIVER SEINE - MEANWHILE

     SILENCE AND FOG.  A RIVER FERRY does a slow ghostly glide
     down the river, and in seconds it approaches -

     THE RIVERSIDE CAFE, which appears through the mist, looked at
     by --

     A SLEEK PAIR OF SUN GLASSES attached to a young PUNK in a
     leather coat, and the Punk is looking at - Sam, Vincent, and
     especially: Deirdre.  Sam looks up and shouts a warning as -
     The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps
     the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent -

                          PUNK
               This is for Seamus!

     BOOM!  The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's
     gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The
     Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the
     Ferry which never stops as -

     THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS
     dropping their trays.  But - Sam doesn't run, and neither
     does Vincent.  Sam stands, stunned by what he sees - Deirdre
     lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead.  A
     BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance, but
     quickly growing closer.  Now - Vincent looks at Deirdre's
     corpse, then at Sam, who is unable to move.  For maybe the
     first time in his professional career, Sam is staggered by
     the loss of a life.  Vincent gently takes Sam's arm.

                          VINCENT
                   (soft yet urgent)
               We have to go, Sam, we can't be here.

     Sam looks at Vincent, and for a moment Sam struggles to find
     something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing.  The
     SIRENS are getting louder -

                          VINCENT
                   (a little louder, bordering
                    desperation)
               Let's go!!

     Vincent literally drags Sam away and now the SIRENS have
     arrived, followed quickly by - THE GENDARMES, who come
     running into the Cafe but - It's empty except for Deirdre's
     body.  Now -

     THE STREET ABOVE THE RIVER -

     Sam and Vincent are running through patchy fog, Vincent
     leading the way, and now -

     We're CLOSER ON Vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he
     feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to
     relax.  He collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving,
     shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for Sam.

                          VINCENT
                   (thrusting the cigarettes out to
                    Sam)
               Doctor's orders...

     But Sam isn't there to take the cigarette -- Vincent looks
     around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the
     fog has covered any sign of Sam.  Vincent stands there,
     stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that
     slowly falls back to Vincent's side as he realizes that Sam
     has left him on purpose.  Then - Vincent lights both
     cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the
     stone wall - THE GLOWING CIGARETTE arcs through the air until
     it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.

                          VINCENT (O.S.)
               Goodbye, Sam...

     BACK AT THE CAFE -

     The Gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to
     secure since everyone has run away).  A majority of cops
     surround Deirdre's dead body, but - One GENDARME wanders
     around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something -

     ON THE STREET ABOVE -

     A SHAPE IN THE FOG.  The wind blows and the fog clears for a
     second, and we see that it's - Sam.  Getting one last look at
     Deirdre.  Quickly - The Gendarme points Sam out but as he
     does the wind continues to blow and - THE FOG swallows Sam.
     Seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does - Sam is
     gone.

     FADE OUT.
RUSH

1   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   1

    Dark clouds passing overhead.

    The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in
    Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..


2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2

    A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
    Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..


3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3

    The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of
    international TV commentators in different languages.

                         COMMENTATORS
               ...in places the track is still
               dangerously wet, but following a
               drivers meeting the decision has been
               taken. The race is going ahead...


4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4

    The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
    wearing a fireproof balaclava...

    Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
    name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.

                         NIKI (V/O)
               My grandfather always said history is
               cruel and reductive and no matter how
               long we live, or how much we achieve -
               we are remembered for very little. So
               make sure it's the right things.

    NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
    Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

    Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
    using slicks or wets?


5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5

    We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major
    Grand Prix. All around us...




                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                         2
5   CONTINUED:                                                       5


    Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An
    OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
    Minute"...

    Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.

                           NIKI
                 This is bullshit. We have no control
                 over our legacy. We cannot choose what
                 we are remembered for...

    A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
    above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...

                           MECHANIC
                 Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare
                 anche tu?
                     (Mass is going on slicks. You
                      want to change?)

    NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
    helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
    MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.

                           NIKI
                 Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
                 my rivalry with this asshole. And the
                 1976 season.

    NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
    Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...

                           NIKI
                 What about Hunt? Has he changed?

                           MECHANIC
                 No, he's going on wets.

    The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
    mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..

    The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
    HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.

    NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
    glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
    flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..

                           NIKI
                 I don't know why it became such a big
                 thing. We were just drivers. Busting
                 each other's balls. To me this is
                 perfectly normal. But other people saw
                 it differently.

               deeper. And changed us both somehow.
               Forever.

    NIKI stares, then...

                         NIKI
               Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da
               bagnato.
                   (Then we go on wets, too.)

    The ten-second board is held up.

    NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
    split-second, eyes staring...

    NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
    engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000
    RPM.

                         NIKI
               Maybe that explains the state of mind
               I was in. And why it happened. The
               other thing I'm remembered for.
                   (a beat)
               On August 1st, that same year...

    CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".

    The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his
    engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch
    scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.

    NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin
    leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..

    NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
    a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.

    His arch-rival. HUNT.

    But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
    Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.

    NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
    decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
    change tyres...

    NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at
    one end...
                                                                          4



6   INT. PITS - DAY                                                   6

    Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
    crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the
    pits to change to dry tyres.

    It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...

    The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four
    men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same
    Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..

                         MECHANIC
               Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le
               slicks!
                   (See? I told you to go on
                    slicks!!)

                         NIKI
               Bullshit. Where's Hunt?

                            MECHANIC
               There!

    NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black
    helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...

                            NIKI
               C'mon...!!

    NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns
    make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.

                         NIKI
               What's GOING ON???

    "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and
    NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost
    him dear...


7   EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                             7

    Archive TV commentary from the world's race COMMENTATORS
    stations informs us of the positions.

    MASS leading, HUNT in 3rd, LAUDA in 20th...


8   INT. NIKI'S CAR - DAY                                             8

    NIKI gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,
    trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine
    screaming.

    He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
    Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place
    now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.

    NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering
    wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven
    any harder.

    NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
    the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.
    And tight. Too tight. A mistake...

    "Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
    inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155
    mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..

    "Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,
    and is thrown across the track..

    Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,
    with another car bearing down upon him...

                          NIKI
                 No...!

    The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a
    sickening, terrifying impact.

    The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane
    gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his
    seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.

    NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees
    temperature. Trapped inside his car.

    Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...

    Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV
    commentators helplessly describe what's happening..

    NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable
    figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..

    Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
    to undo NIKI's seatbelt..

    Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.
    Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out
    in agony, inhaling the powder..

    Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,
    the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.

    Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

    Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...


9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9

    We're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular
    Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..

    Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-
    feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.

                         NURSE
               Emergency...

    She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is
    being said. Then her expression changes...

                         NURSE
               Okay...standing by!

    The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR
    colleagues...

                         NURSE
               That was the race-track..! There's
               been an accident..! A driver's been
               injured and is on his way in..!

    Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as
    DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...

    All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.

    The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
    consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...

    CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER"

    Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks
    through and into the accident and emergency unit.

    Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
    overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,
    (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...

    A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to
    describe an Englishman. SEXY.

    Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and
    the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no
    mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous..

                            JAMES
                  I think the racetrack telephoned ahead
                  that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..?

     JAMES notices all the NURSES staring..

                            JAMES
                  What's the matter? No one seen a spot
                  of blood before?

                            NURSE
                  Are you all right?

                            JAMES
                  Absolutely fine.


10   INT. A&E UNIT - DAY                                              10

     The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls,
     checking for wounds, cuts and bruises...

                            NURSE
                  We all thought you'd been in an
                  accident.

                            JAMES
                  I have. If you call a friendly
                  disagreement with another driver an
                  accident.

                            NURSE
                  What did you disagree about?

                            JAMES
                  None of your business. Ouch.

                              NURSE
                  Sorry.

                              JAMES
                  His wife.

                            NURSE
                  That's going to need a couple of
                  stitches. It's a nasty cut.

                            JAMES
                  It was a nasty blow. Done with a
                  bloody spanner.

                            NURSE
                  Why? What did you do?

                  Nothing! Only what she begged me to
                  do.

     The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest...

                            NURSE
                  Which was..?

     She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest..

     JAMES looks up. Their eyes meet..

                            JAMES
                  Be happy to show you if you like.


11   INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  11

     `Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble
     through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...

     The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor
     student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer
     cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two
     budgerigars.

     A mattress on the floor.

     Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's
     crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
     government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,
     leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

     JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-
     dressed, but already passionately making love...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  I have a theory why women like racing
                  drivers. It's not because they respect
                  what we do...driving round and round
                  in circles. Mostly they think that's
                  pathetic. And they're probably right..
                      (a beat)
                  It's our closeness to death.

     JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making love
     in the shower...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  The closer you are to death, the more
                  alive you FEEL...the more alive you
                  ARE. And they can see that in you.
                  FEEL that in you. The way you live.
                  Willing to risk everything.

                  With no thought for tomorrow...as if
                  each day is your last. It's a
                  wonderful way to live...and the ONLY
                  way to drive. The only way to get that
                  tenth of a second on everyone else...

     The lovemaking becomes more intense...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  To dare to be one step bolder...one
                  step faster...

     JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  Sure one step closer to death...

     JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  But one step closer to victory, too...

     JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the
     bed. Exhausted.


12   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - DAY                             12

     A grotty old race track in South London.

     JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his
     battered old mini. They get out. She looks up, seeing the
     mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..

                            NURSE
                  I've never been to a Grand Prix
                  before.

                            JAMES
                  You still haven't. This is Formula 3.

                            NURSE
                  What's that?

                            JAMES
                  A lower division. Where people like me
                  mess about in the hope of finding
                  sponsors or being talent-spotted to
                  race in Formula 1.

     JAMES leads the NURSE into...
                                                                           10

                          DOC
                How do you do?

                          JAMES

                          HESKETH

                          HESKETH
                You sure? It's Krug. Clos de Mesnil.

                          NURSE
                It's also ten in the morning.

                Oh, dear. Superstar? You haven't
                brought us a bore, have you?

     JAMES strips off, changing into his racing overalls.

                          JAMES
                Trust me. Nursie's anything BUT a

     The NURSE, meanwhile, drifts over to look at the car where
     BUBBLES is making last minute checks...

                            NURSE
                  That's the car?

                            BUBBLES
                  That's her. The Dastle Mk 9...with the
                  Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine.
                  She's no beauty. But goes like the
                  clappers.

     An odd-looking car. A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with
     yellow strips along the side and James's name in small
     letters. It looks small, dangerously fragile.

                            JAMES
                  Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.

     The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound.
     She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck...

                            HESKETH
                  Nothing to be worried about! Does it
                  before every race! Good sign,
                  actually. Means he's stoked!


14   EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                         14

     JAMES continues vomiting...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  There's a lie that all drivers tell
                  themselves. "Death is something that
                  happens to other people." That's how
                  you find the courage to get in the car
                  in the first place...

     JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth...

                            HESKETH
                  All right, Superstar?

                            JAMES
                  Never better, Patron.

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  Because bad things only happen to
                  others, right?

                            HESKETH
                  Have a gargle with this.

     JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then
     swallows, puts on his balaclava...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  Problem is deep down you know that's a
                  lie. That it could happen to you at
                  any moment.

                            HESKETH
                  Quick toke of this...

     HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a
     huge lungful from....

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  So how do you make that terror go
                  away? Well, booze is good for that.
                  And wacky baccy. But better than
                  everything else is...sex.

     JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips,
     then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car.

     JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM
     as the engine starts...

                            HESKETH
                  Ahhhh! What music! They could never
                  have predicted it, those pioneers that
                  invented the automobile that it would
                  possess us like this, in our
                  imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men
                  love women...but even more than that,
                  men love CARS...


15   EXT. PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                              15

     JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already
     unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it..

                            JAMES
                  Who's that?

                            DOC
                  He's new. Some German.

                            BUBBLES
                      (corrects)
                  Austrian.

                            JAMES
                  Is there a difference?

     JAMES looks over. On the side of the car, painted markings, in
     the form of a signature, "Niki Lauda".

                            JAMES
                  All bloody Goosesteppers.


16   EXT. RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                           16

     JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner.

     NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second
     bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No
     right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac.

     Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly..

     JAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to
     slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash...


17   EXT. PITS - SAME TIME                                            17

     HESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the
     sidelines...

                            BUBBLES
                  That move was suicide!

                            HESKETH
                  It was also quite brilliant!! God he's
                  got balls!!


18   EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY                                            18

     JAMES carries on driving. Flat out.

     But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere. As if his
     car has 50 bhp more.

     And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the
     Englishman beaten..

     JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful
     madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...

     ...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI's
     car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness.

     NIKI and JAMES's cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal
     spins..but luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right
     way...

     ...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to
     change gears, and continue driving...

     NIKI's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing
     THE WRONG WAY on the track...

     NIKI's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow,
     like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him...

                            NIKI
                  Umgotteswillen...

     NIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car,
     when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car.

     NIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as....

     "SMASH", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it
     would have killed him instantly).

     "WHAM", another car narrowly misses him...

     "CRASH", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive...

     Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues...

     NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape.
     He rips off his helmet, furious...

     And now we see NIKI LAUDA's face for the first time. Sharp-
     featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth.

     Something unmistakably rat-like about him.


19   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - LATE AFTERNOON                 19

     JAMES is on the podium, having won. He's with the NURSE, and
     HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with
     champagne..

     NIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and
     shouts out, still incandescent...

                            NIKI
                  Hey...asshole! That was my line! I had
                  that corner...

                            JAMES
                  You mean the one you spun out of? And
                  finished facing the other way? I think
                  that corner had you.

     Laughter.

                  That move was total suicide. What if I
                  hadn't braked? We'd have crashed..!!

                            JAMES
                  But we didn't, did we? Thanks to your
                  impeccable `survival' instincts...

     JAMES makes chicken noises...

                            NIKI
                  Fuck you! What's your name?

                            HESKETH
                  James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember it,
                  my little Jerry friend. Because one
                  day he will be World Champion.

                            JAMES
                  Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple.
                  "Hunt". It rhymes with....

     "BEEEEP", a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES's c-word
     insult...

                             JAMES
                  ...a word that happens to describe you
                  perfectly.

     Laughter. NIKI gives JAMES the finger, "Screw you, asshole".
     The NURSE watches NIKI go..

                            NURSE
                  Who was that?

                            JAMES
                  No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad
                  loser. Forget him.

     NIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised..


20   EXT. VIENNA SKYLINE - DAY                                        20

     To establish: the Austrian capital. OVER THIS: the sound of
     NIKI's voice...

                            NIKI (V/O)
                  In my home town, Vienna, my family is
                  famous for one thing. Business. My
                  grandfather was a businessman, my
                  father, too...
                                                                           16

     NIKI is in front of a mirror, and dresses smartly in a jacket,
     and open necked shirt, evidently a little nervous...

                          NIKI (V/O)
                So when they heard I wanted to race
                cars for a living, they had a few
                things to say...


22   INT. LAUDA GRANDFATHER HOUSE - NIGHT                             22

     A large, forbidding dining room. NIKI's FATHER and terrifying
     GRANDFATHER, are eating supper. GRANDFATHER shakes his head,
     clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles)

                          GRANDFATHER
                Never! Racing is for playboys and
                dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with
                nothing in their heads. The name
                `Lauda' appears on the front pages,
                with politicians and economists, not
                on the back pages with...
                    (gestures in contempt)
                ...footballers and skiers. If you want
                my money, you do as I say and follow
                me into my business..

     NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER..

                          NIKI (V/O)
                It's in moments like this that you
                discover who you really are..

     ...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for
     ever, NIKI gets to his feet..

                          NIKI
                Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in
                me. But when I'm World Champion, and I
                have the trophy, and my name is not
                just on the back pages, but on the
                front too, you will regret it.

     NIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears...

                          GRANDFATHER
                You dare sit at my table and lecture
                me on what I will or won't regret? Get
                out! Impertinent wretch! Consider
                yourself disowned!
                                                                          17

     NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and
     LAWYERS. They speak in German...

                          BANKER
                Another loan? Herr Lauda, you still
                haven't repaid the other...

                          BANKER 2
                Three..

                          BANKER
                Totalling millions of Schillings. Plus
                your Grandfather called to inform us
                he will no longer be offering
                security.

                          NIKI
                I know. There is no room for failure.
                I understand that.

                          NIKI (V/O)
                But I was still a Lauda...


24   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ ROAD TO VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                   24

     NIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on
     his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading
     "Flughafen". (Airport)...

                          NIKI (V/O)
                ...which meant I was still a
                businessman above everything else.


25   EXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                                       25

     A private jet. A balding, blazered Englishman in late middle-
     age (LOUIS STANLEY), owner of BRM racing, disembarks onto the
     tarmac...

                          NIKI (V/O)
                It just so happens that the business I
                deal in is speed.


26   INT. VIENNA AIRPORT - CAFE                                      26

     NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe.

     Contracts are open on the table. NIKI is signing. LOUIS
     STANLEY is counter-signing...

                  In return for your money you get a
                  car, mechanics and a place on the
                  team. Plus fifty per cent of starting
                  fees and bonuses for podium finishes.

                            NIKI
                  Who's the number one driver?

                  Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to
                  him at all times.

     NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up...

                  Why would I defer to him if I am
                  paying his wages?

     NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades..

                            STANLEY
                  Because he's a proven winner at the
                  highest level, a good guy, and someone
                  who quite frankly, could teach you a
                  thing or two.

     NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...

                            NIKI
                  OK. There is one clause missing.

                            STANLEY
                  The one about mechanics' exclusivity?
                  Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM.
                  All information is shared between ALL
                  our drivers..

                            NIKI
                  And I made it perfectly clear that my
                  mechanics work for me. No one else.
                  This is something I cannot sign.

     NIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares...

                            STANLEY
                  All right. I'll have the lawyers amend
                  it.

                            NIKI
                  While you're at it you can tell them
                  to amend the clause for podium
                  finishes. Podium is first THREE
                  places, not just wins.

     NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut,
     taking it with him..

                          NIKI
                You'll get the money on signature, as
                agreed. See you at winter testing.

     NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves. STANLEY watches the attache
     case disappear.

                          STANLEY
                If that little git drives half as well
                as he negotiates, we're going to be
                fine.

28   INT. AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT                                      28

     An awards ceremony is in progress. The room is thick with
     cigar and cigarette smoke. A presenter on stage, wearing black
     tie...

                          PRESENTER
                I'm delighted to say the winner of the
                British Guild of Motoring Writers
                award for the `Most Promising Driver
                of the Year' is James Hunt...

     A loud, boisterous cheer goes up at the Hesketh Racing table.

     JAMES turns to a (new/different) girlfriend beside him, gives
     her a lingering kiss on the lips, then gets to his feet,
     shakes hands with HESKETH, and BUBBLES and skips up to the
     podium...

                          JAMES
                Thank you. My parents always wanted me
                to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and
                gave me a first class education...but
                to no avail. My brothers are the
                success stories. I get bored easily. I
                have a hot head, an inability to
                tolerate discipline. I fall out with
                people left and right. I'm quick to
                settle matters with my fists. The only
                creatures I've ever loved and treated
                well, are budgerigars. In any normal
                area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total
                liability. All I've got going for me
                is I'm quick in a car.

                            WOMAN
                  That's not all!

     Laughter.

                            JAMES
                  So thank you for acknowledging that.
                  And giving me this...
                      (indicating trophy)
                  I'm going to give it to my Dad, and
                  tell him to put it on the mantle-piece
                  and imagine it's a first class degree
                  in medicine.


29   INT. AWARDS CEREMONY - LATER                                    29

     Afterwards: everyone is celebrating. Thanks to JAMES, every
     pretty woman in the club is around. The trophy is perched
     beside bottles of champagne...

                            HESKETH
                  Well done, Superstar. One more season
                  in F2 then I'll move you up. To the
                  big time.

                            JAMES
                  You don't think I'm ready now?

                            HESKETH
                  You are! I'm not! I've got to find you
                  a car first. And the money. The
                  economics of Formula 1 are terrifying.

                            BUBBLES
                  Hurry up. You don't want him to do
                  what Lauda did.

     `Pop', HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne...

                            BUBBLES (contíd)
                  The Goosestepper. Remember him?

     JAMES makes the chicken noises again..

                            BUBBLES
                  Said he no longer wanted to risk his
                  life with "a bunch of crazy amateurs
                  and losers..."

                            BUBBLES
                  Said if he was going to risk his life,
                  he would only do so on the big
                  roulette table. Formula 1. So he got
                  himself a drive with BRM.

                            JAMES
                  What? How? He never won a thing! Not a
                  single bloody race.

                            HESKETH
                  Amateurs are what made this country
                  great.

                            BUBBLES
                  Took out a loan, apparently. Paid for
                  it himself.

     JAMES stares. Already sick with envy.

                            JAMES
                  That's either an act of utter lunacy,
                  or the ballsiest thing I ever heard.

     The PAUL RICARD circuit near Marseilles in the South of

                  Take a seat, please. I'll get someone
                  to come and collect you...

     NIKI watches as she telephones the BRM workshops...

                            AGNES
                  Hi. There's someone here for you?

                            NIKI
                      (prompting)

                       louder)
                  SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.

     She hangs up. NIKI decides against pointing out her mistake.

                            AGNES
                  They'll be right here.

                               NIKI
                  Thank you.

     A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI
     watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...

                            NIKI
                  Worked here long?

                               AGNES
                  Excuse me?

                            NIKI
                  Just wondered if you've worked here
                  long?

                            AGNES
                  Almost eight years.

                            NIKI
                  That long? And they didn't promote you
                  yet?

                  Yes, several times. I am the AGNES.
                  Agnes Bonnet. If you're looking for
                  the receptionist, she's on her lunch.

     NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to
     say something when the door opens, and...

     Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..

     Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars,
     they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.

     What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.
     What have you done to the weather?

     They make her laugh. And smile.

     NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He
     gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect
     him.

     As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the
     other DRIVERS. Intrigued.

     He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.


31   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                         31

     The car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the
     car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...

                          STANLEY
                Niki, let me introduce you to our
                number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and
                our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise..

     The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY

                reporting exclusively to you. As per

     REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes
     hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS.

     NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro
     sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just
     above the driver's helmet...

                          MECHANIC

                  She looks heavy. How much does she
                  weigh?

                               MECHANIC
                  540 kilos.

                            NIKI
                  That's crazy. Why so heavy..?

                            MECHANIC
                  It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing
                  weighs 190k alone.

                            NIKI
                  What horsepower are you getting out of
                  it?

                               MECHANIC
                  450.

                            NIKI
                  Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the
                  engine needs to be 20k lighter.

                            MECHANIC
                  We already tried...

                            NIKI
                  Did you use magnesium parts?

     The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...

     Shooting from above:

     The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now
     spread all over the workshop floor.

     NIKI's team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night
     making the adjustments which NIKI is suggesting...

                  Any solid plate, strip it out...

     More disbelieving, skeptical looks. The car is in pieces on
     the floor. NIKI brews coffee to keep people alert. Focused.

                            NIKI
                  And when we've done that, we need to
                  look at the aerodynamics. Front and
                  rear wing..

     More mutinous looks. "Who is this asshole?"


34   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - FIRST LIGHT                                 34

     Daylight breaks over the race-track. The doors to the workshop
     open, and the MECHANICS and NIKI emerge - their work done.

     NIKI goes to shake hands with the MECHANICS...

                            NIKI
                  OK. Thank you. Good night..

     But they're exhausted. Refuse to shake hands with this nut.


35   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   35

     LATER: one of the BRM cars screams round the race-track...

     NIKI watches on the sidelines as CLAY REGAZZONI is time-
     testing his car. He walks over to where LOUIS STANLEY and
     several MECHANICS are doing the timings...

                            NIKI
                  What was his time?

                            STANLEY
                  Two minutes six seconds.

                            NIKI
                  OK. Now put him in my car, and he'll
                  go round under two minutes.

                            STANLEY
                  Six seconds faster? Impossible.

     NIKI looks up to see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER again
     on the other side of the track.

     NIKI waves hi. AGNES waves back. Smiles. NIKI raises his
     eyebrow. Surprised.


36   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   36

     REGAZZONI gets into NIKI's car.
                                                                         26



37   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                 37

     REGAZZONI races round the track at full speed.

     REGAZZONI roars past the finishing line in NIKI's car. LOUIS
     STANLEY looks at the stop watch..

     His expression changes.


38   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                 38

     STANLEY comes into the workshop where NIKI and his MECHANICS
     are in conversation, getting changed...

                          STANLEY
                All right. What did you do to the car?

                          NIKI
                That's information I will share with
                you under certain conditions only.

     STANLEY stares, bracing himself..

                           STANLEY
                Go on...

                          NIKI
                A guaranteed place in the team, and a
                paid contract on equal terms with
                Regazzoni for two years.

                          STANLEY
                Are you crazy? Clay's a senior figure
                in Formula One...you're a rookie. The
                only reason we took you ON was because
                you were paying us.

                          NIKI
                Well, as of now, if you want me to
                stay, we rip up the contract. I don't
                pay you a cent.

                          STANLEY
                It's outrageous.

                           NIKI
                Was he quicker in my car? He was,
                wasn't he?

     STANLEY stares...

                          NIKI
                Did he go under two minutes?

                      (quiet)
                  One fifty-six.

                            NIKI
                  So have a think, work out your
                  priorities, and get back to me.

     NIKI turns, and goes. STANLEY stares...

                            STANLEY
                  Not even my WIFE speaks to me like
                  that.


39   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   39

     CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by
     the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe.

     He removes his helmet, then stops.

     In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive
     TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off..


40   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - WORKSHOPS - LOCKER-ROOM - DAY         40

     NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with
     AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees...

     CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks
     English with an Italian accent..

                            REGAZZONI
                  I know what you're going to say. That
                  it's none of my business...

                            NIKI
                  What?

                            REGAZZONI
                  If it's the Track Manager you're
                  taking on your date tonight?

     NIKI immediately becomes defensive...

                            NIKI
                  It's none of your business.

                            REGAZZONI
                  Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd
                  let this one go. I'm not questioning
                  your taste. She's a great girl.

                            REGAZZONI (contíd)
                  But Agnes's last boyfriend was a
                  British Formula 2 driver, who has a
                  reputation for two things. For being a
                  suicidal jerk on the track, and for
                  going all night, and all day
                  afterwards...and all night again in
                  bed. He's an OK driver, but an
                  IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't
                  know about you, but that's not an act
                  I'd like to follow.
                      (shrugs)
                  But if that doesn't bother you...

                            NIKI
                  What's his name? The driver?

                            REGAZZONI
                  Hunt. James Hunt.

     NIKI stares. Can hardly believe it.

                            REGAZZONI
                  See? You share information, I share
                  information.

     CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers..

                            REGAZZONI
                  That's what team-mates are for.

                            NIKI
                      (quiet/defeated)
                  Thanks.


41   EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                          41

     A restaurant in Marseilles. Through the window we can see
     AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER sitting at a table alone.
     Waiting for NIKI.

     Reverse angle to reveal:


42   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ MARSEILLES STREET - SAME TIME                   42

     NIKI is sitting in a car across the street. He stares at AGNES
     in the restaurant. Then starts his car, and drives off.

43   EXT. EASTON NESTON - HESKETH RACING HQ - DAY                     43

     Easton Neston. Set in 3,300 acres, one of England's great
     country houses. Home to the Fermor-Hesketh family since 1700.

     JAMES and a new GIRLFRIEND drive up the gravel drive in his
     anything but grandiose Mini. It splutters to a stop, just in
     time.

     They are greeted by uniformed STAFF who take his tatty bags
     from his filthy car.


44   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY              44

     The Hesketh Racing workshops, situated in the converted
     stables on the estate. HESKETH leads a blindfolded JAMES in...

                          HESKETH
                Keep them closed...! Wait for it, wait
                for it...

     HESKETH removes JAMES's blindfold...

                          HESKETH
                There! What do you say?

     JAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain
     white, no stickers...

                          HESKETH
                Isn't she a beauty? The March 731.
                Converted by the brilliant Doc..!

     DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with
     everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER..

                          JAMES
                She is a beauty. But...haven't you
                made a mistake?

                          HESKETH
                What?

                          JAMES
                That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1.

                          HESKETH
                She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got
                together with the beancounters, and it
                turns out that the economics of F1 are
                not so significantly different to the
                economics of Formula 2...

     BUBBLES clears his throat, dutifully bites his tongue..

                            HESKETH
                  So we thought if we were going to be
                  messing about losing money we might as
                  well be doing it with the big boys.

                            JAMES
                  Are you serious?

                            HESKETH
                  Never been more serious in my life!

     JAMES embraces HESKETH in excitement, kisses him...

                            HESKETH
                  Actually, I got the idea after what
                  you said about the Austrian chap who
                  bought his way in rather than waste
                  his time in the lower divisions. I
                  thought, "Bloody hell, he's right!"

     JAMES slips into the cockpit...

                            JAMES
                  Well done the Goosestepper!!

                            HESKETH
                      (indicates car)
                  No sponsorship, Superstar! I hope you
                  approve.

                            JAMES
                  I do, Patron.

                            HESKETH
                  No vulgar logos for cigarettes, or
                  condoms. Just plain white. With the
                  Union Jack. And racing overalls which
                  read...

     HESKETH indicates JAMES's hanging racing overalls...

                            HESKETH
                  "Sex. Breakfast of Champions." Unless
                  it's me, of course, in which case it's
                  two kippers, porridge, boiled eggs,
                  and half a dozen slices of toast...

     Laughter.

                            JAMES
                  So when do we start?

                            HESKETH
                  Soon as you're ready.

45   EXT. SPANISH GP - RACE TRACK -27 APRIL 1975- DAY                 45

     To establish: a Formula 1 race track on Grand Prix week-end..

     A helicopter comes in to land.

     The Hesketh Racing Team makes a grand entrance with a retinue
     of BUTLERS, GIRLS, ROLLS' ROYCE's, oysters, champagne...

     A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss)
     providing skeptical commentary about Hesketh's debut...

                          STIRLING MOSS
                ...hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh
                and his team of upper class
                enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the
                racing community, or just comedy...

     They walk around in their own branded clothing. Alexander's
     jacket reads, "Le Patron". He speaks to MOSS.

     Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise,
     curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals..

                          STIRLING MOSS
                It's certainly the first time I can
                remember seeing a butler serving
                caviar and oysters in the pits...

     Suddenly pandemonium breaks out. Screams. Something has
     happened. A bad accident on the track. During testing...

                          STIRLING MOSS
                    (holding ear-piece)
                ...reports are reaching me of a
                serious accident that has just taken
                place in qualifying....

     All smiles fade. The party atmosphere changes in a flash.
     Panic breaks out.

     The sound of sirens. Ambulances rushing to the scene of the
     accident. All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off, too.

     HESKETH, BUBBLES and JAMES look at one another, put down their
     champagne glasses, and follow...


46   EXT. RACE TRACK - SPAIN - DAY                                    46

     Mangled wreckage. A car has crashed into (badly installed)
     Armco guard rails, splitting the railing in two...

     The DRIVER has been decapitated. His helmeted HEAD lies
     cleanly severed on the ground...

     A goldfish-bowl of blood.

     It's a horrific accident. People SCREAM and look away. Even
     hardened medical professionals...

     JAMES, HESKETH, BUBBLES arrive on the scene of the accident.
     But they are kept away, at a distance...

                            STIRLING MOSS
                  ...it seems the driver...just twenty-
                  six years old....was killed on
                  impact...and the death toll in Formula
                  1 shows no sign of slowing down...


47   INT. HESKETH PITS - SPANISH GRAND PRIX - DAY                     47

     JAMES, dressed in his overalls, is violently retching. Sick
     with nerves. A TV plays in the pits...

                            COMMENTATOR
                  ...in the last five years alone
                  Formula 1 has lost Piers Courage, Jo
                  Siffert, Peter Revson, Jochen Rindt,
                  Francois Cevert, Roger Williamson...

     ON TV: quickfire clips of the terrible, violent deaths.
     BUBBLES hastily switches off the TV as JAMES walks past...


48   EXT. PADDOCK - DAY                                               48

     JAMES walks out of the paddock, towards his car. Other DRIVERS
     gathered in concerned groups, talking...

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
                  It's terrible.

                            JAMES
                  They should cancel the race.

     Then, a distinctive Austrian accent..

                  Why? No one came to see him anyway.
                  He made a mistake. Went into the
                  corner too fast.

                            JAMES
                  Is that right? So says the nobody who
                  had to pay for his own drive. How's
                  that working out, by the way?

                            NIKI
                  Fine. How's it at the back?

                            JAMES
                  Not planning on being there for long.

                            NIKI
                  Good. Look forward to you showing me
                  the way today.

                            JAMES
                  `Be happy to. I'll have you inside lap
                  one.

                            NIKI
                  Yeah right.

     JAMES walks off to his car, shaking his head..

                             JAMES
                  Asshole.

     NIKI walks to his car, putting on his helmet.

     NIKI is on the podium, spraying champagne. He is wearing the
     victor's garland...

     Meanwhile: JAMES's car is embarrassingly being brought back by
     a tow-truck. NIKI watches from the podium..

     His eyes meet JAMES's..


60   INT. BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT                                         60

     JAMES and BUBBLES and PETER HUNT (JAMES's blazer-wearing
     manager and elder brother), sit together at a table in the
     corner. It's late. A frank post-mortem. Drinking and talking..

                          JAMES
                Niki humiliated me today. He lapped me
                three times.

                          BUBBLES
                He lapped Carlos Pace six times.

                          JAMES
                That's supposed to console me? What do
                I need to do?

                           PETER
                Grow up.

                          JAMES
                Shut up, Moneyman. `Didn't ask you..

                           BUBBLES
                Your brother's right. You've got to
                change your attitude. We all do. And
                match it with a whole different mental
                approach. Professionalism. Maturity.
                Like Niki.

                          PETER
                Bet he doesn't go out every night,
                drink and screw himself stupid.

                          JAMES
                So speaks the jealous married man..

                          PETER
                No. So speaks the manager who's
                wasting his time, making ten per cent
                of absolutely nothing.

                  You've just got to take it more
                  seriously. Yourself more seriously.

                            PETER
                  Something he's never done.

                            JAMES
                  Don`t patronize me, Pete...

                            BUBBLES
                  We need you to spend less time in bars
                  and nightclubs...

                            PETER
                  Make that NO time...

                            BUBBLES
                  And more time with the mechanics,
                  setting up the car. That's what Lauda
                  does. 24 hours a day.

     JAMES rolls his eyes...

                            BUBBLES
                  God knows there's nothing wrong with
                  your talent. Or courage. It's purely a
                  character issue right now.

                            JAMES
                  And the good news is I've got Sigmund
                  Freud Horsely, failed driver par
                  excellence, and a washed-up accountant
                  to lecture me on it.

     The grand Hesketh estate in the Northamptonshire countryside.


68   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY             68

     JAMES is in the workshops, his hands and arms filthy, he's
     been working on the car - but now his eyes are closed.
     Memorizing tracks. Around him people are working on the car..

                          JAMES
                ....along the Beau Rivage, long left
                into Massenet, into the short right of
                Casino. Sharp right into Mirabeau,
                then sharp left into Loews, mind the
                guard rails...

                          VOICE
                Is Alexander around..?

     JAMES opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop-
     dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of SUZY
     MILLER, the most successful model of the day.

                          JAMES
                He was. Then went to the house to take
                a call. He'll be back shortly.

                           SUZY
                Only he wanted to show off his pride
                and joy...

     SUZY indicates the car...

                          SUZY
                ...rhymes with `boy' if you ask me.
                And `toy'. I can't believe what I'm
                seeing.

                          JAMES
                Why?

                          SUZY
                It's just so small! For something that
                costs so much. And so flimsy. There's
                no comfort. No protection. Nothing.

                          JAMES
                No. Just a little coffin, surrounded
                by high-octane fuel, being driven
                round at 170 miles per hour..

                      (becoming grave)
                  To all intents and purposes a bomb. On
                  wheels.

                            SUZY
                  Why don't they make it safer?

                            JAMES
                  No one wants it to be. It's like
                  saying why not make bullfighting
                  safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of
                  death turns people on. Without it, I
                  guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is
                  fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV,
                  fine for everyone..
                      (a beat)
                  ...except us drivers.

     SUZY looks JAMES up and down. Sees the bare feet, the rock
     star good looks...

                  You're James, aren't you?

                             JAMES
                  Yes.

                            SUZY
                  Thought so. You fit the description.
                      (shaking hands)
                  Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

                            JAMES
                  I know exactly.

     In the background: one of the MECHANICS shows DOC a picture of
     SUZY from a tabloid newspaper. She's clearly the most famous
     model in Britain, and a star in her own right...

                            JAMES
                  What was the description?

                            SUZY
                  Mostly positive in terms of
                  appearance. Negative only in terms of
                  character. I've been told to avoid
                  you.

                             JAMES
                  By whom?

                            SUZY
                  Alex. He says you're a bad boy.

                Was. Not any more. New me very
                professional. Early to bed. Early to
                rise. All very dull.

                          SUZY
                Really?

                Round-the-clock work, practise and
                focus. Tedious, but apparently the
                only way to vin against ze
                Goosestepper..

                Is that what you were doing when you
                came in?

                          JAMES
                Visualization techniques. Memorizing
                the circuit, in this case Monaco,
                which is next up. Eyes closed, know

     SUZY laughs..

                          JAMES
                But they don't want me to do that
                anymore...they want my body like a
                temple. My mind like Monk.

                          SUZY
                And your soul? Your heart?

                          JAMES
                What does that mean?

                          SUZY
                You can't be so disciplined in all
                areas of your life, can you..?

                          JAMES
                They want me to stop messing around,
                get married and settle down with the
                next nice girl I meet. They think it
                would be good for me.

                          SUZY
                What do you think?

                          JAMES
                Sounds bloody awful.

     SUZY laughs again...

                           JAMES
                But since they're right about most
                things, they're probably right about
                that, too.

     JAMES looks SUZY up and down...

                          JAMES
                You don't fancy getting married, do
                you?


69   EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - LONDON - DAY                      69

     The sound of ringing bells. London's grandest Catholic church
     in the heart of Knightsbridge..

70   OMITTED                                                          70


71   EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - DAY                               71

     JAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding
     dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church.

     JAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the
     paparazzi cameras. Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and
     BUBBLES.

     They make their way to the waiting convoy of cars...

     On his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC
     POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the
     crowd..

     SUZY is pulled away for photos. Clearly a bigger star even
     than JAMES. JAMES turns to BUBBLES, indicates HESKETH...

                             JAMES
                What's up?

                          BUBBLES
                Nothing. I don't want to ruin your
                day.

     BUBBLES stares, then reluctantly...

                            BUBBLES
                  It seems your revenge against the
                  Goosestepper might have to wait a
                  little longer than you'd hoped.
                      (a beat)
                  He's just been signed by Ferrari.

                            JAMES
                  WHAT??? But that's the best team in
                  the world. They could have ANYONE. Did
                  he pay his way in there, too?

                            BUBBLES
                  Apparently they took back Regazzoni
                  and he insisted they give Lauda a
                  trial. Thinks he's a genius. Setting
                  up the cars...

     JAMES stares...then is pulled away to pose in photographs with
     SUZY and her FAMILY.


72   EXT. FIORANO - NORTHERN ITALY - DAY                              72

     FERRARI's state-of-the-art practise facilities and private
     test-track in Northern Italy.


72A INT. FERRARI CONTROL ROOM                                        72A

     Closed circuit television, with 10 cameras and a complex track
     timing system and computers....


72B EXT. FIORANO - TRACK SIDE                                        72B

     ENZO FERRARI himself, the Commendatore, a formidable white-
     haired patriarch in Onassis dark glasses, reads newspapers,
     sitting by the race tracks, barely looking up as two red
     Ferrari's roar round the track...

     LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, the young, dynamic, aristocratic manager
     of the Scuderia, by contrast, watches eagle-eyed..


72C EXT. FIORANO - TRACKSIDE - LATER                                 72C

     The two cars stop, and NIKI and CLAY REGAZZONI gets out. NIKI
     talks (in a mix of Italian and English) to his MECHANIC,
     giving them typically blunt feedback...

                            NIKI
                  It's terrible! Drives like a pig!

                 Sssshhh! You can't say that!

                            NIKI
                 Why not?

                           MECHANIC
                 It's a Ferrari!

                           NIKI
                 I've driven better milk floats. It
                 understeers like crazy and the weight
                 distribution is a disaster...

     The MECHANIC gulps, then walks over to where the terrifying
     COMMENDATORE and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO are sitting, and passes
     on the information...

                           MECHANIC
                 He says the car is magnificent, a
                 masterpiece, but he has suggestions
                 for one or two minor refinements...


73   INT. FERRARI PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY                             73

     television CREWS from all over the world attending...

     ENZO FERRARI and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO addresses the conference

                           ENZO
                 We are happy to welcome back to the
                 Ferrari family our good friend, Clay

                  You're friend and family to the

                            NIKI
                  I understand. It's business. I would
                  be the same.

                            REGAZZONI
                  But it isn't just business, is it?
                  What we do? It's passion. Love. Which
                  is why we're prepared to risk our
                  lives for it.

                            NIKI
                  Not me. If I thought I had more talent
                  and could earn better money doing
                  something else, I would.

                            REGAZZONI
                  But how do you know you will make
                  money here? You haven't yet.

                            NIKI
                  Not yet. But I will.
                      (smiles)
                  If you can, I can.

     REGAZZONI shakes his head, can't help smiling...

                            REGAZZONI
                  You know, are you ever NOT an asshole?

     NIKI laughs...

                            NIKI
                  Why am I an asshole? You know by now
                  I'm both quicker than you and better
                  at setting up the car. You can't deal
                  with that, then you're the asshole.

                               REGAZZONI
                  Screw you.

     REGAZZONI pulls up outside the house...

                            REGAZZONI (contíd)
                  I brought you along today because you
                  seem like a lonely kind of guy. I
                  thought if I introduce you to some
                  nice people, it'd be good for you.
                  Forget it. Make your own friends.

     REGAZZONI walks ahead, disappears through the front door,
     where he is warmly welcomed, and invited into a party.

     NIKI calls after him...

                          NIKI
                I'm sorry. C'mon, Clay...


76   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NORTHERN ITALY - DAY                        76

     NIKI stares through the window. Inside: a very appealing
     looking bunch - young, good-looking, cool, sexy GUESTS - all
     having a good time..

     By contrast: NIKI catches his own reflection in the glass
     reflection. Pale. Intense. The outsider.

     Inside: REGAZZONI is surrounded by friends, telling a story.
     Everyone laughs.

     NIKI watches. Then turns to walk away. As he goes, the front
     door opens...

     And a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading
     several BAGS into a car. Brunette, tan. Wearing a white dress.

                          NIKI
                Are you leaving?

                          MARLENE
                Yes.

                          NIKI
                Can you give me a lift to the nearest
                town? Anywhere with a train station.

                          MARLENE
                Sure. Nearest town is half an hour's
                drive. Get in.

     The car drives. The radio plays. Marlene sings along. NIKI
     can't help noticing something. He turns down the music.
     MARLENE's smile fades..

                  You hear that noise when you
                  accelerate?

                             MARLENE
                  No.

                            NIKI
                  Your drive belt is loose.

                             MARLENE
                  My what?

                            NIKI
                  Alternator. And when you brake, your
                  foot goes all the way down. Means
                  there's air in the system.

                            MARLENE
                  Anything else?

                            NIKI
                  No. Apart from the rear brakes are
                  imbalanced. The front right wheel is
                  flat, and it feels like a crack in the
                  engine block...which explains why
                  you're drifting so much.

                            MARLENE
                  How can you tell?

                             NIKI
                  My ass.

                             MARLENE
                  What?

                            NIKI
                  God gave me an OK mind, but a really
                  good ass, which can feel everything in
                  a car.

                            MARLENE
                  You don't know what you're talking
                  about. The car is fine. And it just
                  had a service a week ago.

                            NIKI
                  Not a good one.

                            MARLENE
                  A very good one. From a proper garage.
                  It cost a fortune. This car is good as
                  new. Relax.
                                                                          45



79   EXT. MOTORWAY - HARD SHOULDER - DAY                             79

     White smoke pours from the engine. The car has broken down.
     Bonnet up. NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail.

     NIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but
     disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine.

     NIKI's hands are covered in oil. He is pushing a pen into a
     large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease.

                          NIKI
                Nothing I can do here. The car needs a
                garage.

                          MARLENE
                I'm sorry. You're not in a hurry, are
                you?

                          NIKI
                No. As long as I'm back in Maranello
                by Monday morning.

     NIKI walks out into the road. Sticks out his thumb...

                          MARLENE
                So who are you anyway?

     MARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)...

                          MARLENE
                You're from Vienna, aren't you. We can
                speak German. How do you know Curd?

                          NIKI
                Who's Curd?

                          MARLENE
                Curd Jurgens. The actor. It's his
                house. He is, or was until yesterday,
                my boyfriend. I must have been mad!
                There is something very attractive
                about an older man when they behave
                like one. But when they behave like a
                frightened child..

     MARLENE gets to her feet...

                           MARLENE
                C'mon, let me do this. Otherwise we'll
                never get out of here. We're in Italy,
                after all.

     MARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches
     up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs..

     SSSCCCREEEEEEEEECCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!!

     Immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses
     noisily to pull level. MARLENE smiles at NIKI...

                            MARLENE
                  Not bad, eh? Three seconds. Admit it,
                  you're impressed..!

     MARLENE smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young Italian
     MEN driving the open-topped sports car..

                            MARLENE
                  Ciao, Regazzi...!

     But the Italian MEN walk right past her, not seeing her, as if
     she's invisible, and stare at NIKI...

                            ITALIAN MAN
                      (in Italian)
                  Excuse me...are you Niki Lauda?

                            NIKI
                  Yes.

                            ITALIAN MAN
                      (in Italian)
                  Oh, my God...!!! I told you it was
                  him..!!!
                      (blown away)
                  Do you need a ride?

                            NIKI
                  Yes, we do...

     The ITALIAN MAN gestures to his car, as his friend loads
     MARLENE's luggage inside...

                            ITALIAN MAN
                  An honour, please!!! But on one
                  condition..

     The ITALIAN MAN whisper in NIKI's ear. MARLENE stares, not
     understanding, as NIKI protests, but then slowly, reluctantly
     gets into the car. He starts the engine.

     MARLENE watches as the ITALIAN MEN strap themselves in with
     the seat-belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..

                            MARLENE
                  Will someone please tell me what's
                  going on?

     MARLENE turns to NIKI...

                          MARLENE
                Who are you, anyway? What do you DO?

                          ITALIAN MAN
                You don't know? He's a Formula I
                driver. Who just signed for Ferrari!

                          MARLENE
                Him? Never. Impossible!

                            ITALIAN MAN
                Why?

                          MARLENE
                Formula 1 drivers have long hair, are
                sexy, have shirts open to here..

     MARLENE indicates...

                          MARLENE
                Anyway, look at the way he's driving!!
                Like an old man!!

     It's true. NIKI is driving in the slow lane. Like a pensioner.

                          NIKI
                No need to drive fast. It only
                increases the percentage of risk.
                We're not in a hurry. No one is paying
                me. Right now, with zero incentive or
                reward, why would I drive fast?

     MARLENE looks at him with her dark green eyes...

                          MARLENE
                    (in German)
                Because I'm asking you to.

                          NIKI
                    (in German)
                And do you always get what you want?

                          MARLENE
                    (in German)
                Usually.

     NIKI stares, trying to resist...but cannot. He does a
     lightning double-declutch...

     "SLAM", NIKI's foot hits the floor, the engine screams, the
     rev counter flies to the right...

     And the open-topped sports car lurches into warp-drive...

     MARLENE is thrown back hard in her seat, "Jesus", her eyes
     widen in terror and amazement..

                          MARLENE
                Oh, my God...!!

     The ITALIAN MEN scream in excitement, holding on for dear life
     as NIKI, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to
     breaking point, in a way it's never been driven before...

     NIKI overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving
     between cars at twice their speed..

     We CLOSE on NIKI's eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers
     scream all around him, as he accelerates through the other
     cars on the motorway...

     His EYES remain calm, his WHEELS a blur of speed, and we...

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:


80   EXT. USA GP - WATKINS GLEN - 5TH OCTOBER 1975 - TRACK - DAY      80

     Calm EYES, and WHEELS moving in a blur of speed. We're in the
     middle of a Grand Prix, and NIKI is driving at the limit...

     CAPTION: "1975".

     Ahead of him: a familiar sight. The back of JAMES HUNT's
     Hesketh..


81   EXT. PITS - DAY                                                  81

     MARLENE watches on TV in the pits as NIKI is engaged in an
     epic tussle with JAMES...

     Commentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique,
     maturity and performance. But then, "Puff", a plume of smoke
     comes out of JAMES's engine. The engine has blown...

     Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking
     effortlessly. Taking the chequered flag.

     Television commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI
     LAUDA has become world champion...


82   EXT. FERRARI PITS/USA GP TRACK SIDE - DAY                        82

     NIKI's car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant MECHANICS as he
     gets out of his car, removing his helmet, embraced by a
     delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO...

     ...then falling into a passionate kiss with MARLENE...

     Champion of the World, he is immediately swallowed up by
     REPORTERS who are demanding interviews in Italian, German,
     English...


83   EXT. USA GP/PADDOCK - DAY                                       83

     An impromptu party in the paddock area. The victor's garland
     still round his neck, proudly holding the FIA World Champion
     trophy, his hair matted with champagne, NIKI passes through
     the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations..

     He runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is
     pulled away to talk to someone else..

                            JAMES
                  Congratulations.

                               NIKI
                  Thank you.

                            JAMES
                  Though with a car like that, the rest
                  of us never stood a chance...

                            NIKI
                  Maybe the fact the car is so good
                  might have something to do with me.

                            JAMES
                  You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm
                  still in a Hesketh. On equal terms,
                  the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat
                  you, and you know it.

                            NIKI
                  Never. You might get lucky and win one
                  race. Maybe two. Because you're
                  aggressive. But in the long run, over
                  the course of a season, no chance.

                            JAMES
                  Why's that?

                            NIKI
                  Because you're not serious. You're
                  just a party guy. Which is why
                  everyone likes you.

                            JAMES
                  Now try saying that and tell me you're
                  not jealous.

                            NIKI
                  But all that affection, all those
                  smiles is also a sign of their
                  disrespect! They don't fear you.
                  Whereas compare that to me...

                            JAMES
                  Whom no one likes...

                            NIKI
                  Right..

                            JAMES
                  Not even his own team-mates..

                            NIKI
                  Right! Because I'm relentless. I don't
                  screw up. I go to bed early. I look
                  after myself, look after my car. And
                  then, soon as the race is finished, I
                  go home. You should go home more
                  often, too. I heard you got married.

                            JAMES
                  I did.

                            NIKI
                  So where is she?

                            JAMES
                  In New York. Working.

                            NIKI
                  You know I've never seen you with her,
                  once...

     NIKI turns to MARLENE, "Let's go"..


84   EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                        84

     JAMES's Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway
     towards Easton Neston. Screeches to a halt.

     JAMES gets out of the car. Is greeted by staff, whom he
     uncharacteristically ignores, storming past...


85   INT. EASTON NESTON - WORKSHOP - DAY                             85

     JAMES walks into the workshops where BUBBLES HORSLEY is busy
     doing something...

                            JAMES
                  Right, whatever it takes to beat
                  Lauda, just say it, your word is my
                  command. I'll do it. There are no
                  lengths to which I will not go. And I
                  mean it this time...

     JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression...

                            JAMES
                  What's the matter?

     Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He's packing.

                            JAMES
                  What are you doing?

     Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None
     of the usual mechanics, or engineers..

                            JAMES
                  Where is everyone?

     BUBBLES looks up. Unsure how to break it to him.


86   INT. DRAWING-ROOM - EASTON NESTON - DAY                          86

     An old drawing-room. The open fire roars. But HESKETH is
     uncharacteristically quiet. Defeated..

                            HESKETH
                  Do you know what the date is today?

                            JAMES
                  November 14th.

                            HESKETH
                  Do you have any idea of the
                  significance of that date?

                            JAMES
                  I'm assuming it refers to some animal
                  you are allowed or no longer allowed
                  to slaughter on your estate.

                            HESKETH
                  Actually it's the deadline for
                  securing sponsorship for the
                  forthcoming Formula 1 season.
                      (a beat)
                  Which elapsed at midnight last night.
                  And we didn't attract any.

                            JAMES
                  So? We aren't looking for sponsorship.
                  Condoms and cigarettes. Vulgar, right?

                            HESKETH
                  Right. Except we are. Or were. I've
                  made something of a miscalculation.
                  The economics. Formula 1. Reality
                  thereof. Turns out not like the lower
                  divisions at all.

                            JAMES
                  What are you saying?

                            HESKETH
                  I'm saying it's over, Superstar. The
                  banks have stepped in. Read me the
                  riot act. Started laying everyone off.
                  Probably have to sell this place. Fun
                  while it lasted, would do it all again
                  and all that...
                      (ashen)
                  I daren't tell you the actual figures.

     JAMES stares at a devastated HESKETH...

87   INT. JAMES'S FLAT - LONDON - NIGHT                              87

     JAMES is on the phone to his brother PETER, while playing
     Scale-electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...

                            JAMES
                  I need a drive, Pete. Need you to find
                  me a drive.
                      (listens)
                  What does that mean? "My reputation
                  precedes me?"

     "Crash", the electric toy car crashes...

                             JAMES
                      (listens)
                  Really? Is that what they said?
                      (a beat)
                  Did they at least say a "Quick
                  arsehole?"
                      (listens)
                  Bollocks to Lotus. Find me someone
                  else. I'll go mad otherwise.

     "Click", JAMES hangs up. SUZY walks in. Sees his mood..

                            SUZY
                  Don't worry. Something will turn up.

     JAMES opens a bottle of Scotch, pours himself a drink...

                            SUZY
                  But I doubt that will help in the
                  meantime.

     JAMES knocks back the drink...

                            SUZY
                  Why don't we go away for the week-end?
                  Before I leave again for New York?

     JAMES carries on drinking..

                            SUZY
                  Talk to me, James. Don't make a
                  stranger of me.

     JAMES doesn't react...

                            SUZY
                  I can't watch this.

     SUZY picks up her coat, and bag..

                            JAMES
                  What were you hoping for? A well-
                  adjusted knight in shining armour?

                            SUZY
                  No danger of that....

                            JAMES
                  Let me give you some advice.

                            SUZY
                  I'm all ears...

                            JAMES
                  Don't go to men who are willing to
                  kill themselves driving in circles
                  looking for normality.

                            SUZY
                  Well, I certainly didn't get that...

                            JAMES
                  Should have gone for one of my
                  brothers.

                          SUZY
                There goes that self-pity again.
                How striking it is -

                          JAMES
                What's that? Tell me..

                          SUZY
                The gulf between appearance and
                reality. Look at you, all sunshine
                blonde beauty and smiles...yet the
                reality is...a frightened, immature,
                depressed, self-pitying child...

                          JAMES
                At least there's SOMETHING behind the
                facade.

                          SUZY
                With a nasty temper..

                          JAMES
                Fuck off to New York, dear. There must
                be a moisturizer or eye shadow
                somewhere that needs your vapid mush
                to flog it.

                          SUZY
                How quickly beauty can turn ugly.

                          JAMES
                Agreed. Repellent.

     SUZY stares...and goes. JAMES carries on drinking.

     The following morning. The phone rings. Piercing the darkness.
     JAMES, clearly the worse for wear, is talking to his beloved
     budgies...

                          JAMES
                Good girl...

     A surprising vulnerability, and childlike innocence about
     JAMES. He strokes the birds with real tenderness..

     The phone continues ringing. JAMES picks it up...

                  Hello?

     JAMES listens, then hears something on the phone that makes
     him sit up...

                            JAMES (INTO PHONE)
                  Who? McLaren?

     JAMES is waking rapidly now..

                            JAMES (INTO PHONE)
                  Just get me in a room with them, Pete.
                  Say anything. Today? Yes, I can do
                  today.
                      (checks watch)
                  I can be there in an hour.

     JAMES starts scribbling down the address.


91   EXT. MCLAREN HQ - TO ESTABLISH                                   91

     The headquarters of McLaren Racing in Colnbrook, Bucks.

     A small, unassuming building on the Poyle Trading Estate. Bare
     brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade, with the words
     `MCLAREN RACING' in large white letters.


92   INT. MCLAREN HQ - BOARDROOM - DAY                                92

     A large boardroom. Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from
     Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50's - hair turning grey) sits
     at the head of the table.

     Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and
     McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL.

     The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable...

                            MAYER
                  I'll come straight to the point. Our
                  esteemed lead driver...

                            CALDWELL
                  Fitti-fucking-paldi..

                            MAYER
                  Has ditched us for another team at the
                  last minute..

                            CALDWELL
                  In November. Fucking outrageous.

                            MAYER
                  And we need a replacement. Asap.
                  Thankfully a few hands have already
                  gone up. Good people...

                            CALDWELL
                  Like Jackie Ickx.

                            JAMES
                  I'm quicker than Jackie.

                            MAYER
                  But he's consistent, dependable.
                  Sponsor friendly. He'll dress up nice.
                  Say the right things.

                            JAMES
                  What do you want? A driver or a
                  brushes salesman?

                            MAYER
                  We want to be successful.

                            JAMES
                  So do I. But I measure that in podium
                  finishes and beating Niki Lauda not
                  being a show pony for sponsors.

                            MAYER
                  I've heard about this thing with
                  Lauda.

                            CALDWELL
                      (rolls eyes)
                  Everyone has..

                            MAYER
                  You really think you can beat him?
                  He's World Champion.

                            JAMES
                  I beat him in Formula 3.

                            CALDWELL
                  This season alone he's had eight
                  podiums, five wins, you've had what?

                            HOGAN
                  One.

                            JAMES
                  Only because I've been in the wrong
                  car. I beat him when the playing field
                  was level. I'd beat him again in a
                  McLaren.

                It's the only car out there as good as
                the Ferrari. Which is why I'm here,
                begging.

     JAMES stares imploringly..

                          JAMES
                I'll do whatever you ask. Even put on
                a suit, talk to sponsors and say the
                right thing. I promise.
                    (a beat)

   Raised voices debating the width of the car, HUNT furious,
   people almost coming to blows...

                         OFFICIAL
               The car is too wide..

                         JAMES

                         OFFICIAL
               Which makes it illegal! If you want to
               compete, you have to change it.

                         JAMES
               What? You can't just `change it'. That
               means rebuilding the car. Who lodged
               the complaint? It was Ferrari, wasn't
               it?

   The two rival PIT CREWS, (McLaren and Ferrari), scream abuse

   The McLaren MECHANICS, supervised by Alastair Caldwell, are
   making adjustments to the car to make it `legal'..

   smiles, giving `winner' interviews, surrounded by MARLENE and
   a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO.

   JAMES is also giving interviews, but in a total fury.
   Vibrating with anger. Still complaining about the
   disqualification. Complaining about a conspiracy. Complaining.

   NIKI finishes talking to JOURNALISTS, and walks off, through
   crowds, and bumps into JAMES..

                           NIKI
                 So...six races in. How's it going so
                 far?

                           JAMES
                 Fine! Just got a little problem with a
                 bad loser rat and his team of Italian
                 saboteurs who've destroyed my car.

                           NIKI
                 What are you talking about?

                           JAMES
                 I won that race in Spain. And you know
                 it.

                 In an illegal car.

                 The aerofoil was five eighths of an
                 inch too long!! Something that doesn't
                 have the slightest effect on car
                 speed. You complained. Now we've had
                 to totally rebuild the car and it's
                 become a monster.

                 A car that was beating you week in
                 week out, so you have to resort to
                 this. Cheating.

                           NIKI
                 He drives in an illegal car and he
                 calls ME the cheat? Let me tell you:
                 two weeks before that race in Spain,
                 we put 20-inch rims on the rear
                 wheels. We get an extra half second
                 speed on each lap!! But the Old Man
                 tells me we can't use those rims, they
                 make the car too wide. Against the
                 rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims
                 making the car slower again. Rules are
                 rules. For all of us. You're just a
                 bad loser who can't accept that.
                     (tapping head, to MARLENE)
                 Komm, he's crazy. Sick in the head.

   NIKI turns to MARLENE, speaks in German...

                           NIKI
                 Den Trottel lassen wir alleine..
                     (Let's go. Leave this jerk
                      alone.)
                 No wonder she left him...

                 Suzy? Where is she? Wasn't she

                 We kept it from you. Didn't want to
                 tell you before the race...

                 Why have you come here, James?

                           JAMES
                 To get you back.

                           SUZY
                 You don't want me back...you never
                 wanted to be married in the first
                 place. You did it because you hoped it
                 might change you...settle you down...
                 help with the racing. Not because you
                 loved me. And who knows, if it had
                 been just the drinking, or the dope,
                 or the infidelity, or the moods...it
                 might even have worked...but when it's
                 all of them?

                           JAMES
                 I know. I'm terrible.

                           SUZY
                 No, you're not terrible. You're
                 just...who you are...at this point in
                 your life. And God help anyone that
                 wants more.

                           JAMES
                 Will he be able to give you more? He
                 has quite the bad boy reputation
                 himself.

                           SUZY
                 What's important is how it feels to
                 me. And it feels like he adores me.

   A flicker behind JAMES's eyes. Failure.

                           JAMES
                 Right.

                           SUZY
                 He's aware of the delicacy of the
                 situation, and how it looks. Having
                 raided your larder. Plundered your
                 safe. Smash and grab, and so forth. So
                 he's assured me he'll take care of the
                 financial side. And will be very
                 generous.

   JAMES manages a brave smile.

                           JAMES
                 Fine. I'll give him a call.

   again. He manages a brave smile...

                         JAMES
               It's all very amicable. My wife has

   glare of publicity. On the front pages. Being read by everyone
   on the plane.

   A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye. Smiles.


123 INT. JUMBO JET - WC - DAY                                      123

   JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking. Hard.

   Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking
   out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror.
   Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing...

   OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines...


123AINT. FRENCH GP 1976 - PAUL RICARD - 4TH JULY 1976             123A

   JAMES's teeth still clenched. Eyes still burning with anger.
   Driving flat out. At the limit.

   Suzy's words still ringing in his ears.

   Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car
   shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...

   Where death has become a real option.

   Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves
   anyway...

   And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has
   unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an
   advantage over everyone else...

   The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become
   an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared
   to take...

   So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every
   gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...


124 EXT. FRENCH GRAND PRIX 1976 - PAUL RICARD - DAY                124

   The chequered flag waves as JAMES's car roars across the

   JAMES screams with released rage....

   NIKI's car is pursued by JAMES's. They disappear behind a
   copse of trees. Out of sight.

   When they re-emerge, JAMES is ahead of NIKI, having overtaken
   him - to the delight of the partisan crowd.

   The chequered flag waves again as JAMES's car roars across the
   finish line...

   CAPTION: "RACE 8. HUNT WINS. LAUDA 2nd."

   JAMES screams in catharsis and triumph. Teeth clenched. Eyes
   wide and staring with concentration.

   and motoring JOURNALISTS, TV CREWS, etc...

                           FIA OFFICIAL
                 Following an inquiry into the
                 disqualification of driver James Hunt
                 from the Spanish Grand Prix, it has
                 been decided to overturn this
                 disqualification...and to restore his
                 victory, and reinstate his points..


129 INT. MCLAREN HQ - BRANDS HATCH -DAY                            129

   JAMES, TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL, and all the MECHANICS

   Huge celebrations. Cheering and whooping. SCREAMING GIRLS.

131 EXT. BRAND'S HATCH - PRESS TENT - DAY                          131

   A crowded PRESS room. In opposite corners of the room, JAMES
   and NIKI are giving interviews to different PRESS and TV
   journalists. Stirling Moss is talking to JAMES...

                           STIRLING MOSS
                 ...James, a few weeks ago, you were
                 out of the running for this season
                 completely, now you're right back in
                 it. What's changed...?

   Screaming GIRLS in the background, shouting "James, we love
   you." JAMES stares across the room at NIKI...

                           JAMES
                 A combination of factors, not all of
                 which I'm prepared to discuss here.
                 Justice being done re: the
                 disqualification in Spain helps, and
                 having my old car back of course...

   In the other corner: NIKI is doing his interviews in German,
   (we see sub-titles)...

                           JOURNALIST
                 Mathematically in theory it's now
                 possible for Hunt to catch you. Are
                 you worried?

                           NIKI
                 Not at all. For him to catch me, he'd
                 have to win all the remaining races,
                 and I'd have to lose them. And pigs
                 would have to fly.

   Laughter among the confident GERMANS.

                           NIKI
                 Now if you'll excuse me, I have a
                 private family matter to attend to.

   NIKI takes MARLENE's hand, and leads her away.


132 EXT. VIENNESE REGISTRY OFFICE - DAY                            132

133 INT. REGISTRY OFFICE - DAY                                     133

   NIKI and MARLENE get married. In stark contrast to JAMES's
   wedding...it's a small, intimate affair. Modest. Not showy.
   Away from the cameras. Just them. And a witness from the pub.


134 EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                            134

   A small aeroplane takes off...


135 INT. AEROPLANE - DAY                                           135

   NIKI and an INSTRUCTOR are in the plane. In the cockpit. With
   MARLENE, who watches...

   NIKI is learning to fly.

   MARLENE watches as NIKI soaks up the instruction, asking
   questions, happy. It's another side to him, completely.


136 EXT. IBIZA - NIGHT                                             136

   NIKI and MARLENE in a pool. In Ibiza. Playing. Laughing.
   Honeymooning.

   Then NIKI's expression changes. His smile fades.
                                                                         70



137 INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - IBIZA - NIGHT                           137

   MARLENE is fast asleep. She wakes, to discover the bed is
   empty beside her..


138 INT. HOUSE - IBIZA - NIGHT                                     138

   MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI. Then finds
   him on a balcony...alone..

                         MARLENE
               Come to bed.

   MARLENE notices his mood. It's different.

                         MARLENE
               What's the matter?

                         NIKI
               It's the enemy, you know. Happiness.

   NIKI looks up at MARLENE...

                         NIKI
               It weakens you. Puts doubt in your
               mind. Because all of a sudden you have
               something to lose..

   MARLENE stares at him.

                         MARLENE
               When you call happiness an enemy, then
               it's too late.
                   (a beat)
               Then you have lost already.

   MARLENE turns, and goes..

   NIKI is left alone. We can tell from his expression, he is
   struggling with something for the first time. Fear.


139 EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY                                         139

   The notoriously difficult and treacherous German race track.

   Testing is underway. A CAR (from one of the other teams)
   skids, and crashes violently.
                                                                         71

   AMBULANCES arrive. The Driver is badly hurt. Screaming in
   pain. His leg is crushed. Bone is sticking out. A brutal
   compound fracture. He is taken away.


139BINT/EXT. NURBURGRING PITLANE - DAY                          139B

   In the pits, everyone is shaken. JAMES, REGAZZONI, and other
   DRIVERS nervously talk among themselves as the Ambulance races
   past.

   NIKI's face: visibly pale. More frightened than ever.


140 EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY                                         140

   Race-day. Huge crowds arrive at the Nurburgring. And rain.
   Heavy rain falling.

   Television commentary informs us about the Nurburgring's
   terrible reputation as a `graveyard' track.


141 EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY                                         141

   JAMES arrives at the race track, to find ALASTAIR CALDWELL
   waiting for him, a concerned look on his face...

                         CALDWELL
               We've just been told, a driver's
               meeting has been called.

                         JAMES
               Who by?

                         CALDWELL
               Niki.

   JAMES's face. Instantly suspicious.


142 INT. MEETING ROOM - NURBURGRING RACE TRACK - DAY               142

   About sixty people, (26 DRIVERS and all the different team
   REPRESENTATIVES), are assembled in the room, where a blazered
   FIA OFFICIAL and a member of the DRIVERS SAFETY COMMITTEE are
   sitting behind a table...

   A buzz of anticipation and curiosity. What's going on? What is
   all this about? NIKI gets to his feet, raises his hands
   calling for silence...

142 CONTINUED:                                                    142


                           NIKI
                 Thank you. I called this meeting
                 because as all drivers know the
                 Nurburgring is a race track from the
                 Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,
                 outdated, dangerous, track in the
                 world. You've all seen the rain which
                 has been falling this morning. Those
                 of you with experience know the Ring
                 needs perfect conditions to be even
                 remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
                 As you can see today is anything BUT
                 perfect, so I called this meeting to
                 take a vote to cancel the race.

   A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..

                            NIKI
                 There would be no change to the
                 situation as far as points is
                 concerned. The race would simply be
                 cancelled.

   TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....

                           MAYER
                 This is bullshit...

   Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...

                           EDWARDS
                 If the race is cancelled, none of us
                 get our race fees...

                           NIKI
                 It's true. You leave without your fee,
                 but you might leave with your LIFE.

   Another voice pierces the controversy...

                           VOICE
                 It also means you would effectively
                 win the championship.

   It's JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...

                           JAMES
                 So I can see why this suits you just
                 fine.

                           NIKI
                 Why? There would be no points for me
                 either...

                         JAMES
               But there would be one race less where
               I, or anyone else, could catch you.

   Uproar in the room...

                         BRETT LUNGER
               James is right! This is just tactics!

                         ARTURO MERZARIO
               Ferrari's dirty tricks! We've seen it
               before!

                         HARALD ERTL
               Maybe it's just that he's frightened?

   Laughter among the DRIVERS...

                         NIKI
               Which asshole said this?

   Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.

                         NIKI
               Yes, I am frightened. Always a little
               bit when I race. I accept every time I
               get in my car there is 20% chance that
               I could die. But not one per cent
               more. And today, with the rain the
               risk IS more. How dare you accuse me
               of lack of courage? Let me remind you.
               I have the track record here. I am the
               only person in history to do the Ring
               in under 7 minutes. So actually it's
               to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.
               Because I'm quicker than all of you.

   A stunned silence. One voice pierces the room...

                         JAMES
               Fine. Then let's race!

   It's JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and
   enthusiasm among the other drivers...

                         JAMES
               There's a hundred thousand fans out
               there who would never forgive us if we
               didn't.

                         MERZARIO
               And some of us need our race fees!!

               All those in favour of cancelling the
               race?

   NIKI puts his hand up. One or two other racers, too...

                         FIA OFFICIAL
               All those in favour of racing?

   JAMES puts his hand up. Clearly the more popular, charismatic
   figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.

                         FIA OFFICIAL
               Gentlemen, start your engines!!

   A clear victory for JAMES. He has swung the room.

   Everyone leaves the room. JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one
   another a discreet hi-five...

   But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at
   JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.


143 EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                       143

   "RRRROAAAR", an explosion of noise, as we widen and find
   ourselves on the starting grid of the German Grand Prix.

   An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
   Minute"...

   Deafening, angry thunder, as cars rev their engines.


143AAN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                143A

   A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
   Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

   This time the eye belongs to JAMES. He stares up at the
   clouds.

   His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an
   all important decision...

   Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry?

   ALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the

                           CALDWELL
                 Jochen's going on slicks. You want to
                 change?

   JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN
   MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him.

   White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the
   tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over
   at the car beside him...

                           JAMES
                 Has Niki changed?

                           CALDWELL
                 No. He's going on wets.

   NIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS.

                           JAMES
                 Then we go on wets, too.

   JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a
   split-second, then...

   The STARTER waves the flag. They're off!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost
   9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The
   car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black
   scars on the asphalt..

   JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,
   but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,
   gaining fast.

   JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white
   helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.

   MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses
   under his breath...

                            JAMES
                 Shit...!

   JAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs
   to change tyres. With barely one lap completed...

   He swerves angrily into the pits..
                                                                         76



145 INT. PITS - DAY                                                145

   Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
   crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to
   change to dry tyres.

   The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres. Four men with
   air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks.

   ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES..

                         CALDWELL
               See? I told you to go on slicks!! You
               didn't take my advice...

                         JAMES
               Shut up! Where's Niki?

                         CALDWELL
               Behind you! He made the same mistake!

   JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him
   in the pits, then...

   "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac. JAMES gets the
   signal, `Clear!'

                         CALDWELL
               Go! Go!! Go!!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor. He roars out, with new tyres,
   leaving NIKI behind him in the pits...


146 EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                          146

   Archive commentary: from the world's TV stations informs us

147 INT. JAMES'S CAR - DAY                                         147

   JAMES gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,
   breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.

   The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The
   car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No
   thought of failure..

   Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable.

   He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees
   something ahead.

   Flags. Red flags. RACE MARSHALLS. Something has clearly
   happened. An accident..

   The race is being stopped. JAMES brakes, slowing down. He
   pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL..

                              JAMES
                 What's up?

                           MARSHALL
                 Accident. Bad one.

148 INT. NIKI'S CAR - SAME TIME                                     148

   NIKI's POV: a continuation of the opening scene. Burning smoke
   fills NIKI's helmet, burning his lungs. He cries out in agony.

                           NIKI
                 AAAAARRRRGHGHGGHGH!!!!

   We can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the
   other DRIVERS rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in
   the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt...

   We notice it is the same DRIVERS that were critical of NIKI in
   the driver's meeting. HARALD ERTL, BRETT LUNGER, ARTURO
   MERZARIO, GUY EDWARDS...

   Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Covering NIKI's helmet.
   Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and
   fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly..

   The sound of panicked TV COMMENTARY in different languages.
   Screaming voices. Panicked reactions.

   Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK:

   OVER THIS: the hypnotic sound of helicopter blades...

149 EXT. MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY                        149

   NIKI's POV: the door to a helicopter opens, as it arrives at
   Mannheim University Hospital...

   The sound of shouting voices. Hospital STAFF pull reach
   towards NIKI, pull his stretcher out.

   NIKI's internal voice groans: cries out at the pain.

                         NIKI (V/O)
               Some things are better not remembered.


150 INT. MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY                        150

   "Crash", doors burst open and NIKI is rushed into emergency.
   Neon ceiling lights pass overhead...

   The sound of difficult breathing.

   His stretcher is surrounded by DOCTORS, talking urgently,
   making quick assessments..

   NIKI's POV: fading in and out of consciousness.

   Bursts of concerned, urgent, overlapping dialogue among the
   German DOCTORS which NIKI can barely make out..


151 INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - MANNHEIM HOSPITAL - DAY             151

   Two narrow, barely open slits of light. NIKI's swollen eye-
   lids. NIKI's POV: barely making out MARLENE standing beside
   the senior burns specialist DOCTOR. NIKI hears voices...

                         DOCTOR
               It's not the burns to his face that
               are the danger. It's the burns to his
               lungs. His blood oxygen level is
               currently...

                         NURSE
               6.8.

                         DOCTOR
               Which is not enough to maintain
               life...

   NIKI slips out of consciousness again. MARLENE is distraught,
   in tears.

155 INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT                        155

   JAMES sits watching the news on TV in his apartment, while
   feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown)..

   He feels terrible. He goes to his desk, pulls out paper and
   pen...

   JAMES tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to
   put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters
   in particular have never been his thing...

   JAMES scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away. The
   budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..


156 INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY                                 156

   NIKI's P.O.V: feels someone touching his forehead and his
   hands with oil...and the sound of a WOMAN weeping...

                         PRIEST
               ...durch diese heilige Salbung helfe
               dir der Herr in seinem reichen
               Erbarmen, er stehe dir bei mit der
               Kraft des Heiligen Geistes...

   NIKI's eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see
   an ELDERLY PRIEST is giving him the last rites in German..

   The sound of MARLENE crying somewhere in the room.

                         PRIEST
               Der Herr der dich von Sunden befreit,
               rette dich in seiner Gnade richte er
               dich auf...

   NIKI strains to move. A sense of excruciating pain.

   He fights to open his eyes, give an indication...ANY
   indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive
   and able to fight for life...

   But to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites.
   MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI's
   shoulder...

                         NIKI (V/O)
               I'm here! Can't you tell? I'm here!

   NIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them
   a sign. He's OK. He's still there. But it's no use.

   NIKI blacks out again. The pain is too great.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK:


157 INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - DAY                                 157

   Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night
   supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS.

   Niki's MOTHER and FATHER. CLAY REGAZZONI.

   Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a
   DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her...

                           DOCTOR
                 Frau Lauda? Bitte kommen Sie! He's
                 awake! And just spoke!

   MARLENE scrambles to her feet...

                           MARLENE
                 What did he say?

                           DOCTOR
                 "Tell the Priest to fuck off! I'm
                 still alive!!"

   MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears.
   She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit.


158 EXT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY                                 158

   Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI's
   bed. She sees NIKI..

   And gasps. Trying to control her expression. Not give away to
   him how horrified she is.

   NIKI's face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it's
   size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes.

   MARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the
   shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.

   on NIKI in his points total...

   ON TV: the starter's flag drops. Another Grand Prix starts.
   This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands..

   NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum
   pump into his lungs. It's AGONY. JAMES leads, driving the
   perfect race...

                         YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR
               We need to vacuum the lungs. Without
               this, they can't heal. But it will
               hurt.

   An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs,
   to try to hoover out the impurities..

   COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with
   LAUDA on points. It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth.

                         NIKI
               Aaarrrggghhhh...

   The chequered flag. JAMES crosses the line in first position.

   CAPTION: "RACE 12. HUNT WINS."

   The DOCTORS tell NIKI he's had enough vacuum treatment. He's
   had more than enough pain. But NIKI waves them aside...

                          NIKI
               Again!!

   The DOCTOR nods. The vacuum is turned on again.

   NIKI screams in agony. Eyes bulging. MARLENE and NIKI's family
   cannot bear to watch...

   NIKI screams again. MARLENE, NIKI's family and the DOCTORS are
   deeply distressed, cannot bring themselves to watch, as...

                           NIKI
                 Aaaaarrrrggghghhhhhh!!

   We WIDEN to reveal what NIKI is doing. What has caused these
   unbearable, bloodcurdling screams of agony..

                 I know what you're all thinking...

   Now we see. With great difficulty NIKI has put his racing
   helmet on for the first time. Pressing into his open burn
   wounds...

                           NIKI
                 But if you love me - all of you - you
                 won't say a word.

   He is almost unconscious with pain. His legs are weak. But he

   JAMES pushes through the pitlanes, until he reaches the

   name LAUDA on his overalls...

                           JAMES
                 Niki?

   NIKI turns round. JAMES sets eyes on him for the first time.

   JAMES reels, visibly horrified by his appearance. His bandages
   are blood stained. He has no hair. Looks grotesque..

   NIKI sees the horror in JAMES's face. Sees the shock. The
   horror. And recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going
   to be - this is how people will respond to him - forever.

                           NIKI
                 Wow. It's that bad, huh?

   JAMES opens his mouth. Tries to say something.

                           NIKI
                 In the hospital I told them to tell me
                 straight, no bullshit - how bad it
                 would be. My appearance. They said
                 with time it'd be fine. But it won't.
                 I can tell, seeing your reaction. I am
                 going to spend the rest of my life
                 with a face that frightens people.

   NIKI stares at JAMES, at his rival's beauty, his blonde,
   tanned perfection. His matinee idol, movie star looks...

                           NIKI
                 That's a tough one to get used to.

                            JAMES
                 I wrote you a letter at the time. To
                 apologize.

                 The driver's meeting in Germany?
                 Before the race? I swayed the room.

                           NIKI
                 Yes. You did.

                           JAMES
                 That race should never have gone
                 ahead.

                           NIKI
                 No.

                           JAMES
                 So in some ways...I feel responsible
                 for what happened. I'm sorry.

                            NIKI
                 Trust me, watching you win those
                 points and all those races while I was
                 in hospital fighting for my life...you
                 were equally responsible for getting
                 me better.

   Ouch. That could have been meant generously. But in this case
   it wasn't. It was a cold slap in the face.

   NIKI turns and goes.


167 INT. MONZA GRAND PRIX - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY                 167

   A packed press conference. The world's media. NIKI's accident
   and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans.
   This is front page news around the globe..

   NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the
   sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....

   NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on
   both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants
   to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI..

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 How are you feeling, Niki?

                           NIKI
                 Fine.

                           AMERICAN JOURNALIST
                 Can you confirm for us exactly which
                 procedures you have had? And the
                 expectations for your recovery?




                                                          (CONTINUED)

                           NIKI
                 Sure. I had a skin graft operation
                 where they put half my right thigh in
                 my face. It doesn't look too good but
                 one unexpected advantage is it's
                 impossible to perspire through a skin
                 graft, so sweat will never run in my
                 eyes again - which is good for a
                 driver.

   Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in,
   (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.

                           BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST
                 When they heard about your condition,
                 Ferrari immediately hired another
                 driver, Carlos Reutemann.

                           NIKI
                 Ja. Before even my first operation.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 Is he your replacement now?

                           NIKI
                 No. Just another team-mate. Keen to
                 make an impression. So let's see where
                 Mr. Reutemann finishes today.

   Laughter.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 James Hunt and McLaren have caught up
                 a lot while you were away.

                           NIKI
                 Yes.
                     (a beat)
                 Is there a question now? Or are you
                 just trying to piss me off?

   Laughter.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 You think you can still win?

                           NIKI
                 Of course. I have the better car. I'm
                 the better driver. But he's a clever
                 guy and has used the time well while I
                 was lying half-dead in hospital to win
                 some points..

   Laughter.

               What did your wife say when she saw
               your face?

                         NIKI
               She said, "Sweetie, you don't need a
               face to drive. Only a right foot."

   Laughter.

                         BRITISH JOURNALIST
               I'm being serious. Do you really think
               your marriage can survive? With the
               way you look now?

   Silence. NIKI squints into the lights..

                         NIKI
               And I'm being serious, too. Which
               asshole said this? Jesus..

   No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone..

                         NIKI
               Fuck you. Press conference over.

   NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up...

   JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with
   his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves...


168 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS CONFERENCE - SAME TIME             168

   JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him..

                         JAMES
               Hey..!

   The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES..

                         JAMES
               I've got something for you on that
               last question...

   The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls
   out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then...

   "WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then
   takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth.

                         JAMES
               Now go home to your wife and ask her
               how YOU look!!

   "CRASH" a final, sickening blow splits the REPORTER's nose..

                          JAMES
                 Prick!


169 EXT. STARTING GRID - MONZA - DAY                               169

   JAMES walks out to his car. TV CREWS. Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS.
   Commentators talk in different languages.

   Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback.

   NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in
   Italian...

   But NIKI hears nothing. He looks at the steering wheel, the
   shell of the car, the gear stick. And then we see..

   His hands are shaking violently. He's utterly terrified.

   The light turns green. They're off!

   Other cars (including JAMES's), roar forward. But NIKI is
   frozen.


170 EXT. TRACK - DAY                                               170

   NIKI's mind is a mess - terrified - he starts slowly...finding
   his courage..

   COMMENTATORS point out it's madness. It was clearly too soon.
   Ferrari were right to hire a replacement. NIKI is a wreck..

   NIKI suffers terrible flashbacks from his accident...

   NIKI shakes himself out...gradually building up speed -
   ignoring the cars overtaking him all around him...

   NIKI begins to accelerate. Gently at first. Then a bit more.
   Trusting himself. Gaining confidence..

   Blocking out further flashbacks...


170AINT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                           170A

   COMMENTATORS look up. Notice NIKI's slow increase in speed.
   What's this? Maybe there's life in him yet...

   NIKI changes gears smoothly. He begins to overtake. The old
   feelings come back..


170CEXT. PADDOCK/PITS - SAME TIME                                170C

   COMMENTATORS begin to get excited. LAUDA has started to
   overtake the back-markers...

   An incredible sequence. As NIKI gains more confidence, more
   speed, and begins to work his way through the field..

   COMMENTATORS now buzzing with excitement. This is incredible,
   as NIKI overtakes first CARLOS REUTEMANN, the driver hired to
   replace him, then others, working his way through the field...


170EINT. JAMES'S CAR - SAME TIME                                 170E

   JAMES sees NIKI coming up behind him. Cannot believe his eyes.
   JAMES move to block NIKI's path...

   NIKI attacks fearlessly. Despite terrible pain. NIKI moves to
   overtake JAMES.

   Utterly intimidated by NIKI's bravery, JAMES panics, and loses
   control of the car. He spins out..

   COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes. HUNT's blown it!
   LAUDA's overtaken him!

   It's a miracle. It defies belief. As NIKI crosses the line....

   CAPTION: "RACE 15. NIKI 4th. JAMES RETIRED."

   The Italian crowds are ecstatic. Delirious. NIKI is a national
   hero. Lazarus back from the dead. Superhuman.

                 The man was in a coma. His doctors

               What did you expect? That Niki would
               give you the championship lying down?
               Of course not. He's a fighter. He's
               going to come at you with everything
               he's got. But you can do this. As a
               driver, you're his equal - better,
               maybe. And God knows you're quick and
               brave enough. You just..

               Need to find the respect for yourself

               that's the problem, therefore don't
               believe you deserve it.

               I've got to go.

   JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to
   reveal..

   Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart
   blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..

                         STEWARDESS
               Hi. We've come for the party?

                         JAMES
               What party?

                          STEWARDESS
               The party we were told was going on in
               room 2109.

   Sure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109.

                         JAMES
               Who sent you here?

                 A man. On the phone. He didn't give
                 his name.

                           JAMES
                 This man. Did he speak with an accent?

                           STEWARDESS
                 Yes. German accent.

   JAMES can't believe it. NIKI.

                           JAMES
                 I'm afraid it was a joke..

                           STEWARDESS
                     (liking the look of JAMES)
                 Awwww. Pity.

                           JAMES
                 Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not
                 tonight.

   JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then,
   after a moment...

   He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to
   disappear into the elevator...

   The two STEWARDESSES are still asleep in the bed beside him.
   Uniforms discarded on the floor.

   Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING?
   JAMES leaps out of bed.


178 INT. NIKI'S ROOM - HOTEL - DAY                                 178

   NIKI is being massaged by WILLI DUNGL in his hotel room in
   preparation for the race.

   NIKI continues to stare out of the window. They speak in
   German. We see sub-titles..

                           NIKI
                 Can't see the mountain.

                           DUNGL
                 So?

                            NIKI
                 The locals here believe if you can see
                 the mountain in the morning, it brings
                 good luck.

   NIKI's POV: the view. Nothing but mist, dark skies and rain.

180 EXT. JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - FUJI SPEEDWAY - 24TH OCT 1976 -DAY 180

   Inside the race track: puddles everywhere. The rain continues
   to fall. The circuit is covered in water...

   DRIVERS and the TEAMS arrive at the race track. JAMES and
   TEDDY MAYER and ALASTAIR CALDWELL among them...

   SPECTATORS are huddled under umbrellas. TV CREWS struggle to
   keep expensive equipment dry...

   An American VOICE comes over the tannoy...

                           TANNOY
                 All drivers to the control tower,
                 please. Immediately.

   JAMES looks at CALDWELL...
                                                                         93



181 INT. CONTROL TOWER - MEETING ROOM - DAY                       181

   A driver's meeting has been called. All the DRIVERS are in a
   small room, arguing and remonstrating with FIA OFFICIALS and
   blazer-wearing POWERS THAT BE...

   A Japanese official, (AKIYAMA), is trying to keep the peace...

                         AKIYAMA
               One at a time! Gentlemen, please!

   Local JAPANESE DRIVERS are complaining in Japanese, (we see
   sub-titles)...

                         TAKAHARA
               You can't send us out in that! It's a
               death sentence!

                         HASEMI
               You have to postpone the race!


181AINT. CONTROL TOWER - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE - SAME TIME             181A

   JAMES, MAYER and CALDWELL arrive in a corridor outside the
   meeting room...

                         MAYER
               Niki's talking to them about
               cancelling the race.

   JAMES's POV: he can see NIKI, his wounds horribly visible,
   remonstrating with the JAPANESE OFFICIAL about the dangerous
   track conditions...

   JAMES turns to TEDDY and ALASTAIR...

                         JAMES
               I don't want any part of this. I'm not
               going to be responsible for turning
               the room again.

                         CALDWELL
               But you have no option. You HAVE to
               race, James. It's your only shot. If
               you don't, Niki wins..

                         JAMES
               I'm not voting against Niki
               again....or forcing fellow drivers to
               risk their lives. Sorry. World
               Championship or not...

   JAMES raises his hands and walks off. CALDWELL shouts after
   him, "James, wait..!" Then MAYER reassures CALDWELL...

                           MAYER
                 Don't worry, this race is going ahead.
                 The TV rights have been sold all
                 around the world.

   MAYER can see that a vote is taking place in the room. Many of
   the drivers have their hands in the air, voting...

   The JAPANESE OFFICIAL is struggling to keep order in the room.

                           MAYER
                 The drivers can vote all they like.

   A round of applause in the room, as the DRIVERS vote to cancel
   the race. But unseen by the DRIVERS..

   The FIA OFFICIALS, TV NETWORK EXECUTIVES, and the blazered
   POWERS THAT BE are in dark, conspiratorial discussion..

   ...making the decision that the race goes ahead.


182 ARCHIVE TELEVISION FOOTAGE                                     182

   NEWSCASTERS from all over the world, in several different
   languages, announce that a decision has been made..

   The JAPANESE Grand Prix is definitely going ahead. The drivers
   have been called to the starting grid...

184 INT. PITS - VARIOUS - DAY                                      184

   In the pits alongside JAMES...

   A series of shots of the other DRIVERS...being sent out like
   lambs to the slaughter...

   Visibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes,
   meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking..

   Among them the JAPANESE DRIVERS. All laughter gone now.
   Realizing what they've got into. Risking their lives.

   Finally we come to rest on NIKI. Strangely calm.

   NIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing
   with pain as he puts on his helmet..
                                                                        95



185 EXT. JAPANESE GP - STARTING GRID - DAY                        185

   JAMES is piggy-backed to his car by MECHANICS so his feet
   don't get soaked in the water pooling deep on the track.


186 EXT. JAPANESE GP - STARTING GRID - DAY                        186

   JAMES lowers himself into a car with puddles on the seat. He
   straps himself in.

   ALISTAIR CALDWELL approaches with a power-drill. Leans towards
   JAMES, with the screaming drill...

                         CALDWELL
               Keep still...

                         JAMES
               What are you doing???

   `ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", CALDWELL drill holes in JAMES's visor.

                         CALDWELL
               To let the condensation out.

                         JAMES
               But it will also let the water in.

                         CALDWELL
               Not if you're leading.

   CALDWELL stares at JAMES...

                         CALDWELL
               Trust me. This race is all about the
               start. Whoever's in front will see
               everything. Whoever's second...

   CALDWELL gestures, "Nothing"..

                            CALDWELL
               Good luck.

   They shake hands. JAMES starts the engine with a roar.


187 EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                      187

   NIKI's engine replies with a loud roar. He looks over at
   JAMES. JAMES turns to face NIKI..

   ALL SOUND GOES SILENT...

   ...as JAMES and NIKI stare at one another. All around them,
   the world slows down. Comes to a standstill.

   THEIR EYES MEET...

   A connection between them. Unspoken realization of where they
   have both got to. What this moment means. For them both..

   It's what they have been waiting for. Working towards. All
   this time.

   NIKI raises his hand. In a gesture only JAMES sees. JAMES
   raises his in return. A private salute.

   Chivalric. From a bygone era. And in that moment, enemies
   become brothers. Two men. Risking their lives.

   THE TEN SECOND FLAG IS RAISED..

   The moment's truce is broken. They return to the task at hand.

   THE FLAG DROPS. THEY'RE OFF.


188 EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY                          188

   HUNT's foot hits the floor. NIKI's foot hits the floor...

   JAMES gets the better start. His car aquaplanes like crazy,
   skating over the water, totally out of control...


189 EXT. FUJI PIT WALL - DAY                                       189

   CALDWELL and MAYER watch from the pit wall...

                           CALDWELL
                 Hold onto it, James..!


190 EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY                          190

   Miraculously JAMES steadies the car...

   The spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist. The other
   cars are wrapped inside it...

   But JAMES has a clear view ahead. He slams his foot down..

                           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
                 It's the perfect start for Hunt!


191 INT. NIKI'S CAR - SAME TIME                                    191

   Other cars are spinning all around him. It's chaos. NIKI
   bravely accelerates into blindness...

                           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
                 But Lauda's car is right on his tail!

   JAMES goes to a corner, then his car twitches, aquaplanes
   again...badly...almost losing it completely...

                           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
                 Hunt turns too tightly! He almost lost
                 his car right there...!

   maintaining the lead.


194AINT. NIKI'S CAR - SAME TIME                                  194A

   JAMES's spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see. NIKI can't
   blink his eyes...it's agony.

   Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake. Gives it everything he's
   got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears...

   For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur. The
   steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder.

   But the visibility is terrible. The spray tears into his
   scarred eyes. He is unable to see anything but...

   MARLENE's beautiful face: staring at him. Smiling tenderly.
   Kissing him tenderly.

   But there are problems with the car. One of the tyres...

               God! His front tyre! Look! It's
               completely frayed!

   CALDWELL and TEDDY MAYER watch in horror from the pits and on
   TV. They can see the shaking car..

               Hunt's car has problems...it's

   JAMES's car roars past the pits, refusing to stop...

                         COMMENTATOR
               But Hunt is refusing! Simply ignoring
               his team's orders...! He's made the
               calculation that he can still hold
               onto the lead...!

   It's NIKI. JAMES's blood runs cold...

                         JAMES
               No! No! NO!!!!

   JAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But
   his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best...

   ...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM...

   JAMES screams in agony and frustration. He's lost it! And has
   no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And
   stubbornness. NIKI's overtaken him!

   THE CHEQUERED FLAG.

   JAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no
   consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he's concerned..

   JAMES has lost. Lost everything.


200 EXT. PITS - DAY                                                200

   refusing to listen. What a disgrace. What shame. What a fool.
   But he is engulfed. JAMES gets out of his car, raging...

                            JAMES
               I'm sorry!

   But TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly. ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too.
   The world's media descends on JAMES...

                 overtook me!! I saw it!! A Ferrari
                 with a red helmet..

                           MAYER
                 That wasn't Niki. That was Regazzoni.

                             JAMES
                 What???

                           MAYER
                 Niki withdrew. Said it was too
                 dangerous, refused to drive!!
                     (gestures)
                 You're Champion of the World, kiddo!

   TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his
   car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'.

   JAMES's face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness.

200CINT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - SAME TIME                           200C

   BURTON is at the door in tuxedo, waiting to go. SUZY, dressed
   glamorously, smiles.

                           SUZY
                 Well done, James..

   Then turns the TV off. And follows BURTON out.
                                                                       101

201 EXT. FUJI PADDOCK - HELICOPTER - SAME TIME                     201

   Across the race-track, the sound of helicopter blades turning.
   JAMES looks over to see...

   NIKI in the helicopter with MARLENE and a PILOT. NIKI, now the
   ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES
   surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc

                         MARLENE
               Are you OK?

   NIKI turns, takes MARLENE's hand as he answers.

                         NIKI
               Fine. It's just one race.

   The helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off...


202 EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                       202

   JAMES watches as the helicopter carrying NIKI flies away, then
   turns to see...

   ...the world's press begins to descend on him, and the biggest
   party of JAMES HUNT's life is about to begin..

   In the background, the two JAPANESE DRIVERS are giving
   interviews again. They didn't just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI
   got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came
   9th...

   And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the
   snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.


203 A QUICKFIRE MONTAGE                                            203

   Of newspaper headlines, television talk shows, lucrative
   endorsements, TV commercials, sponsorship, public billboards.

   JAMES's world championship victory has made him a rich man.
   His movie star looks make him an international STAR and
   marketing man's dream.

   Girls, more girls, and even more girls.

204 EXT. RUNWAY - DAY                                               204

   We're on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy.

   CAPTION: "THREE MONTHS LATER"

   A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.

   A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy
   FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo...

   They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet,
   passing other jets, when JAMES stops.

   He's seen something that has caught his eye.

   JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and
   walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...

                           JAMES
                 I heard you were spending more and
                 more time in one of these...

   A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It's
   NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a
   painful sight...

                           NIKI
                 Do you fly?

                           JAMES
                 No.

                           NIKI
                 You should try it. If something goes
                 wrong up there, you're on the edge,
                 but have to stay within the rules.
                 Stick to regulations. Suppress the
                 ego. It's good discipline for the
                 racing.

                           JAMES
                 And there I was thinking you were
                 about to wax lyrical about the romance
                 of flight. I should have known better.

                           NIKI
                 What brings you here?

   JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..

                           JAMES
                 A friend's wedding. At least I think
                 it was a wedding. Might have been a
                 birthday. All a bit of a blur. How
                 about you? Been at Fiorano?

                           NIKI
                 Pre-season testing.

                           JAMES
                 Already? In February? You're
                 relentless.

                              NIKI
                 Thank you.

                           JAMES
                 I'm not sure I meant it as a
                 compliment.

                           NIKI
                 But it is one. Relentlessness is good.
                 Means you're a fighter. That you never
                 give up. Behind my back I know some of
                 you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I
                 look like one. It's meant as an
                 insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are
                 ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But
                 they're intelligent. With a strong
                 survival instinct.

   JAMES can't help smiling. That's NIKI.

                           NIKI
                 So when do you start testing? Next
                 week?

                           JAMES
                 Are you mad? I didn't just win the
                 biggest thing of my life so I could
                 get right back to work.

                           NIKI
                 Why? You need to. To prove to all the
                 people who will always say you only
                 won it because...

                           JAMES
                 Because what...? Because of your
                 accident? Is that other people, Niki?
                 Or you? I won. On the all important
                 day when it came down to it, we raced
                 on equal terms in equally good cars.

                         JAMES (contíd)
               You bottled and I had the guts to see
               it through.

                         NIKI
               It's true. You won that race. And
               believe me if I had to lose that title
               to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But
               that doesn't change the fact you have
               to win again.

                         JAMES
               Why?

                         NIKI
               Because that's what it means to be a
               winner, no? It's a permanent
               condition. Never stops or goes away.
               It stays with you always.

                         JAMES
               That's winning? Sounds like losing to
               me. Some of life needs to be for
               pleasure, Niki. What's the use of
               having a million cups and medals if
               you never have any fun? How is that
               winning?

   The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."C'mon, James!"

                         NIKI
               You're right. I could learn from you.
               In hospital the toughest part of my
               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the
               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.
               While doing it, I was watching
               television...you winning all those
               races...and I was cursing you.. "That
               bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate
               that guy." one day the doctor said,
               "Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of
               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse
               to have been given an enemy in life.
               It can be a blessing, too." I said,
               "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A
               wise man gets more from his enemies
               than a fool from his friends." And you
               know, he's right. Look at us. We were
               a pair of kids when we first met.
               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed
               nowhere. Now we're both Champions of
               the world. Not bad.

                         JAMES
               No, not bad.

                         NIKI
               So don't let me down now. I need you
               busting my balls. Get back to work.

                         JAMES
               I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy
               myself first. And so should you. You
               think you can?

   NIKI stares. A blank look..

                         JAMES
               See you on race day, Champ.

                         NIKI
               You will. Champ.

   JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his
   laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his
   eyes.

   Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.


205 EXT. RUNWAY - AIRFIELD - DAY                                  205

FADE IN:

EXT.  LOS ANGELES - DAY

The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the
summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and
wake me up.

EXT.  LAX - DAY

The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly
with stretch limousines.

INT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY

Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers
and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the
crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of
Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

				REPORTER
			(to TV CAMERA)
		Eager to mend its tarnished image,
		Los Angeles has really put out the
		welcome mat for tomorrow's summit.
		The city promises quite a party as
		leaders from Japan, China, South
		Korea, Australia, the U.S. and
		others begin talks for the largest
		free-trade treaty in history.

The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries
arriving.

Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		The one sour note is North Korea,
		the only Pacific Rim country not
		participating. There are rumors of
		secret meetings with North Korean
		representatives, but U.S. officials
		insist the North must first hold
		democratic elections, and halt its
		nuclear weapons program -- as they
		claimed to have done back in 1995.

We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.

The SCENE returns to LAX.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		Tensions remain high since last
		year's skirmishes between North Korea
		and the U.S. So any chance of the
		communist North joining the Pacific
		Partners seems highly unlikely.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only
one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
     
				Consulate
				 of the
		Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

BACK TO SCENE

The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

NEW ANGLE

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

				SAM
		I can't stand it -- half an hour to
		get to the stupid school every
		morning... with no music...
			(Korean; subtitled)
		[Just our damn Nanny...]

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS

Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

WIDER

Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

				DRIVER
			(Korean)
		[Stay in the car.]



EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

ANGLE WITH JAVAL

as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

							FADE TO:



EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

							CUT TO:

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

				CARSON
		Son of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

				MIRANDA
		Pete... please... we have to be up
		early tomorrow. Call the police.



				CARSON
		Yeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Shit!

MIRANDA

pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

				MIRANDA
		Not again...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

NEW ANGLE

Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

				WESTEC GUARD
		Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
		the ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

				CARSON
		Asshole was trying to boost my car!

ANGLE ACROSS STREET

Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

				CARSON
		Mike -- call 911!

				NEIGHBOR
		Been trying...
			(has a cordless phone)
		It's busy.
			(to Guards; re Carson)
		He's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

CLOSER

Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

				JOY
		There are six bathrooms in this
		house, Sam.

				SAM
			(fanning the air)
		But only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(Korean)
		[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing)
		[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

				MRS. HAN
		It's the Governess...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Hilda...

CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS

as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

				GOVERNESS
			(thru phone)
		Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We will see you next week...
			(hangs up; smiles to kids)
		It appears I'll be taking you to
		school.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

				JAVAL
		Very good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY

Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

ANGLE ON TV

A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
		gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
		July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
		rolled into one! All over town
		there'll be parades, concerts,
		rallies, festivals... So get out
		there everyone, but plan your drive-
		time accordingly! This is Bobbi
		Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

				MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
			(on TV)
		The President is on his way...

				PRESIDENT
			(on TV)
		...It's an honor hosting my fellow
		leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
		city of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

				MORNING ANCHOR
			(on TV)
		We'll see the menu for Mayor
		Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
		after this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

BACK TO SCENE

As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

				MIRANDA
		I was watching that.

				CARSON
		If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
		I'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

				CARSON
			(continuing; while smiling)
		I said, if we were having sex once in
		a while, you wouldn't need to ride
		that fucking bike every morning.



				MIRANDA
			(hasn't heard a thing)
		Be right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY

Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

				MIRANDA
			(looks him over)
		Have you gotten any sleep lately?

				CARSON
			(ignores the question)
		Shop's gonna tow the car in --
		goddamn ignition's trashed.

				MIRANDA
		Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

				CARSON
		You ask me, those suckers are a lost
		cause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

				MIRANDA
		It's not for you.

				CARSON
		You mean it's not for you.

				MIRANDA
		I don't chase car thieves in my
		underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
		boredom if we ever sold this house
		and moved.



				CARSON
		I'd die of shock, from finding
		anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
		Even for what it's worth now.

				MIRANDA
		Lots of people bought at the top of
		the market...

				CARSON
		That sure cheers me right up.

				MIRANDA
		I don't know why we even talk about
		it. The city's not the problem. So
		we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
		that saying: "Wherever you go, there
		you are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		I hope you're current on your
		tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

				CARSON
		One cut... two assholes in the
		hospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Well, another day of baby-sitting my
		favorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

				MIRANDA
		Ask for a transfer.

				CARSON
		They're not gonna transfer me. You
		know damn well why I was bumped down
		to guard duty...
			(as he's leaving)
		My outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY

A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
SWEARING:

				ANGRY VOICE (OS)
		Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
		shit...

THEIR POV

In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

JOY

turns to Mrs. Han:

				JOY
		Can we give Lisa a ride?

INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY

It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

				LISA
		Hey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



				LISA
			(continuing)
		Excellent -- I can't hear him!

				SAM
			(raps on window)
		The glass is an inch thick.
			(points to doors, roof)
		Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
		proof.

				LISA
		Perfect car for L.A.
			(looks back at her Dad)
		Starts, too.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.



				ROBBINS
		Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
		escaped the office!

				DAVE
		I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
		a chance to hose out my cage.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

				ROBBINS
		Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

				SABATINI
		"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
		call him.
			(yawns; flops in a chair)
		Friggin' graveyard shift...

				ROBBINS
		Love to know what dope made it the
		Bureau's job to give full-time
		protection to foreign consulates.
			(offers coffee to Dave)
		Cup a mud?

				DAVE
		Not if you made it. Why don't you
		get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
		the alleged chick.

				SABATINI
		Blow me.

				DAVE
		Where's Carson?

				SABATINI
		On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
		off his Mustang last night.
			(beat; solemnly)
		They cut the ragtop.

				DAVE
		Motherfuckers...

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.



				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Latest and greatest. Wireless
		network link-ups.

				SABATINI
		Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

				ROBBINS
		Me, too.

				DAVE
		Ingrates.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY

The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



INSERT

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

WIDER

The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



				JAVAL
		You see that I'm serious in my
		intention, yes?
			(she nods)
		If you cooperate, you and your
		children will be home for dinner
		tonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

				COLONEL LEE
			(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
		[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Someone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



				SABATINI
		You got no jurisdiction outside
		this property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

				SABATINI
			(continuing)
		Shit!
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Yank his fuckin' leash!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		My men are going!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing; to Sabatini)
		It's a white telephone van, driving
		west on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

				ROBBINS
		Keys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

				SABATINI
		You're ridin' shotgun.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

				ROBBINS
		Cherry?

				DAVE
		Under the seat.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

				ROBBINS
		Siren?

				DAVE
		I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
		hurry..!



EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

				SABATINI
		Someone snatched Han's family! White
		phone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

				CARSON
		Give me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

				CO-WORKER
		Someone's been to Nordstroms, big
		time.

				WALTHER
		Clothes make the man.

				CO-WORKER
		But does the man make enough for the
		clothes?

				WALTHER
			(smiles)
		The man makes payments on his Visa.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.



				SECRETARY
		Mr. Walther... priority line!

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
		Walther... What's the nature of your
		emer --
			(grimaces)
		Aw, Jesus... not today...
			(beat)
		I'll inform channels and get a copter
		in the air. For God's sake, keep it
		quiet. Do what you can, but don't
		endanger civilians or the family!

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		You bet -- nice and easy.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Get the Secretary of State on the
		horn.
			(listens)
		I know he left already. I'm familiar
		with the concept of time zones. Find
		his ass.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on
		its way.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.



INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Think it's them?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll
		move up; he won't suspect a civilian
		car. Stay back, then get on his ass
		when I signal. We'll box him in.

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		If the Mod Squad gets in your way,
		don't be shy about getting 'em out.

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Copy that one.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

				SABATINI
		Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

HIS POV

As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



JAVAL

grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

				JAVAL
		I need to concentrate!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

NEW ANGLE

The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY

Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's gonna wrap it around something!

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



NEW ANGLE

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

				COLONEL LEE
		You should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

				CARSON
		I'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

				ROBBINS
		Forget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY

A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing
that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.



				CARSON
		Let's get back to the Consulate.

Off their perplexed looks, we

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

				JAVAL
		Does anyone need to use the rest
		room? This will be your last
		opportunity for a few hours.
			(no takers)
		Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,
		please sit here.
			(indicates the Lazy Boys;
			then turns to Lisa)
		And you... what is your name?

				LISA
			(after a beat)
		Lisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

				JAVAL
		No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

				JAVAL
			(continuing; sotto)
		You afford me some additional
		bargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		There. No taping your mouths, no
		restraints. Please remain still
		while I explain. The meters on the
		left indicate sound pressure --
		Decibels. There are microphones on
		your chair backs. If you raise your
		voices above certain level, putting
		your meter in the red zone for more
		than one sustained second, the
		circuit will be closed.
			(beat)
		The right meters indicate motion.
		There are pressure sensors inside the
		armrests and seats. The sensors don't
		like to get wet, so I hope you were
		honest about not needing to use the
		loo. If you make any excess
		movements, or try to leave your
		chair, the circuit will be closed.

				MRS. HAN
		I don't understand...

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

				MRS. HAN
			(continuing; softly)
		What happens if the circuit closes?

				JAVAL
		Kaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Easy... deep breath...
			(to the kids)
		Do each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(on TV)
		...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
		whole city had an such an opportunity --

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

				WALTHER
		Carson?
			(Carson nods)
		Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

				CARSON
		His Security Chief.
			(beat)
		There was a civilian with them --
		fifteen-year-old girl from across
		the street. We're trying to reach
		the parents.

				WALTHER
		Goddamn it...
			(sotto)
		Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
		Premier's niece! We're hearing
		rumors they're gonna make a major
		issue out of what happened here...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

				CARSON
		I'm not so sure what happened here.
		Something smells. Asshole was acting
		like he wanted us to spot him...



				WALTHER
		What the hell are you talking about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		Mr. Walther?

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.

				WALTHER
		Ambassador Han... my deepest --

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		-- I have no wish for condolences.
		Just answers.

				WALTHER
		As soon as we have any to give...

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		Yoon..?!

				CARSON
			(to FBI agents)
		Start a trace!

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Carson; incensed)
		You are tapping our phones?!

				CARSON
			(while crossing to
			Ambassador Han)
		Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
		Streep.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.



				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We are not hurt. But this man is
		very serious --

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

				JAVAL
			(into phone)
		I want you to remember the feeling
		you had when you thought your family
		was dead, and use it to inform the
		choices you're about to make.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

				CARSON
		Say you want to talk to the kids...

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		I need to know my children are all
		right.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Be in front of a television in two
		minutes. Tune it to channel four.
		You'll get the picture.

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There is a television in my office.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're screwed on the trace -- he's
		on a cell phone.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

				DAVE
		Play the tape back. I might be able
		to pull the electronic serial number
		out of the subcarrier.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Ask Dave if he knows how to find the
		phone's serial number.

				ROBBINS
			(smiles; into radio)
		Hey, great idea...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

ANGLE ON TV

It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

CLOSER

There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
			(beat)
		Look at the TV -- this was just
		taken.

BACK TO SCENE

A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.



				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		There must surely be several people
		in the room; you may put me on the
		speakerbox if you wish.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(continuing; thru
			speakerbox)
		I am not a terrorist. Your
		countries' political posturing means
		nothing to me. So do not waste time
		trying to negotiate.
			(beat)
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
		Angeles can furnish ten million
		dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
		required denominations are in the
		instructions, as is the method of
		packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
		PM, and drive north on Highland
		Avenue. I will call with where to
		leave the money, which you will do
		at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
		call again at 4:00 with the family's
		location and the method for removing
		them from their... predicament.
		Could you please refer to page one?
			(they look at the photo)
		Any deviation from these instructions
		and my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Walther)
		P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

				WALTHER
		Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
		Negotiator is on the way --

				CARSON
		-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
		thing we need! This asshole sound
		like he was interested in bargaining?

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:


				WALTHER
		We have people who are experts in
		these situations. We really feel it
		would be best if you let them
		coordinate everything...

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

				WALTHER
			(continuing; to Carson)
		Let's get on it...

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

				CARSON
		...You're gonna just pay up, count
		on his good nature to return the
		family?!

				WALTHER
		It's the President's intention to
		keep this quiet, move forward with
		the Summit, and work with the North
		Koreans. Jesus, you've already
		embarrassed the shit out of us over
		the phone surveillance --

				CARSON
		-- They know their phones are tapped!
		They tap our fucking phones!

				WALTHER
		That's not the point! The point is
		not acknowledging it!
			(beat)
		We got an international incident
		brewing, with a country we were
		practically at war with last year!
		Our best Negotiator is gonna run
		point. If you got a problem, you can
		take the goddamn rest of the day off.

				CARSON
		This Consulate is my responsibility.

				WALTHER
		Not any more.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.



				WALTHER
			(continuing)
		That's the Negotiator. You do the
		briefing.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

				CARSON
		...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
		There are events gearing up all
		around town, and a dozen world
		leaders arriving. Add the Friday
		rush hour and usual L.A. bad
		behavior and it'll be a nightmare
		out there by 3 PM. It all works to
		the advantage of the kidnapper,
		hinders our pursuit efforts...
			(frowns)
		You don't agree?

WIDER


The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.


It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.

				MIRANDA
		I'm wondering whether to believe him
		when he says he's strictly motivated
		by money.

				CARSON
			(grabs faxes back)
		You see one word of Peoples'-
		Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
		whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
		this-week bullshit in this entire
		letter?

				MIRANDA
		I still want to check the MO against
		known politicals, terrorists --



				CARSON
		-- Already doing it. We're
		coordinating with the Secret
		Service, the NSA and the CIA.

				MIRANDA
		Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
		them a cover story for the media
		about the crash on La Cienega.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

				WALTHER
		Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
		is your wife?!

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

				CARSON
			(while looking at Miranda)
		If she'd changed her name when we
		got married, I wouldn't have to.

				MIRANDA
			(to Carson)
		I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
		finally work together...

				WALTHER
		Jesus, forget I asked.
			(beat)
		The cash will be here in an hour.
			(to Miranda)
		Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
		thoughts?

				MIRANDA
		Everything indicates he's working
		alone. And his concerns do seem to
		be solely about the money... so I
		agree that he's only using the
		Summit and the tension with North
		Korea to create extreme motivation
		to pay the ransom.

				COLONEL LEE
		I will bring the money to him.

				CARSON
		My ass.

				COLONEL LEE
		The hostages are citizens of the
		People's Republic of Korea --

				CARSON
		-- Hey, do I go to the torture
		chambers in your prisons, tell you
		how to do your job?

				WALTHER
		All right, you're outta here! Is
		this the same insubordinate crap you
		pulled at Beverly Thrift?

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

				CARSON
		I'll coordinate the drop.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Perhaps that is better. Inspector
		Carson knows the terrain --

				COLONEL LEE
		-- Then he can come with me.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

				WALTHER
			(firm; to Carson)
		It's settled.

				CARSON
		It sucks.

				MIRANDA
		But it means we can get on with it.

The Americans leave the room.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

				MIRANDA
			(sotto)
		Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
		If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
		Beverly Thrift never would've
		happened.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

				JAVAL
		That's more like it...

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

				OPERATIVE
			(into uplink device)
		...They've got the Premier agreeing
		to the hard-line position --

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

				OPERATIVE
			(continuing; sotto)
		More to follow...

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

				DAVE
		I wanted to be home by now, take the
		kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

				SABATINI
		We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
		L.A. was supposed to be a brown
		blotch in the rear-view mirror.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

				MIRANDA
		He'll expect a homing device --

				CARSON
		-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
		check the cash with an RF detector...
			(re larger transmitter)
		Meaning he'll find this one.
			(re smaller transmitter)
		This only has a quarter-mile range,
		but on a frequency too low to detect.
			(turns off receiver)
		And I doubt the asshole will have an
		X-ray machine or a metal detector.

				MIRANDA
		Why must you always refer generically
		to criminals as "assholes?"

				CARSON
		Gosh, you're right. It could
		undermine their self-esteem and spoil
		their chances for rehabilitation.

	
				MIRANDA
		You been reading my magazines in the
		bathroom again?

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru recorder)
		"And my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

				MIRANDA
		He's really exhibiting pressured
		speech... big effort here to sound
		calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
		he were in control, he wouldn't feel
		such a need to sound that way.

				CARSON
		Just tell me if we can use it.

				MIRANDA
		If we needle him he could get sloppy
		and give us an opening, but I'm not
		going to risk it. This is the worst
		kind of perpetrator: anything makes
		him deviate from his carefully-
		scripted plan, he could become
		extremely volatile.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Do we have back-up if the bleeper
		fails?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Nothing but physical surveillance.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

				MIRANDA
		It's real important we don't lose
		him. He didn't go through all the
		trouble of designing that bomb not
		to use it.

Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.



				CARSON
		Well, it ain't gonna happen.
			(beat; sotto)
		Not again...

EXT.  WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF
DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit
nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.
The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell is the big crisis?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		We just received a missive from the
		North Korean attachÈ. They say the
		kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
		and humiliate them during the Summit.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Bullshit. They're just ticked because
		we don't want the Chinese dragging
		their asses into the treaty talks.

The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		We have a covert operative in place.
		He reports the hard-liners and
		moderates in the High Command are
		arguing about how to respond, should
		the Premier's niece and her children
		should be killed.

				PRESIDENT
			(scowls; thru video link)
		Respond?! Christ. What about the
		damn Premier?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		He's weak. He has to look tough to
		save face, keep control of hard-
		liners... otherwise he risks a coup.

				CIA CHIEF
		Which is a real possibility. Most of
		those old-fart Generals don't want to
				-more-

				CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)
		be part of the Summit any more than
		we want them to. They're mad as hell
		he even talked to the Chinese.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't want to deal with this right
		now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell
		the North we'll pay the ransom for
		'em... Placate 'em! And make damn
		sure we get that family back in one
		piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?

				FBI CHIEF
		The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack
		team in place.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		There's a Diplomatic Liaison from
		State, too.

				CIA CHIEF
			(to FBI Chief)
		What about your man stationed at the
		Consulate...
			(refers to notes)
		Carson? He was demoted from the FBI
		Hostage Program, couple years back.
		And this did happen on his watch...

				FBI CHIEF
			(irritated)
		There's no way he could've prevented
		this abduction! Besides, I've got one
		of my top Negotiators in charge --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- Whatever. I want a total news
		blackout and I want this over with,
		quickly! Without giving those Commie
		little bastards any excuse to shit
		all over my Summit!

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the
driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is
already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is
completely in the car.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town
is all done up with posters and banners.

Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an
unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag
Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the
two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		Yes, please go ahead...

				JAVAL (VO)
			(long beat; thru phone)
		Ah... this must be one of those

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)

Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Must've bought a house same time we
		did.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland
near Hollywood Blvd.

Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising
around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.

A BIKER CLUB

of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn
from the Boulevard onto Highland.

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood
Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a
sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.

Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money
from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the
pavement. Carson looks around.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		There's about a hundred ways he can
		scurry off like a cockroach from
		here... So spread out.

Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs
a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,
smacks his arm and points ahead:

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above
the bags of money.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream
		truck!

EXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY

Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector
wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them
makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY

The van pulls away.

Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.
He looks up...

Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.

				DAVE
		Son of a bitch!
			(into radio)
		He found the bleepers -- both of
		them!

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like
		he'll be hard to see in that truck.
		Which way's he heading?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Toward the freeway.

Carson hangs a U-turn.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,
Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		What happened?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're made! Gotta grab him!

				MIRANDA
			(beat; into radio)
		All right... Carefully...

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.

				CARSON
		Watch it! We need him alive!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.

				COLONEL LEE
		Turn around!

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

				CARSON
		FBI. Call our office, they'll take
		care of you.

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

				BIKER
		I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
		dentist!

COLONEL LEE

gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

WIDER

When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

				CARSON
		Just don't kill yourself, you piece
		of shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Helicopter or two would be nice!

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Love to be in the loop on this...

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Not just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

				CARSON
			(continuing; grumbling)
		I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
		horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

JAVAL

speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's on foot, at the base of the
		elevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

CLOSER

From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

BEHIND CARSON

the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

NEW ANGLE

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

				CARSON
		Fingerprint it.
			(to Walther)
		He's not gonna tell us where to find
		the hostages...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(looks at watch)
		Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
		figure it out for ourselves.

				WALTHER
		Figure it out?! With what?!

				CARSON
			(ignores him; into radio)
		Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
			(to Robbins)
		Get back to his van. There were no
		plates, but check the VIN, look it
		over, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Go!

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		...Scrounge us some bodies: National
		Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
		PD's, meter maids --

				WALTHER
		-- They're gonna search the whole
		city in a goddamn hour..?!

				CARSON
		Look, I don't need you to tell me
		how fucked we are!

				WALTHER
		Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
		case something explodes!

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

				MIRANDA
		Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
		is a luxury we can't afford!
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
			(looks at Carson)
		What's done is done. There'll be
		plenty of time to point fingers
		later.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

				SABATINI
		I need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		This is impossible! How can you even
		begin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

				MIRANDA
		Well, the normal procedure is to
		negotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

				CARSON
		Let's take stock. We've got a picture
		of where he hid the family, and
		recordings of his calls --

				MIRANDA
		-- That's right! We can send them to
		our experts for analysis...

				CARSON
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Same with his fingerprints. But that
		means we need high-quality image and
		data transmission. We can piss away
		ten minutes coptering this shit to
		our offices in Westwood, or we can
		use your surveillance equipment.

				COLONEL LEE
		There is no surveillance equipment.
		This is a diplomatic facility --

				CARSON
		-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Take them upstairs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

				CARSON
		South Korean Consulate's just down
		the street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

				CARSON
			(continuing; re hand)
		Shitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
		Got a digital scanner?

				COLONEL LEE
		Analog.

				CARSON
			(looks equipment over)
		You might want to drop a few bucks at
		Radio Shack and get with the decade.
			(into radio)
		Dave -- get in here. Bring your
		computer, a city map, and the tapes
		of the ransom calls.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		On my way...

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



				MIRANDA
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
		him to the Ambassador, see if it's
		anyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
		of prints coming over. Narrow the
		search criteria: Male, thirties,
		Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
		maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and
		bombers first. We need an answer in
		fifteen minutes.

EXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

FBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g.

INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY

A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high-

		That yellow air out there finally
		rot your brain?! It's impossible!

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Dazzle me.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		We got one of the best sound guys
		right here in town...
			(into phone)
		Newman in Audio Analysis...

				DAVE (OS)
		Newman's gone.

WIDER

Dave comes into the room.



				DAVE
		He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
		bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

				DAVE
			(continuing; looks around)
		Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
		to see the fight tonight.

				CARSON
		Get those tapes transferred to a
		sound guy. We need ambient and
		background analysis, the whole
		enchilada.

				DAVE
		Enchilada -- you saying that because
		I'm Mexican?

				CARSON
		No... 'cause you're fat.

				MIRANDA
			(picks up Javal's fax)
		Photo enhancement... Isn't there
		some amazing tech with the LAPD --

				DAVE
		-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
		PD a month ago.

				CARSON
		Jesus H. Christ...

				SABATINI
		I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
		earn their keep.

				CARSON
		Do it.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.

				MIRANDA
		Given his behavior, this orange
		residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
		Amphetamines.

				CARSON
		Any significance?



				MIRANDA
		It's consistent with the lone wolf
		scenario: A handful of these is pure
		bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
		psychosis and paranoia kick in.
			(beat)
		We could check pharmacy records, on
		the remote chance he got them
		legally... if we had a couple of
		weeks, that is.

				CARSON
			(to Sabatini)
		Get the Bureau on it.

				MIRANDA
		Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

				CARSON
		Look, goddammit, you start skipping
		no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
		quit and go to the beach right now.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
		last certain visual we had was just
		before his van went into the alley
		on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
		Consulate at 9:30.

				MIRANDA
		That gives him about fifty minutes
		to get to his location, move and
		secure the hostages, and activate
		his time bomb.

				CARSON
		He probably waited a while to pad
		the time -- he wanted us know the
		family was still alive...
			(sotto; re Koreans)
		...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
		throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
		but he didn't want to call too soon,
		either. I say they're within 15 to
		20 minutes, via surface streets, of
		where we last saw them.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.



				MIRANDA
		The most densely-populated part of
		the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
		to about 200,000 dwellings.

A beat while this sinks in.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		He was traveling west --

				CARSON
		-- Bet he doubled back.

				MIRANDA
		C'mon, that's total conjecture --

				SABATINI
			(re Carson)
		-- I'd trust his instincts when
		dealing with maniacs. He is deeply
		disturbed.

				MIRANDA
		You're telling me?

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
		accusing us of botching the ransom
		drop on purpose.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They're still harping on that
		"American plot" nonsense.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Meaning?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They say the death of the Premier's
		niece and her family would justify
		immediate retaliation.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
		What kind of retaliation?

Everyone in the room looks at one another.



				CIA CHIEF
		They're threatening to pull a Saddam
		Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
		at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
			(beat)
		They're talking about firing a
		missile into Los Angeles --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- A goddamn WHAT??

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
		cruise -- their version of our
		Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
		find the city, but it's not too
		accurate beyond that.

				VICE PRESIDENT
		Still, for their purposes it's
		perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
		out a city block or two...

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		To the eyes of the world it's a
		measured response -- like what Reagan
		did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
		at an American city would be a huge
		psychological victory for them.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't believe I'm hearing this!
			(beat)
		So if we know it's coming, we can
		knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		These weapons fly subsonically, below
		radar... we don't have the defenses
		in place... If we'd had the time to
		deploy a string of Patriot anti-
		missile batteries across the coast --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- You're saying we got all this
		lousy hardware and can't stop one
		goddamn missile??

Everyone's silence answers his question.



				PRESIDENT
			(continuing; thru video
			link)
		I want an immediate search for all
		ships within range.

				FBI CHIEF
		We better inform the other leaders,
		stall on the Summit --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		There's no reason to panic yet --
		they can't launch until after the
		family's confirmed dead!

				CIA CHIEF
		Afraid that's not the case...

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The North Korean Premier holds what
		we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
		able to destroy a missile in flight,
		right up to the moment before it
		achieves its target.

				CIA CHIEF
		Our Op says they've timed their
		retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

				FBI CHIEF
		And if the family turns up okay,
		they'll just make it self-destruct.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Shit! I really don't need this today!

				VICE PRESIDENT
		We're forgetting one thing here: the
		family. Intelligence is sure the
		North will abort their attack if Mrs.
		Han and her kids are safely returned?

				CIA CHIEF
		Absolutely. Their whole game depends
		on claiming a legitimate provocation.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Still, we should let them know there'd
		be a response... if it comes to it.



				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'd like to turn 'em into a
		radioactive parking lot.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		That's the problem: we can't. We're
		the last superpower. Our hands are
		tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
		stacks of treaties... most we could
		do is give 'em a "measured response"
		back again, or everyone starts
		crying that we're the bullies.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
		wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
		stunt like this.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Believe me, the North drops one in
		my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in
		theirs. Get some bombers in the air.
		And don't tell me any more bad news!

		Who's got those kinds of skills:
		Electronics, vehicle customizing,
		computers, explosives?

				DAVE
		Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your
		average high-school student if
		they're so inclined. My guess is our
		perp used off-the-shelf equipment
		for everything except the C-4, and

Accordingly, traffic is heavy and unpleasant.

				BOBBI (VO)
		Please, L.A., I know we're about to
		have quite a party out there, but
		don't forget the Golden Rule on the
		roadways... News time is 3:59...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity.

				BOBBI
		This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye
		in the Sky... back to you, Brent...

The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot.



				BOBBI
			(continuing; furious)
		Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that
		entire segment!
			(as if to a child)
		Keep... the sun... to my left!!

The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.

				BOBBI
			(continuing)
		What's new on the kidnapping rumor?

				CAMERAMAN
		Nada. Total news blackout.

				BOBBI
		Go back over the hill.

				NEWS PILOT
		We got the valley traffic report in
		fifteen --

				BOBBI
		-- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed!
		Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!

She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her
purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She
takes a huge swig and grimaces.

				BOBBI
			(continuing; to Cameraman)
		What are you lookin' at? I was the
		morning anchor in Houston! And I'm
		one break away from getting out of
		this stupid fuckin' whirlybird!

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy
carefully turns to her mother.

				JOY
		Why us?

				MRS. HAN
		You heard him -- for money.

				JOY
		What if something goes wrong?

				MRS. HAN
			(firmly)
		It won't.



INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair.

				CARSON
		I'm going to the kidnapping site.

				MIRANDA
		I want to talk to the witnesses.

Colonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him.

				CARSON
		Great, we'll hire a bus.

They leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand.

				DAVE
			(into phone)
		...I know it's privileged
		information, goddammit! Lemme talk
		to a supervisor... You are a
		supervisor... Lemme talk to your
		goddamn supervisor... I told you,
		I'm with the FBI...
			(to Sabatini)
		Cellular company says he was using a
		phone with a cloned number.

				SABATINI
		Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of
		the numbers called on the account.

				DAVE
		That's what I'm trying to get.
		They're saying I need a subpoena.
			(into phone)
		Don't put me on hold... Don't...
			(pulls phone from his ear)
		I'm listening to Michael fuckin'
		Bolton!

				SABATINI
		Walther! Get on the horn to Justice
		and deal with this!

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.

We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some
Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.



INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.

Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote-
control boxes. He picks up his radio.

				ROBBINS
			(into radio)
		A lot of the components are made by
		the same manufacturer -- a car
		security company.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Jump a copter to the Consulate. See
		if the manufacturer sells to the
		public. Find out what shops use their
		stuff; put people on the phones with
		a description of the perp.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

NEW ANGLE

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.

				YOUNG COP
		Inspector! Look at this...
			(reads from shell)
		"Dragon's Breath..?"



				CARSON
		Twelve-gauge shell filled with
		magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's
		worse than napalm -- Geneva
		Convention outlawed it for warfare.

				MIRANDA
		Then how did he get it?

				CARSON
		Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.
			(looks around)
		Where's the Consulate's car?

				YOUNG COP
			(beat)
		Uh... apparently it was stolen...

				COLONEL LEE
		Stolen!? What is it with you
		people --

				YOUNG COP
			(angry)
		-- What's this "you people" shit?

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Shut up!

				MIRANDA
			(aside; to Young Cop)
		He means all of us "you people."

				CARSON
			(to Young Cop)
		Find it! How many bulletproof
		Mercedes could be cruising around
		Crenshaw?

				YOUNG COP
		You'd be surprised...

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Ambassador Han, Walther and Sabatini are looking at a series
of high-definition faxes spread out on a table.

Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.

				CARSON
		Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was
		working alone, and he was a vicious
		son of a bitch. Old news.

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Ambassador Han)
		And our car was stolen.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I felt safer when I was the
		Ambassador to Libya.

				SABATINI
		Image enhancements came back.

POV OF PICTURES

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

				CARSON
		We going steady?



				SABATINI
		The sun position tells us the
		windows are facing northeast.
			(beat)
		Here's the best -- look at the glass
		on the prints hanging in the
		background. There's a reflection of
		a reflection, out on the street: the
		corner of a billboard.

				CARSON
		Looks like the wheel of a car.

				MIRANDA
		We talked about these billboards,
		when we were car shopping! Four-
		door... they make a wagon, too.
			(beat)
		Something Japanese... God, what was
		it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You
		thought it had no character.

				CARSON
		I thought that about all of them.
		C'mon, think, dammit!!

				MIRANDA
		You think!! You were there, too!

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

				CARSON
		Call the outdoor advertising
		companies. Get the location of all
		the billboards for Japanese cars
		within our search parameters.

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

				DAVE
			(into phone)
		...Peerless Auto Security. We need
		to know whether you've sold a large
		quantity of these components to any
		one customer, or whether you'd had
		any stolen recently...

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY

General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major
Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the
others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call
with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.

							CUT TO:

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device.

				OPERATIVE
			(urgently; into device)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped! It was switched by
		order of --

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"
button on the uplink device before dying.

On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then
another GUNSHOT destroys it.

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative
over with his foot.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is
trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.

				MRS. HAN
		He asked you if you had to go...

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

				JOY
		Oh, my God...

The meters are hovering just below the red...



SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,
still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the
tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
		using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.



				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
			(continuing)
		Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
		they attacked a Genoese fort, and
		catapulted infected corpses over the
		walls. The Genoese who survived
		carried the disease back to Europe...
		and it killed half the population.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Get to the goddamn point, Major.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

				CIA CHIEF
		Seems the missile is armed with a
		warhead carrying the Pneumonic
		Plague.

The President goes nuts.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
		to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
		What happened to this "limited
		retaliation" shit?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		The North Koreans insist the missile
		carries a conventional payload. They
		say we're trying to trick them into
		aborting the attack.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Especially since the uplink from our
		Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.

				CIA CHIEF
		We think one of the Hard-liners
		switched the warhead without the
		Premier's knowledge. But he's not
		about to take our word for it, and
		he's too weak to risk the
		humiliation of backing down.

				PRESIDENT
			(incredulous; thru video
			link)
		They use a biological weapon on
		American soil, they have to know
		we'll respond!



				SECRETARY OF STATE
		Maybe they don't think we got the
		guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
		they think they can whip us, like
		what happened in 'Nam. Look who
		we're dealing with: a teetering,
		outlaw regime, and inside it, some
		wild-ass renegades working their
		screwy agenda!

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		We've deployed Marines from Pendleton
		and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.
		Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,
		but it's 40 minutes before they're on
		the ground.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		All right. Assuming the worst...
		What'll happen?

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The warhead vents the plague
		bacteria above the target area,
		infecting about 50,000 people. First
		symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes
		become swollen; temperature rises to
		105. Victims turn deep purple from
		lung hemorrhaging, usually die the
		same day.
			(beat)
		There are treatments -- streptomycin
		and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
		overwhelmed by the numbers and its
		extreme contagiousness.

				CIA CHIEF
		We could have 500,000 infected in a
		week, who knows how many after that.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have
		the Summit leaders been warned?



				FBI CHIEF
		Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
		'til we give the all-clear.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		And you're sure it's safe if we can
		get 'em to destroy the missile in
		flight?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The bacteria can't survive the heat
		of an explosion.

				CIA CHIEF
		I suggest none of this go any
		further -- not even to the agents
		working to find the family. Word
		leaks out to a city of 12 million
		people there's rocket full of the
		Plague coming at 'em, you'll create
		a panic of biblical proportions.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is painfully on edge. Ambassador Han paces. The FBI
agents are on a phone or a radio, working leads.

Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.

				CARSON
		Say what?

				COLONEL LEE
		Perhaps someone will decide it is
		foolish to incur the wrath of North
		Korea.

				CARSON
			(crosses to Colonel Lee)
		Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole
		thing. And we're knocking our heads,
		trying to find your people, just for
		show.

				WALTHER
		Carson...

				CARSON
		Let's grab a few beers, kick back
		'til five o'clock rolls by. Then
		maybe we can have a war over it. I
		think that's a great idea, seeing as
		how you fuckers have needed your
		clocks cleaned for fifty years now!



				COLONEL LEE
			(gets up)
		Why wait until five?

Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from
going at each other.

				MIRANDA
		Pete!
			(sotto)
		Christ, you're self-indulgent!
		There's nothing but anger and
		cynicism left inside you, so they're
		all you can express any more. No
		wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks
		you're such a nutcase!

				CARSON
		Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep
		around the office... "Dr. Knoll-It-
		All."

				MIRANDA
			(hurt)
		You've been dying to tell me that...

She walks away. Carson immediately regrets saying it.

				CARSON
		Miranda...
			(to himself)
		Shit.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

LAPD cruisers squeeze through the crowded streets, fanning out

Robbins is still working the phone.

He puts the receiver down, hits the speakerbox button and the

We can hear the CONVERSATION at the alarm shop:

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)

		Tell Jerry, pick up line one!

INT.  AUTO SECURITY SHOP - DAY

A group of young INSTALLERS horse around as they outfit luxury

			(thru speakerbox)
		Man's Canadian, dickweeds!

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox)
		You're gonna have to call back on

Carson rushes over to the phone. To the others in the room:

				CARSON
		Everyone shut up!
			(into phone)
		Guy on vacation, the Canadian --

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox)
		-- Yeah, Javal...



				CARSON
			(into phone)
		Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes?

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox; laughs)
		Zombie Eyes! You know the man?

Carson and Miranda look at each other. Bingo!

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		I need a full name, address,
		anything you got!

				INSTALLER #1 (VO)
			(thru speakerbox)
		Paul Javal... hang on, we'll look it
		up... This an immigration thing?
		Shit, he's our best installer.

NEW ANGLE

One of the Korean Espionage Agents answers a RINGING phone on
Colonel Lee's desk, listens, then hits the hold button.

				ESPIONAGE AGENT
		Inspector Carson, extension 666...

				CARSON
		That's appropriate...
			(to Dave)
		In 30 seconds you're gonna give me
		Paul Javal's shoe size.

Carson hurries over, grabs the phone. We SEE him punch the
button for x666.

INT.  FBI SOUND LAB - DAY

EDWARDS, headphones around his neck, sits in front of a wall
of audio analysis equipment.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Whatta you got?



				EDWARDS
			(into phone)
		Ambient background sound is normal
		city stuff, but there's a distinct
		echo pattern. Your people are in or
		near a high-rise that's at least
		eight floors tall. And there are
		other high-rises nearby.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		How high up are they?

				EDWARDS
			(into phone)
		No way to extrapolate that from the
		sample you gave us.
			(refers to notes)
		One more thing: There's an emergency
		siren approaching at 17 seconds into
		the second call, passing the location
		at 33.5 seconds.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson hangs up the phone.

				CARSON
		Okay -- high-rises in our search
		area. Eight stories or higher.

				MIRANDA
		Downtown, Century City, Westwood
		corridor, Museum Row, Mid-
		Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip
		there's a few...

				CARSON
		Sabatini! What about that billboard?

				SABATINI
		Nothing yet! Everyone's left their
		goddamn offices already!

				CARSON
			(to Robbins)
		LAPD will have a record of all
		emergency vehicles running Code 3 at
		9:32 AM. Get their starting point
		and their destination.

				MIRANDA
		And have them narrow their foot-
		searches to areas around high-rises.



				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Where's that fuckin' address?!

				DAVE
		I'm still holdin'!

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM
connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the
keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair
longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		He's on our hit parade. Interpol
		passed us his records when he
		entered the country.
			(reads)
		French by birth... looks like a total
		scumbag.

				SABATINI
		Isn't that redundant?

				DAVE
			(reads from computer)
		Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;
		served some short stretches, petty
		shit... arrested for kidnapping, no
		conviction. Did four years in France
		for blowing bank vaults. Moved to
		U.S. last year. Clean since then.

				CARSON
		Get his Driver's License number;
		Social; bank accounts; charge cards;
		club memberships... find out what
		movies he rented.  Get whoever's
		closest to the Auto Shop to get in
		there, interview everybody.

				MIRANDA
		This sure was a ballsy move for a
		car-alarm installer.

				CARSON
		Hey, he watched the news... Everyone
		knows the U.S. will do anything to
		avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.

They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard.

				MIRANDA
		Ambassador --



				CARSON
		-- Quit apologizing for me!

				MIRANDA
		Quit giving me reasons to!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Carson)
		On occasion, my wife has been known
		to kick my ankle under the table.

Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.

				CARSON
		Sounds like her aim's a little low.

Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a
piece of paper.

				DAVE
		Address, according to the Auto Shop.

				CARSON
			(looks at paper)
		Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!
		Sabatini -- you're with us.
			(off Robbins' disappointed
			look)
		She's got the field experience.

Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.

				MIRANDA
		There still could be accomplices.
		If there are, they'll hear us in
		the helicopter.

Carson looks again at the address...

				CARSON
		There's a TV station a couple blocks
		away. We'll land on their pad.

		K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a
		SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to

SUPER: Osaka. Western Japan.

INT.  OSAKA APARTMENT - DAY

In the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair-bound JAPANESE TEENAGER,
computers and HAM RADIO equipment are stacked everywhere.

He turns on a tape recorder. We hear a faint, crackling VOICE:



				OPERATIVE'S VOICE (VO)
			(on recorder)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped!

The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

With the gardeners gone, and their sound sensors disabled,
Mrs. Han, Joy and Sam are SHOUTING for help.

They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.

EXT.  K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter
lands right next to it.

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on
the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,
videotaping everything.

				CARSON
		Oh, great, the media...
			(realizing)
		It's the goddamn traffic girl!

				MIRANDA
		Traffic person.

				BOBBI
		Where are you going?

				CARSON
		We can't get into that right now...

				BOBBI
		Hey, you expect to use my station's
		facilities and not even tell us --

Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and
crushes the tape.

				MIRANDA
			(to Bobbi)
		Sorry...



				BOBBI
			(looks Miranda over)
		What the fuck are you, the Barbie
		Corporate Ass-Lick model?

Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket
and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi
by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.

				MIRANDA
		Guess what, Sister... you're about
		to spend the next five years in a
		penitentiary for interfering with a
		federal investigation.

The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.

				STATION MANAGER
		Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their
		news blackout!

				BOBBI
			(to herself)
		Figures... you dickless wonder.

Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his
wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.

The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.

				STATION MANAGER
		I get an exclusive later, right?

				CARSON
		This works out, I'll play the
		fuckin' banjo for you.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food,

Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high

EXT.  U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa.

Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight
line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts.

They begin to TAKE OFF...



EXT.  FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY

The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.

Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped
vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners --
until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

				CARSON
		We're hoofing it.

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

				SABATINI
			(pissed)
		'She's got the field experience'...
		To park the fuckin' car!

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

				CARSON
			(pulls out his i.d.)
		Whoa... FBI..!

They lower their weapons.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		How the hell you get here so fast?



				SWAT TEAM #1
		They're shootin' a cop movie down
		the street. We're workin' as extras.

				CARSON
		Terrific. Who else is here?

				SWAT TEAM #1
		Three officers on the roof, next
		building over, and two in the tenth-
		floor hallway.

				CARSON
		Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
			(to Concierge)
		Give me your master key.

EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.

				SWAT TEAM #1
			(thru radio)
		Feds going up -- Anglo male and
		female; Asian male.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

				WOMAN
		What the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

				CARSON
			(to Miranda)
		Wait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
		while I look around.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

				MIRANDA
		I like what you've done with the
		place...



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

				COLONEL LEE
		Wait!

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

				SABATINI
		Where's Carson?

				COLONEL LEE
		Inside.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

				CARSON
		NO! --

Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

				CARSON
		I said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

				MIRANDA
		Stop it!

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Get out of my sight.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful
Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.

				BOBBI
			(into phone)
		Marchfelder.

				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(thru phone)
		You dated the Mayor, right?

				BOBBI
			(sighs; into phone)
		You need a traffic ticket fixed?



				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(excited; thru phone)
		Try to confirm something for us.
		There's an incredible buzz on the

		Intelligence frequency. We think
		it's authentic!

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,
as the festivities really start rockin'.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		What's the status?

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Wilshire and West PD Divisions had
		seven vehicles running with sirens at
		9:32. They're getting the routes from
		the officers now.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Hurry it the hell up.

He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		I should've known she'd come up.

				MIRANDA
		Pete --

				CARSON
		-- "Should've." Shit, there's a
		familiar word.
			(long beat)
		That day... I was there soon enough.
		We should've rushed 'em, before they
		could finish setting up...



				MIRANDA
		The Bureau never would've let you.
		They want it by the book: talk them
		out.

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
		Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.

				MIRANDA
		You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your
		decision. You can't keep living as
		such a raw nerve, never sleeping --

				CARSON
		-- Those kids were ten years old!
			(sotto)
		Same age as the Han boy...

He turns away. She takes his hand.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we

							CUT TO:



INT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,
construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.

A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:
     
		This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated
		For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

				CARSON
		C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
		records? What about cross-referencing
		possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

				MIRANDA
		Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
			(reaches for phone)
		Where are the numbers for the
		outdoor ad companies?

				ROBBINS
		Parker Center's making those calls.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:

				BOBBI
		Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!

				CAMERAMAN
		Maybe it's true... probably is true.
		That's why they got a news blackout!

				BOBBI
		I'll rip your miserable eyeballs
		out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!

He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...A warning was radioed to U.S.
		Intelligence that a biological weapon,
		allegedly containing the deadly
		Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los
		Angeles. While unconfirmed, the
		President and other leaders are all
		late in arriving...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.

				DAVE
		Finally got the call list from
		Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
		they're from the legit user who
		didn't know his number was cloned.

				CARSON
		Go to the bottom of the list, work
		back through the last 12 hours.

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

				DAVE
		Here's the call to the Consulate --
		965-5000.
			(while scrolling)
		The rest are dupes... all from the
		other guy...

				CARSON
		Wait... go back... the one at seven
		this morning...

Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.

WIDER

Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.

(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE

from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.

(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."



BACK TO SCENE

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

				CARSON
		Get down!

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		MIRANDA!

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

				MIRANDA
		Go..!

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and
severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a
drive in the country.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and
Ambassador Han gets in.

				CARSON
		Get the fuck out of here!

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson
sighs and tears out of the driveway.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then
hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,
zooming past the snarl of cars.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs
into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson looks around at the chaos around them.

				CARSON
		Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out
		here!

Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:



				FM NEWSCASTER (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...These words, which have terrified
		the city:

				RECORDING OF BOBBI (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...A biological weapon, allegedly

Stunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his
face in his hands.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Miranda..!

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I heard. I'm in the copter.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I want you to get out of here...

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is
beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Shut up and keep your eyes on the
		road. That's my goddamn car.
			(beat; into radio)
		Dave? You staying on top of the
		research?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while
hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He
grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		I can't... My kids...

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio; calmly)
		Listen: the best way to help them is
		to stay at your computer. If any
		information comes in, holler. Okay?

He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:



				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Okay...

EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Several large military helicopters approach -- troop
contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.

The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES
and ARMY INFANTRY.

Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to
follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the
helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.

We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,
Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of
pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the
heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --
in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he
HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY

Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps
off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

				BOBBI
		Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull
		back... show the other copters around
		us... this is fuckin' great...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.



				CARSON
		...The Colonel hired Javal, made it
		look like he was working alone. Then
		he made sure Javal got killed, so
		we'd never find your family -- and
		they'd have an excuse to drop their
		bomb. But what's in it for 'em?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There are men in my government whose
		power depends on North Korea staying
		as it is: Socialist, repressive,
		isolated from the world. They'll
		resort to anything, even war, to
		keep it that way. They have the
		Hitler Syndrome: if their country
		cannot exist the way they want it,
		they would rather see it destroyed.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto
the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.

				VREELAND (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We've got the situation in hand.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into
the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.



INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper
body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable
S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.

Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel
Lee, but there's no time...

				VREELAND
			(to Pilot)
		Shit! Pull back!

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a
rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the
Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two
tons of red-hot shrapnel.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.

		Jesus fuckin' God!!!
			(beat; smiles)
		Uh, I think we're gonna set down
		now. Back to you, Brent.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-
mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.

Hot metal and debris PINGS and POPS as it rains over the
neighborhood, sending cars and pedestrians rushing for cover.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - DAY

Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.

				VREELAND
			(into radio)
		Out of the air, or retreat 7,000

The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.
Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming
them in an attempt to leave the city.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks
back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.

				JOY
		I always hated that guy...

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the
biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee
squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson
looks at Ambassador Han:

				CARSON
		One of yours?
			(Han nods)
		What the hell do you need heat-
		seeking rockets for in L.A.?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There could be another riot...

				CARSON
			(shakes his head)
		And they call me Mr. Overkill.
			(into radio)
		Dave, what do you know about...

He looks at Han.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Strela-2...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda has hitched a ride in a black-and-white.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Stay back. LAPD's putting up a
		roadblock.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP
BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.

They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then
stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their
huge front shovels to create a roadblock.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY

Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...

WIDER

The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.

Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a
KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...

Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY
stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the
copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:

				BOBBI
		Save it for someone who gives a
		shit!



EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.
So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.

MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and
hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking
lots.

PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and
windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,
angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.

The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.
Carson catches up to it.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to
		arm, so stay tight on his ass.

Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han
braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.



				CARSON
		That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses
		you'd like to tell me about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I don't think so -- they said it was
		solid as a rock.

				CARSON
			(looks at his crumpled car)
		No shit...

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(dazed)
		I can't believe I'm still alive...

				CARSON
		This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

				CARSON
		Get me out of here...

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Anybody see him?

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Still heading north on the 110.

The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador
Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

				CARSON

		Dave... You're sure those rockets
		are heat-seeking?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Classic IR, reflective optical

Carson climbs into the back of the ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE - DAY

Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking
for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		This is Carson. I need a copter.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY

Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard,
Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy.

				CARSON (VO)

		Something small and nimble.
		Anybody... come in low, from the

		Are you out of your mind?

INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the
minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her
Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs
the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:



				BOBBI
		Get this fuckin' thing in the air!
			(to Cameraman)
		Out! Not enough room for four.

				CAMERAMAN
			(as they TAKE OFF)
		What am I supposed to do when the
		plague comes, hold my breath?

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

They rapidly cut through the traffic.

		Switch to a secure channel.

		What on earth are you thinking?

				CARSON (VO)

		I'll make him open the sunroof.

		Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		No way. I couldn't stand making so
		many people happy.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.

				CARSON
		You?! I wanted a police copter!

				PILOT
		Just tell me what to do. I flew two
		tours in 'Nam.



				BOBBI
		And he doesn't go unless I go!

				CARSON
		Wrong-o...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!

WIDER

They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.
Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

BOBBI

surfaces, sputtering and screaming:

				BOBBI
		I'm a respected electronic
		journalist, you fuckin' prick!!

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of
Mylanta out after her.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

In the distance, there is smog on the horizon.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes
cutting across lanes.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Got 'im -- looks like he's headed
		for the 101.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.



				CARSON
			(to Pilot)
		Pull hard to the left, on my
		signal...

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

				CARSON
		Now!

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda sees what Carson is doing.

				MIRANDA
		You fucking lunatic!!

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The News Pilot looks over at Carson.

				PILOT
		Hope you got more flares than he's
		got rockets.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...



EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

VARIOUS ANGLES

As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.



				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

				MIRANDA
		You're completely deranged! Playing
		chicken with rockets!

				CARSON
		Well, what the hell were you doing
		out there?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		What are both of you doing?

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

				CARSON
		Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.

				MIRANDA
		Even if we can pry him out with...
			(looks at her watch)
		Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
		be very cooperative.

				CARSON
		I'll just use my outstanding people
		skills.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Ambassador
			Han)
		That car's like a rock, right?

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.



INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY

Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

CLOSER

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.



				MIRANDA
		Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
		Well, these are fuck you pumps!
			(pushes harder)
		Where's the family?

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on
his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.

				DAVE
		Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned
		into Dirty Harriet!

He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.

				DAVE
			(continuing; into phone)
		You're sure there were no accounts in
		the other names I gave you?

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Let him up.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

				COLONEL LEE
		Victory!

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

WIDER

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.



EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

Ahead, in the distance, the coastline comes into view.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family stares at the TV. Mrs. Han purses her lips...
fighting it... a tear rolls down her face. The time: 4:51.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson reaches for his two-way radio.

				CARSON

We PULL BACK... they're way up in a high-rise building... The
CAMERA continues to PULL BACK, farther and farther...

The hostages can hear the WHOOPING fire alarms and the (OS)
ANNOUNCEMENT. Joy looks at Mrs. Han, hopeful.

				JOY
		They must know we're here...

				ALL
		Help!

No answer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on
the complex from all directions.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

				VOICE THRU PA
		Han family. Show us your location...

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

				JOY
		Mother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

				MRS. HAN
		Do it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.

				MILTON
		It's a brown binder... Says "Rental
		Manifest." You can't miss it...

They literally tear the office apart.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Apartment number would be real
		helpful, gang...

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

				MIRANDA
		There!

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The coast looms closer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

				CARSON
		Okay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

				LISA
		Hurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

				CARSON
		DON'T!

He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		We have to go out the window.

				MRS. HAN
		Can't you disarm the bomb?



				CARSON
		Too risky. Let's concentrate on
		getting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Sound detectors?

				MRS. HAN
		Sam covered them with chewing gum.

				SAM
		High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

				CARSON
		Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
		convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
		seat, he sets the alarm off. These
		are rigged backwards -- get up, you
		set 'em off.

				SAM
		You a bomb expert?

				CARSON
		Nope. But I've had some car alarms
		in my day.
			(to himself)
		For all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
		Slide your arm forward... Watch the
		meter... Keep the pressure on the
		armrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
		the weight of your arm... Okay...
		pick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



				CARSON
			(continuing; to Sam)
		Low-tech solution...
			(to Mrs. Han)
		Lean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio in his pocket)
		How's it going in there?

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Nag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making
an incredible racket.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

WIDER

The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

				CARSON
		You'll be over in five seconds...

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.

ANGLE ON BOMB

One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

CARSON

sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.
Han into it...

				CARSON
		Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

ANGLE ON BOMB

Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

THE HARNESS

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

				CARSON
			(shouts)
		Release the cable from your side!
		Get out of here!

		Come over the railing! Grab onto the

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.

All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.

Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

BACK TO SCENE

The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

NEW ANGLE

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

				SAM
		I can't stand it -- half an hour to
		get to the stupid school every
		morning... with no music...
			(Korean; subtitled)
		[Just our damn Nanny...]

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS

Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

WIDER

Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

				DRIVER
			(Korean)
		[Stay in the car.]



EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

ANGLE WITH JAVAL

as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

							FADE TO:



EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY

Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

							CUT TO:

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

				CARSON
		Son of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

				MIRANDA
		Pete... please... we have to be up
		early tomorrow. Call the police.



				CARSON
		Yeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Shit!

MIRANDA

pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

				MIRANDA
		Not again...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

NEW ANGLE

Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

				WESTEC GUARD
		Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
		the ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

				CARSON
		Asshole was trying to boost my car!

ANGLE ACROSS STREET

Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

				CARSON
		Mike -- call 911!

				NEIGHBOR
		Been trying...
			(has a cordless phone)
		It's busy.
			(to Guards; re Carson)
		He's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

CLOSER

Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

				JOY
		There are six bathrooms in this
		house, Sam.

				SAM
			(fanning the air)
		But only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(Korean)
		[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing)
		[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

				MRS. HAN
		It's the Governess...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Hilda...

CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS

as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

				GOVERNESS
			(thru phone)
		Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We will see you next week...
			(hangs up; smiles to kids)
		It appears I'll be taking you to
		school.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

				JAVAL
		Very good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY

Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

ANGLE ON TV

A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
		gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
		July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
		rolled into one! All over town
		there'll be parades, concerts,
		rallies, festivals... So get out
		there everyone, but plan your drive-
		time accordingly! This is Bobbi
		Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

				MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
			(on TV)
		The President is on his way...

				PRESIDENT
			(on TV)
		...It's an honor hosting my fellow
		leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
		city of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

				MORNING ANCHOR
			(on TV)
		We'll see the menu for Mayor
		Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
		after this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

BACK TO SCENE

As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

				MIRANDA
		I was watching that.

				CARSON
		If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
		I'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

				CARSON
			(continuing; while smiling)
		I said, if we were having sex once in
		a while, you wouldn't need to ride
		that fucking bike every morning.



				MIRANDA
			(hasn't heard a thing)
		Be right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY

Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

				MIRANDA
			(looks him over)
		Have you gotten any sleep lately?

				CARSON
			(ignores the question)
		Shop's gonna tow the car in --
		goddamn ignition's trashed.

				MIRANDA
		Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

				CARSON
		You ask me, those suckers are a lost
		cause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

				MIRANDA
		It's not for you.

				CARSON
		You mean it's not for you.

				MIRANDA
		I don't chase car thieves in my
		underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
		boredom if we ever sold this house
		and moved.



				CARSON
		I'd die of shock, from finding
		anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
		Even for what it's worth now.

				MIRANDA
		Lots of people bought at the top of
		the market...

				CARSON
		That sure cheers me right up.

				MIRANDA
		I don't know why we even talk about
		it. The city's not the problem. So
		we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
		that saying: "Wherever you go, there
		you are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		I hope you're current on your
		tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

				CARSON
		One cut... two assholes in the
		hospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Well, another day of baby-sitting my
		favorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

				MIRANDA
		Ask for a transfer.

				CARSON
		They're not gonna transfer me. You
		know damn well why I was bumped down
		to guard duty...
			(as he's leaving)
		My outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY

A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
SWEARING:

				ANGRY VOICE (OS)
		Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
		shit...

THEIR POV

In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

JOY

turns to Mrs. Han:

				JOY
		Can we give Lisa a ride?

INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY

It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

				LISA
		Hey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



				LISA
			(continuing)
		Excellent -- I can't hear him!

				SAM
			(raps on window)
		The glass is an inch thick.
			(points to doors, roof)
		Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
		proof.

				LISA
		Perfect car for L.A.
			(looks back at her Dad)
		Starts, too.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.



				ROBBINS
		Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
		escaped the office!

				DAVE
		I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
		a chance to hose out my cage.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

				ROBBINS
		Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

				SABATINI
		"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
		call him.
			(yawns; flops in a chair)
		Friggin' graveyard shift...

				ROBBINS
		Love to know what dope made it the
		Bureau's job to give full-time
		protection to foreign consulates.
			(offers coffee to Dave)
		Cup a mud?

				DAVE
		Not if you made it. Why don't you
		get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
		the alleged chick.

				SABATINI
		Blow me.

				DAVE
		Where's Carson?

				SABATINI
		On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
		off his Mustang last night.
			(beat; solemnly)
		They cut the ragtop.

				DAVE
		Motherfuckers...

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.



				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Latest and greatest. Wireless
		network link-ups.

				SABATINI
		Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

				ROBBINS
		Me, too.

				DAVE
		Ingrates.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY

The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



INSERT

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

WIDER

The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



				JAVAL
		You see that I'm serious in my
		intention, yes?
			(she nods)
		If you cooperate, you and your
		children will be home for dinner
		tonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

				COLONEL LEE
			(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
		[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Someone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



				SABATINI
		You got no jurisdiction outside
		this property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

				SABATINI
			(continuing)
		Shit!
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Yank his fuckin' leash!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		My men are going!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing; to Sabatini)
		It's a white telephone van, driving
		west on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

				ROBBINS
		Keys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

				SABATINI
		You're ridin' shotgun.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

				ROBBINS
		Cherry?

				DAVE
		Under the seat.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

				ROBBINS
		Siren?

				DAVE
		I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
		hurry..!



EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

				SABATINI
		Someone snatched Han's family! White
		phone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

				CARSON
		Give me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

				CO-WORKER
		Someone's been to Nordstroms, big
		time.

				WALTHER
		Clothes make the man.

				CO-WORKER
		But does the man make enough for the
		clothes?

				WALTHER
			(smiles)
		The man makes payments on his Visa.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.



				SECRETARY
		Mr. Walther... priority line!

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
		Walther... What's the nature of your
		emer --
			(grimaces)
		Aw, Jesus... not today...
			(beat)
		I'll inform channels and get a copter
		in the air. For God's sake, keep it
		quiet. Do what you can, but don't
		endanger civilians or the family!

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		You bet -- nice and easy.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Get the Secretary of State on the
		horn.
			(listens)
		I know he left already. I'm familiar
		with the concept of time zones. Find
		his ass.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on
		its way.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.



INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Think it's them?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll
		move up; he won't suspect a civilian
		car. Stay back, then get on his ass
		when I signal. We'll box him in.

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		If the Mod Squad gets in your way,
		don't be shy about getting 'em out.

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Copy that one.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

				SABATINI
		Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

HIS POV

As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



JAVAL

grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

				JAVAL
		I need to concentrate!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

NEW ANGLE

The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY

Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's gonna wrap it around something!

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



NEW ANGLE

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

				COLONEL LEE
		You should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

				CARSON
		I'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

				ROBBINS
		Forget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY

A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing
that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.



				CARSON
		Let's get back to the Consulate.

Off their perplexed looks, we

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

				JAVAL
		Does anyone need to use the rest
		room? This will be your last
		opportunity for a few hours.
			(no takers)
		Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,
		please sit here.
			(indicates the Lazy Boys;
			then turns to Lisa)
		And you... what is your name?

				LISA
			(after a beat)
		Lisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

				JAVAL
		No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

				JAVAL
			(continuing; sotto)
		You afford me some additional
		bargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		There. No taping your mouths, no
		restraints. Please remain still
		while I explain. The meters on the
		left indicate sound pressure --
		Decibels. There are microphones on
		your chair backs. If you raise your
		voices above certain level, putting
		your meter in the red zone for more
		than one sustained second, the
		circuit will be closed.
			(beat)
		The right meters indicate motion.
		There are pressure sensors inside the
		armrests and seats. The sensors don't
		like to get wet, so I hope you were
		honest about not needing to use the
		loo. If you make any excess
		movements, or try to leave your
		chair, the circuit will be closed.

				MRS. HAN
		I don't understand...

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

				MRS. HAN
			(continuing; softly)
		What happens if the circuit closes?

				JAVAL
		Kaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Easy... deep breath...
			(to the kids)
		Do each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(on TV)
		...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
		whole city had an such an opportunity --

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

				WALTHER
		Carson?
			(Carson nods)
		Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

				CARSON
		His Security Chief.
			(beat)
		There was a civilian with them --
		fifteen-year-old girl from across
		the street. We're trying to reach
		the parents.

				WALTHER
		Goddamn it...
			(sotto)
		Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
		Premier's niece! We're hearing
		rumors they're gonna make a major
		issue out of what happened here...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

				CARSON
		I'm not so sure what happened here.
		Something smells. Asshole was acting
		like he wanted us to spot him...



				WALTHER
		What the hell are you talking about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		Mr. Walther?

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.

				WALTHER
		Ambassador Han... my deepest --

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		-- I have no wish for condolences.
		Just answers.

				WALTHER
		As soon as we have any to give...

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		Yoon..?!

				CARSON
			(to FBI agents)
		Start a trace!

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Carson; incensed)
		You are tapping our phones?!

				CARSON
			(while crossing to
			Ambassador Han)
		Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
		Streep.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.



				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We are not hurt. But this man is
		very serious --

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

				JAVAL
			(into phone)
		I want you to remember the feeling
		you had when you thought your family
		was dead, and use it to inform the
		choices you're about to make.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

				CARSON
		Say you want to talk to the kids...

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		I need to know my children are all
		right.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Be in front of a television in two
		minutes. Tune it to channel four.
		You'll get the picture.

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There is a television in my office.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're screwed on the trace -- he's
		on a cell phone.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

				DAVE
		Play the tape back. I might be able
		to pull the electronic serial number
		out of the subcarrier.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Ask Dave if he knows how to find the
		phone's serial number.

				ROBBINS
			(smiles; into radio)
		Hey, great idea...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

ANGLE ON TV

It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

CLOSER

There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
			(beat)
		Look at the TV -- this was just
		taken.

BACK TO SCENE

A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.



				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		There must surely be several people
		in the room; you may put me on the
		speakerbox if you wish.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(continuing; thru
			speakerbox)
		I am not a terrorist. Your
		countries' political posturing means
		nothing to me. So do not waste time
		trying to negotiate.
			(beat)
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
		Angeles can furnish ten million
		dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
		required denominations are in the
		instructions, as is the method of
		packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
		PM, and drive north on Highland
		Avenue. I will call with where to
		leave the money, which you will do
		at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
		call again at 4:00 with the family's
		location and the method for removing
		them from their... predicament.
		Could you please refer to page one?
			(they look at the photo)
		Any deviation from these instructions
		and my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Walther)
		P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

				WALTHER
		Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
		Negotiator is on the way --

				CARSON
		-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
		thing we need! This asshole sound
		like he was interested in bargaining?

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:


				WALTHER
		We have people who are experts in
		these situations. We really feel it
		would be best if you let them
		coordinate everything...

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

				WALTHER
			(continuing; to Carson)
		Let's get on it...

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

				CARSON
		...You're gonna just pay up, count
		on his good nature to return the
		family?!

				WALTHER
		It's the President's intention to
		keep this quiet, move forward with
		the Summit, and work with the North
		Koreans. Jesus, you've already
		embarrassed the shit out of us over
		the phone surveillance --

				CARSON
		-- They know their phones are tapped!
		They tap our fucking phones!

				WALTHER
		That's not the point! The point is
		not acknowledging it!
			(beat)
		We got an international incident
		brewing, with a country we were
		practically at war with last year!
		Our best Negotiator is gonna run
		point. If you got a problem, you can
		take the goddamn rest of the day off.

				CARSON
		This Consulate is my responsibility.

				WALTHER
		Not any more.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.



				WALTHER
			(continuing)
		That's the Negotiator. You do the
		briefing.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

				CARSON
		...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
		There are events gearing up all
		around town, and a dozen world
		leaders arriving. Add the Friday
		rush hour and usual L.A. bad
		behavior and it'll be a nightmare
		out there by 3 PM. It all works to
		the advantage of the kidnapper,
		hinders our pursuit efforts...
			(frowns)
		You don't agree?

WIDER


The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.


It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.

				MIRANDA
		I'm wondering whether to believe him
		when he says he's strictly motivated
		by money.

				CARSON
			(grabs faxes back)
		You see one word of Peoples'-
		Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
		whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
		this-week bullshit in this entire
		letter?

				MIRANDA
		I still want to check the MO against
		known politicals, terrorists --



				CARSON
		-- Already doing it. We're
		coordinating with the Secret
		Service, the NSA and the CIA.

				MIRANDA
		Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
		them a cover story for the media
		about the crash on La Cienega.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

				WALTHER
		Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
		is your wife?!

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

				CARSON
			(while looking at Miranda)
		If she'd changed her name when we
		got married, I wouldn't have to.

				MIRANDA
			(to Carson)
		I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
		finally work together...

				WALTHER
		Jesus, forget I asked.
			(beat)
		The cash will be here in an hour.
			(to Miranda)
		Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
		thoughts?

				MIRANDA
		Everything indicates he's working
		alone. And his concerns do seem to
		be solely about the money... so I
		agree that he's only using the
		Summit and the tension with North
		Korea to create extreme motivation
		to pay the ransom.

				COLONEL LEE
		I will bring the money to him.

				CARSON
		My ass.

				COLONEL LEE
		The hostages are citizens of the
		People's Republic of Korea --

				CARSON
		-- Hey, do I go to the torture
		chambers in your prisons, tell you
		how to do your job?

				WALTHER
		All right, you're outta here! Is
		this the same insubordinate crap you
		pulled at Beverly Thrift?

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

				CARSON
		I'll coordinate the drop.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Perhaps that is better. Inspector
		Carson knows the terrain --

				COLONEL LEE
		-- Then he can come with me.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

				WALTHER
			(firm; to Carson)
		It's settled.

				CARSON
		It sucks.

				MIRANDA
		But it means we can get on with it.

The Americans leave the room.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

				MIRANDA
			(sotto)
		Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
		If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
		Beverly Thrift never would've
		happened.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

				JAVAL
		That's more like it...

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

				OPERATIVE
			(into uplink device)
		...They've got the Premier agreeing
		to the hard-line position --

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

				OPERATIVE
			(continuing; sotto)
		More to follow...

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

				DAVE
		I wanted to be home by now, take the
		kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

				SABATINI
		We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
		L.A. was supposed to be a brown
		blotch in the rear-view mirror.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

				MIRANDA
		He'll expect a homing device --

				CARSON
		-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
		check the cash with an RF detector...
			(re larger transmitter)
		Meaning he'll find this one.
			(re smaller transmitter)
		This only has a quarter-mile range,
		but on a frequency too low to detect.
			(turns off receiver)
		And I doubt the asshole will have an
		X-ray machine or a metal detector.

				MIRANDA
		Why must you always refer generically
		to criminals as "assholes?"

				CARSON
		Gosh, you're right. It could
		undermine their self-esteem and spoil
		their chances for rehabilitation.

	
				MIRANDA
		You been reading my magazines in the
		bathroom again?

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru recorder)
		"And my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

				MIRANDA
		He's really exhibiting pressured
		speech... big effort here to sound
		calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
		he were in control, he wouldn't feel
		such a need to sound that way.

				CARSON
		Just tell me if we can use it.

				MIRANDA
		If we needle him he could get sloppy
		and give us an opening, but I'm not
		going to risk it. This is the worst
		kind of perpetrator: anything makes
		him deviate from his carefully-
		scripted plan, he could become
		extremely volatile.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Do we have back-up if the bleeper
		fails?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Nothing but physical surveillance.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

				MIRANDA
		It's real important we don't lose
		him. He didn't go through all the
		trouble of designing that bomb not
		to use it.

Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.



				CARSON
		Well, it ain't gonna happen.
			(beat; sotto)
		Not again...

EXT.  WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF
DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit
nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.
The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell is the big crisis?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		We just received a missive from the
		North Korean attachÈ. They say the
		kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
		and humiliate them during the Summit.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Bullshit. They're just ticked because
		we don't want the Chinese dragging
		their asses into the treaty talks.

The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		We have a covert operative in place.
		He reports the hard-liners and
		moderates in the High Command are
		arguing about how to respond, should
		the Premier's niece and her children
		should be killed.

				PRESIDENT
			(scowls; thru video link)
		Respond?! Christ. What about the
		damn Premier?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		He's weak. He has to look tough to
		save face, keep control of hard-
		liners... otherwise he risks a coup.

				CIA CHIEF
		Which is a real possibility. Most of
		those old-fart Generals don't want to
				-more-

				CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)
		be part of the Summit any more than
		we want them to. They're mad as hell
		he even talked to the Chinese.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't want to deal with this right
		now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell
		the North we'll pay the ransom for
		'em... Placate 'em! And make damn
		sure we get that family back in one
		piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?

				FBI CHIEF
		The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack
		team in place.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		There's a Diplomatic Liaison from
		State, too.

				CIA CHIEF
			(to FBI Chief)
		What about your man stationed at the
		Consulate...
			(refers to notes)
		Carson? He was demoted from the FBI
		Hostage Program, couple years back.
		And this did happen on his watch...

				FBI CHIEF
			(irritated)
		There's no way he could've prevented
		this abduction! Besides, I've got one
		of my top Negotiators in charge --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- Whatever. I want a total news
		blackout and I want this over with,
		quickly! Without giving those Commie
		little bastards any excuse to shit
		all over my Summit!

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the
driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is
already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is
completely in the car.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town
is all done up with posters and banners.

Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an
unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag
Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the
two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		Yes, please go ahead...

				JAVAL (VO)
			(long beat; thru phone)
		Ah... this must be one of those
		professionals --

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		-- I'm only here to see that
		everyone gets what they want --

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		-- I've got my shotgun in little
		Lisa's mouth, and I will pull the
		trigger in five seconds unless you
		put the Ambassador on the phone.

Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

From the two-way radio in Carson's pocket:

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		The drop is at the DeMille barn,
		across from the Hollywood Bowl.
		You're to leave the money in the
		center of the parking lot.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Shit... no way we can set up a stake-
		out in...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(checks watch)
		Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers
		at the Bowl. Have them clear the
		area of civilians.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Remember, Pete... we're dealing with
		a customer with a lot of rage.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Must've bought a house same time we
		did.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland
near Hollywood Blvd.

Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising
around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.

A BIKER CLUB

of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn
from the Boulevard onto Highland.

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood
Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a
sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.

Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money
from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the
pavement. Carson looks around.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		There's about a hundred ways he can
		scurry off like a cockroach from
		here... So spread out.

Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs
a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,
smacks his arm and points ahead:

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above
the bags of money.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream
		truck!

EXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY

Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector
wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them
makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY

The van pulls away.

Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.
He looks up...

Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.

				DAVE
		Son of a bitch!
			(into radio)
		He found the bleepers -- both of
		them!

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like
		he'll be hard to see in that truck.
		Which way's he heading?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Toward the freeway.

Carson hangs a U-turn.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,
Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		What happened?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're made! Gotta grab him!

				MIRANDA
			(beat; into radio)
		All right... Carefully...

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.

				CARSON
		Watch it! We need him alive!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.

				COLONEL LEE
		Turn around!

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

				CARSON
		FBI. Call our office, they'll take
		care of you.

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

				BIKER
		I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
		dentist!

COLONEL LEE

gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

WIDER

When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

				CARSON
		Just don't kill yourself, you piece
		of shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Helicopter or two would be nice!

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Love to be in the loop on this...

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Not just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

				CARSON
			(continuing; grumbling)
		I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
		horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

JAVAL

speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's on foot, at the base of the
		elevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

CLOSER

From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

BEHIND CARSON

the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

NEW ANGLE

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

				CARSON
		Fingerprint it.
			(to Walther)
		He's not gonna tell us where to find
		the hostages...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(looks at watch)
		Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
		figure it out for ourselves.

				WALTHER
		Figure it out?! With what?!

				CARSON
			(ignores him; into radio)
		Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
			(to Robbins)
		Get back to his van. There were no
		plates, but check the VIN, look it
		over, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Go!

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		...Scrounge us some bodies: National
		Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
		PD's, meter maids --

				WALTHER
		-- They're gonna search the whole
		city in a goddamn hour..?!

				CARSON
		Look, I don't need you to tell me
		how fucked we are!

				WALTHER
		Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
		case something explodes!

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

				MIRANDA
		Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
		is a luxury we can't afford!
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
			(looks at Carson)
		What's done is done. There'll be
		plenty of time to point fingers
		later.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

				SABATINI
		I need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		This is impossible! How can you even
		begin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

				MIRANDA
		Well, the normal procedure is to
		negotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

				CARSON
		Let's take stock. We've got a picture
		of where he hid the family, and
		recordings of his calls --

				MIRANDA
		-- That's right! We can send them to
		our experts for analysis...

				CARSON
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Same with his fingerprints. But that
		means we need high-quality image and
		data transmission. We can piss away
		ten minutes coptering this shit to
		our offices in Westwood, or we can
		use your surveillance equipment.

				COLONEL LEE
		There is no surveillance equipment.
		This is a diplomatic facility --

				CARSON
		-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Take them upstairs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

				CARSON
		South Korean Consulate's just down
		the street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

				CARSON
			(continuing; re hand)
		Shitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
		Got a digital scanner?

				COLONEL LEE
		Analog.

				CARSON
			(looks equipment over)
		You might want to drop a few bucks at
		Radio Shack and get with the decade.
			(into radio)
		Dave -- get in here. Bring your
		computer, a city map, and the tapes
		of the ransom calls.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		On my way...

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



				MIRANDA
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
		him to the Ambassador, see if it's
		anyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
		of prints coming over. Narrow the
		search criteria: Male, thirties,
		Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
		maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and
		bombers first. We need an answer in
		fifteen minutes.

EXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

FBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g.

INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY

A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high-
resolution computer monitor.

		That yellow air out there finally
		rot your brain?! It's impossible!

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Dazzle me.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		We got one of the best sound guys
		right here in town...
			(into phone)
		Newman in Audio Analysis...

				DAVE (OS)
		Newman's gone.

WIDER

Dave comes into the room.



				DAVE
		He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
		bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

				DAVE
			(continuing; looks around)
		Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
		to see the fight tonight.

				CARSON
		Get those tapes transferred to a
		sound guy. We need ambient and
		background analysis, the whole
		enchilada.

				DAVE
		Enchilada -- you saying that because
		I'm Mexican?

				CARSON
		No... 'cause you're fat.

				MIRANDA
			(picks up Javal's fax)
		Photo enhancement... Isn't there
		some amazing tech with the LAPD --

				DAVE
		-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
		PD a month ago.

				CARSON
		Jesus H. Christ...

				SABATINI
		I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
		earn their keep.

				CARSON
		Do it.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.

				MIRANDA
		Given his behavior, this orange
		residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
		Amphetamines.

				CARSON
		Any significance?



				MIRANDA
		It's consistent with the lone wolf
		scenario: A handful of these is pure
		bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
		psychosis and paranoia kick in.
			(beat)
		We could check pharmacy records, on
		the remote chance he got them
		legally... if we had a couple of
		weeks, that is.

				CARSON
			(to Sabatini)
		Get the Bureau on it.

				MIRANDA
		Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

				CARSON
		Look, goddammit, you start skipping
		no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
		quit and go to the beach right now.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
		last certain visual we had was just
		before his van went into the alley
		on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
		Consulate at 9:30.

				MIRANDA
		That gives him about fifty minutes
		to get to his location, move and
		secure the hostages, and activate
		his time bomb.

				CARSON
		He probably waited a while to pad
		the time -- he wanted us know the
		family was still alive...
			(sotto; re Koreans)
		...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
		throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
		but he didn't want to call too soon,
		either. I say they're within 15 to
		20 minutes, via surface streets, of
		where we last saw them.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.



				MIRANDA
		The most densely-populated part of
		the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
		to about 200,000 dwellings.

A beat while this sinks in.

		He was traveling west --

				CARSON
		-- Bet he doubled back.

				MIRANDA
		C'mon, that's total conjecture --

				SABATINI

				MIRANDA
		You're telling me?

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
		accusing us of botching the ransom
		drop on purpose.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They're still harping on that
		"American plot" nonsense.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Meaning?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They say the death of the Premier's
		niece and her family would justify
		immediate retaliation.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
		What kind of retaliation?

Everyone in the room looks at one another.



				CIA CHIEF
		They're threatening to pull a Saddam
		Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
		at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
			(beat)
		They're talking about firing a
		missile into Los Angeles --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- A goddamn WHAT??

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
		cruise -- their version of our
		Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
		find the city, but it's not too
		accurate beyond that.

				VICE PRESIDENT
		Still, for their purposes it's
		perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
		out a city block or two...

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		To the eyes of the world it's a
		measured response -- like what Reagan
		did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
		at an American city would be a huge
		psychological victory for them.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't believe I'm hearing this!
			(beat)
		So if we know it's coming, we can
		knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		These weapons fly subsonically, below
		radar... we don't have the defenses
		in place... If we'd had the time to
		deploy a string of Patriot anti-
		missile batteries across the coast --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- You're saying we got all this
		lousy hardware and can't stop one
		goddamn missile??

Everyone's silence answers his question.



				PRESIDENT
			(continuing; thru video
			link)
		I want an immediate search for all
		ships within range.

				FBI CHIEF
		We better inform the other leaders,
		stall on the Summit --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		There's no reason to panic yet --
		they can't launch until after the
		family's confirmed dead!

				CIA CHIEF
		Afraid that's not the case...

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The North Korean Premier holds what
		we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
		able to destroy a missile in flight,
		right up to the moment before it
		achieves its target.

				CIA CHIEF
		Our Op says they've timed their
		retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

				FBI CHIEF
		And if the family turns up okay,
		they'll just make it self-destruct.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Shit! I really don't need this today!

				VICE PRESIDENT
		We're forgetting one thing here: the
		family. Intelligence is sure the
		North will abort their attack if Mrs.
		Han and her kids are safely returned?

				CIA CHIEF
		Absolutely. Their whole game depends
		on claiming a legitimate provocation.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Still, we should let them know there'd
		be a response... if it comes to it.



				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'd like to turn 'em into a
		radioactive parking lot.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		That's the problem: we can't. We're
		the last superpower. Our hands are
		tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
		stacks of treaties... most we could
		do is give 'em a "measured response"
		back again, or everyone starts
		crying that we're the bullies.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
		wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
		stunt like this.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Believe me, the North drops one in
		my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in
		theirs. Get some bombers in the air.
		And don't tell me any more bad news!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins stands by Javal's van, on the shoulder of the freeway.

				ROBBINS

		...Phone company decal's a fake. DMV

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Cute.
			(to Miranda)
		He signed the name of the Allied
		Commander during the Korean War.
		Maybe he was a political.

				MIRANDA
		No. The phony ice cream truck, the
		booby-trapped chairs... he could've
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
		done it without half that stuff. But
		this was going to be the score of a
		lifetime... he was showing off.

				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Who's got those kinds of skills:
		Electronics, vehicle customizing,
		computers, explosives?

				DAVE
		Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your
		average high-school student if
		they're so inclined. My guess is our
		perp used off-the-shelf equipment
		for everything except the C-4, and
		that's only slightly harder to get
		than crack or heroin, if you know
		who to ask.

EXT.  PARKER CENTER - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

LAPD headquarters.

Everyone who can be spared, even moth-eaten SUPPORT PERSONNEL,
hustle through the maze of hallways and get into waiting cars.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

From up here, it looks like the city is one big block party.
Accordingly, traffic is heavy and unpleasant.

				BOBBI (VO)
		Please, L.A., I know we're about to

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity.

				BOBBI
		This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye

The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot.



				BOBBI
			(continuing; furious)
		Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that
		entire segment!
			(as if to a child)
		Keep... the sun... to my left!!

The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.

				BOBBI
			(continuing)
		What's new on the kidnapping rumor?

				CAMERAMAN
		Nada. Total news blackout.

				BOBBI
		Go back over the hill.

				NEWS PILOT
		We got the valley traffic report in
		fifteen --

				BOBBI
		-- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed!
		Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!

She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her
purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She
takes a huge swig and grimaces.

				BOBBI
			(continuing; to Cameraman)
		What are you lookin' at? I was the
		morning anchor in Houston! And I'm

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy
carefully turns to her mother.

		What if something goes wrong?

				MRS. HAN
			(firmly)
		It won't.



INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair.

				CARSON
		I'm going to the kidnapping site.

				MIRANDA
		I want to talk to the witnesses.

Colonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him.

				CARSON
		Great, we'll hire a bus.

They leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand.

		That's what I'm trying to get.
		They're saying I need a subpoena.

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.

We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some
Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.



INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.

Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote-
control boxes. He picks up his radio.

				ROBBINS
			(into radio)
		A lot of the components are made by

		security company.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Jump a copter to the Consulate. See
		if the manufacturer sells to the
		public. Find out what shops use their
		stuff; put people on the phones with
		a description of the perp.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

NEW ANGLE

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.

				YOUNG COP
		Inspector! Look at this...
			(reads from shell)
		"Dragon's Breath..?"



				CARSON
		Twelve-gauge shell filled with
		magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's
		worse than napalm -- Geneva
		Convention outlawed it for warfare.

				MIRANDA
		Then how did he get it?

				CARSON
		Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.
			(looks around)
		Where's the Consulate's car?

				YOUNG COP
			(beat)
		Uh... apparently it was stolen...

				COLONEL LEE
		Stolen!? What is it with you
		people --

				YOUNG COP
			(angry)
		-- What's this "you people" shit?

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Shut up!

				MIRANDA
			(aside; to Young Cop)
		He means all of us "you people."

				CARSON
			(to Young Cop)
		Find it! How many bulletproof
		Mercedes could be cruising around
		Crenshaw?

				YOUNG COP
		You'd be surprised...

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Ambassador Han, Walther and Sabatini are looking at a series
of high-definition faxes spread out on a table.

Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.

				CARSON
		Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was
		working alone, and he was a vicious
		son of a bitch. Old news.

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Ambassador Han)
		And our car was stolen.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I felt safer when I was the
		Ambassador to Libya.

				SABATINI
		Image enhancements came back.

POV OF PICTURES

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

				CARSON
		We going steady?



				SABATINI
		The sun position tells us the
		windows are facing northeast.
			(beat)
		Here's the best -- look at the glass
		on the prints hanging in the
		background. There's a reflection of
		a reflection, out on the street: the
		corner of a billboard.

				CARSON
		Looks like the wheel of a car.

				MIRANDA
		We talked about these billboards,
		when we were car shopping! Four-
		door... they make a wagon, too.
			(beat)
		Something Japanese... God, what was
		it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You
		thought it had no character.

				CARSON
		I thought that about all of them.
		C'mon, think, dammit!!

				MIRANDA
		You think!! You were there, too!

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

				CARSON
		Call the outdoor advertising
		companies. Get the location of all
		the billboards for Japanese cars
		within our search parameters.

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

				DAVE
			(into phone)
		...Peerless Auto Security. We need
		to know whether you've sold a large

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY

General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major
Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the
others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call
with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.

							CUT TO:

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device.

				OPERATIVE
			(urgently; into device)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped! It was switched by
		order of --

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"
button on the uplink device before dying.

On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then
another GUNSHOT destroys it.

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative
over with his foot.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is
trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.

				MRS. HAN
		He asked you if you had to go...

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

				JOY
		Oh, my God...

The meters are hovering just below the red...



SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,
still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the
tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
		using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.



				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
			(continuing)
		Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
		they attacked a Genoese fort, and
		catapulted infected corpses over the
		walls. The Genoese who survived
		carried the disease back to Europe...
		and it killed half the population.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Get to the goddamn point, Major.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

				CIA CHIEF
		Seems the missile is armed with a
		warhead carrying the Pneumonic
		Plague.

The President goes nuts.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
		to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
		What happened to this "limited
		retaliation" shit?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		The North Koreans insist the missile
		carries a conventional payload. They
		say we're trying to trick them into
		aborting the attack.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Especially since the uplink from our
		Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.

				CIA CHIEF
		We think one of the Hard-liners
		switched the warhead without the
		Premier's knowledge. But he's not
		about to take our word for it, and
		he's too weak to risk the
		humiliation of backing down.

				PRESIDENT
			(incredulous; thru video
			link)
		They use a biological weapon on
		American soil, they have to know
		we'll respond!



				SECRETARY OF STATE
		Maybe they don't think we got the
		guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
		they think they can whip us, like
		what happened in 'Nam. Look who
		we're dealing with: a teetering,
		outlaw regime, and inside it, some
		wild-ass renegades working their
		screwy agenda!

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		We've deployed Marines from Pendleton
		and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.
		Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,
		but it's 40 minutes before they're on
		the ground.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		All right. Assuming the worst...
		What'll happen?

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The warhead vents the plague
		bacteria above the target area,
		infecting about 50,000 people. First
		symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes
		become swollen; temperature rises to
		105. Victims turn deep purple from
		lung hemorrhaging, usually die the
		same day.
			(beat)
		There are treatments -- streptomycin
		and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
		overwhelmed by the numbers and its
		extreme contagiousness.

				CIA CHIEF
		We could have 500,000 infected in a
		week, who knows how many after that.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have
		the Summit leaders been warned?



				FBI CHIEF
		Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
		'til we give the all-clear.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		And you're sure it's safe if we can
		get 'em to destroy the missile in
		flight?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The bacteria can't survive the heat
		of an explosion.

				CIA CHIEF
		I suggest none of this go any
		further -- not even to the agents
		working to find the family. Word
		leaks out to a city of 12 million
		people there's rocket full of the
		Plague coming at 'em, you'll create
		a panic of biblical proportions.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is painfully on edge. Ambassador Han paces. The FBI

Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.

				COLONEL LEE
		Perhaps someone will decide it is
		foolish to incur the wrath of North
		Korea.

				CARSON
			(crosses to Colonel Lee)
		Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole

				WALTHER
		Carson...

				CARSON
		Let's grab a few beers, kick back

		Why wait until five?

Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from
going at each other.

				MIRANDA
		Pete!

		Christ, you're self-indulgent!
		There's nothing but anger and

				CARSON
		Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep

		searches to areas around high-rises.



				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Where's that fuckin' address?!

				DAVE
		I'm still holdin'!

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM
connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the
keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair
longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		He's on our hit parade. Interpol
		passed us his records when he
		entered the country.
			(reads)
		French by birth... looks like a total
		scumbag.

				SABATINI
		Isn't that redundant?

				DAVE
			(reads from computer)
		Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;
		served some short stretches, petty
		shit... arrested for kidnapping, no
		conviction. Did four years in France
		for blowing bank vaults. Moved to
		U.S. last year. Clean since then.

				CARSON
		Get his Driver's License number;
		Social; bank accounts; charge cards;
		club memberships... find out what
		movies he rented.  Get whoever's
		closest to the Auto Shop to get in
		there, interview everybody.

				MIRANDA
		This sure was a ballsy move for a
		car-alarm installer.

				CARSON
		Hey, he watched the news... Everyone
		knows the U.S. will do anything to
		avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.

They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard.

				MIRANDA
		Ambassador --



				CARSON
		-- Quit apologizing for me!

				MIRANDA
		Quit giving me reasons to!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Carson)
		On occasion, my wife has been known
		to kick my ankle under the table.

Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.

				CARSON
		Sounds like her aim's a little low.

Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a
piece of paper.

				DAVE
		Address, according to the Auto Shop.

				CARSON
			(looks at paper)
		Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!
		Sabatini -- you're with us.
			(off Robbins' disappointed
			look)
		She's got the field experience.

Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.

				MIRANDA
		There still could be accomplices.
		If there are, they'll hear us in
		the helicopter.

Carson looks again at the address...

				CARSON
		There's a TV station a couple blocks
		away. We'll land on their pad.
			(to Robbins)
		K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a
		SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to
		hang back unless we need 'em.

EXT.  OSAKA, JAPAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

SUPER: Osaka. Western Japan.

INT.  OSAKA APARTMENT - DAY

In the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair-bound JAPANESE TEENAGER,
computers and HAM RADIO equipment are stacked everywhere.

He turns on a tape recorder. We hear a faint, crackling VOICE:



				OPERATIVE'S VOICE (VO)
			(on recorder)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped!

The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks
the CHAT icon, types: "Anyone up on their spy terminology?"

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

With the gardeners gone, and their sound sensors disabled,
Mrs. Han, Joy and Sam are SHOUTING for help.

They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.

EXT.  K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter
lands right next to it.

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on
the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,
videotaping everything.

				CARSON
		Oh, great, the media...
			(realizing)
		It's the goddamn traffic girl!

				MIRANDA
		Traffic person.

				BOBBI
		Where are you going?

				CARSON
		We can't get into that right now...

				BOBBI
		Hey, you expect to use my station's
		facilities and not even tell us --

Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and
crushes the tape.

				MIRANDA
			(to Bobbi)
		Sorry...



				BOBBI
			(looks Miranda over)
		What the fuck are you, the Barbie
		Corporate Ass-Lick model?

Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket
and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi
by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.

				MIRANDA
		Guess what, Sister... you're about
		to spend the next five years in a
		penitentiary for interfering with a
		federal investigation.

The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.

				STATION MANAGER
		Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their
		news blackout!

				BOBBI
			(to herself)
		Figures... you dickless wonder.

Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his
wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.

The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.

				STATION MANAGER
		I get an exclusive later, right?

				CARSON
		This works out, I'll play the
		fuckin' banjo for you.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food,
wine and beer... and crank up the Beach Boys TUNES.

Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high
rises -- Century City, Westwood, downtown, etc.

EXT.  U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa.

Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight
line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts.

They begin to TAKE OFF...



EXT.  FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY

The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.

Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped
vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners --
until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

				CARSON
		We're hoofing it.

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

				SABATINI
			(pissed)
		'She's got the field experience'...
		To park the fuckin' car!

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

				CARSON
			(pulls out his i.d.)
		Whoa... FBI..!

They lower their weapons.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		How the hell you get here so fast?



				SWAT TEAM #1
		They're shootin' a cop movie down
		the street. We're workin' as extras.

				CARSON
		Terrific. Who else is here?

				SWAT TEAM #1
		Three officers on the roof, next
		building over, and two in the tenth-
		floor hallway.

				CARSON
		Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
			(to Concierge)
		Give me your master key.

EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.

				SWAT TEAM #1
			(thru radio)
		Feds going up -- Anglo male and
		female; Asian male.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

				WOMAN
		What the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

				CARSON
			(to Miranda)
		Wait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
		while I look around.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

				MIRANDA
		I like what you've done with the
		place...



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

				COLONEL LEE
		Wait!

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

				SABATINI
		Where's Carson?

				COLONEL LEE
		Inside.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

				CARSON
		NO! --

Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

				CARSON
		I said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

				MIRANDA
		Stop it!

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Get out of my sight.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful
Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.

				BOBBI
			(into phone)
		Marchfelder.

				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(thru phone)
		You dated the Mayor, right?

				BOBBI
			(sighs; into phone)
		You need a traffic ticket fixed?



				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(excited; thru phone)
		Try to confirm something for us.
		There's an incredible buzz on the
		Internet -- someone picked up a
		classified message on a U.S.
		Intelligence frequency. We think
		it's authentic!

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,
as the festivities really start rockin'.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		What's the status?

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Wilshire and West PD Divisions had
		seven vehicles running with sirens at
		9:32. They're getting the routes from
		the officers now.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Hurry it the hell up.

He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		I should've known she'd come up.

				MIRANDA
		Pete --

				CARSON
		-- "Should've." Shit, there's a
		familiar word.
			(long beat)
		That day... I was there soon enough.
		We should've rushed 'em, before they
		could finish setting up...



				MIRANDA
		The Bureau never would've let you.
		They want it by the book: talk them
		out.

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
		Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.

				MIRANDA
		You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your
		decision. You can't keep living as
		such a raw nerve, never sleeping --

				CARSON
		-- Those kids were ten years old!
			(sotto)
		Same age as the Han boy...

He turns away. She takes his hand.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we

							CUT TO:



INT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,
construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.

A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:
     
		This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated
		For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

				CARSON
		C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
		records? What about cross-referencing
		possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

				MIRANDA
		Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
			(reaches for phone)
		Where are the numbers for the
		outdoor ad companies?

				ROBBINS
		Parker Center's making those calls.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:

				BOBBI
		Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!

				CAMERAMAN
		Maybe it's true... probably is true.
		That's why they got a news blackout!

				BOBBI
		I'll rip your miserable eyeballs
		out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!

He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...A warning was radioed to U.S.
		Intelligence that a biological weapon,
		allegedly containing the deadly
		Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los
		Angeles. While unconfirmed, the
		President and other leaders are all
		late in arriving...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.

				DAVE
		Finally got the call list from
		Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
		they're from the legit user who
		didn't know his number was cloned.

				CARSON
		Go to the bottom of the list, work
		back through the last 12 hours.

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

				DAVE
		Here's the call to the Consulate --
		965-5000.
			(while scrolling)
		The rest are dupes... all from the
		other guy...

				CARSON
		Wait... go back... the one at seven
		this morning...

Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.

WIDER

Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.

(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE

from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.

(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."



BACK TO SCENE

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

				CARSON
		Get down!

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		MIRANDA!

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

				MIRANDA
		Go..!

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and
severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a
drive in the country.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and
Ambassador Han gets in.

				CARSON
		Get the fuck out of here!

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson
sighs and tears out of the driveway.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then
hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,
zooming past the snarl of cars.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs
into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson looks around at the chaos around them.

				CARSON
		Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out
		here!

Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:



				FM NEWSCASTER (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...These words, which have terrified
		the city:

				RECORDING OF BOBBI (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...A biological weapon, allegedly

Stunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his
face in his hands.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Miranda..!

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I heard. I'm in the copter.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I want you to get out of here...

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is
beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Shut up and keep your eyes on the
		road. That's my goddamn car.
			(beat; into radio)
		Dave? You staying on top of the
		research?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while
hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He
grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		I can't... My kids...

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio; calmly)
		Listen: the best way to help them is
		to stay at your computer. If any
		information comes in, holler. Okay?

He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:



				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Okay...

EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Several large military helicopters approach -- troop
contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.

The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES
and ARMY INFANTRY.

Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to
follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the
helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.

We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,
Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of
pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the
heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --
in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he
HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY

Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps
off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

				BOBBI
		Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull
		back... show the other copters around
		us... this is fuckin' great...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.



				CARSON
		...The Colonel hired Javal, made it
		look like he was working alone. Then
		he made sure Javal got killed, so
		we'd never find your family -- and
		they'd have an excuse to drop their
		bomb. But what's in it for 'em?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There are men in my government whose
		power depends on North Korea staying
		as it is: Socialist, repressive,
		isolated from the world. They'll
		resort to anything, even war, to
		keep it that way. They have the
		Hitler Syndrome: if their country
		cannot exist the way they want it,
		they would rather see it destroyed.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto
the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.

				VREELAND (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We've got the situation in hand.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into
the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.



INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper
body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable
S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.

Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel
Lee, but there's no time...

				VREELAND
			(to Pilot)
		Shit! Pull back!

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a
rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the
Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two
tons of red-hot shrapnel.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.

				BOBBI
			(to TV camera)
		Jesus fuckin' God!!!
			(beat; smiles)
		Uh, I think we're gonna set down
		now. Back to you, Brent.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-
mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.

Hot metal and debris PINGS and POPS as it rains over the
neighborhood, sending cars and pedestrians rushing for cover.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - DAY

Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.

				VREELAND
			(into radio)
		Out of the air, or retreat 7,000
		meters from target vehicle!

The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.
Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming
them in an attempt to leave the city.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks
back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.

				JOY
		I always hated that guy...

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the
biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee
squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson
looks at Ambassador Han:

				CARSON
		One of yours?

		What the hell do you need heat-
		seeking rockets for in L.A.?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There could be another riot...

				CARSON
			(shakes his head)
		And they call me Mr. Overkill.
			(into radio)
		Dave, what do you know about...

He looks at Han.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Strela-2...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A
schematic of Colonel Lee's rocket launcher appears on it.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda has hitched a ride in a black-and-white.

			(into radio)
		Stay back. LAPD's putting up a
		roadblock.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP
BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.

They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then
stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their
huge front shovels to create a roadblock.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY

Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...

WIDER

The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.

Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a
KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...

Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY
stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the
copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:

				BOBBI
		Save it for someone who gives a
		shit!



EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.
So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.

MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and
hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking
lots.

PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and
windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,
angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.

The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.
Carson catches up to it.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to
		arm, so stay tight on his ass.

Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han
braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.



				CARSON
		That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses
		you'd like to tell me about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I don't think so -- they said it was
		solid as a rock.

				CARSON
			(looks at his crumpled car)
		No shit...

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(dazed)
		I can't believe I'm still alive...

				CARSON
		This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

				CARSON
		Get me out of here...

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Anybody see him?

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Still heading north on the 110.

The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador
Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Dave... You're sure those rockets
		are heat-seeking?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Classic IR, reflective optical

		Just keep working your leads...

Carson climbs into the back of the ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE - DAY

Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking
for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		This is Carson. I need a copter.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY

Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard,
Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Something small and nimble.
		Anybody... come in low, from the
		south... I'm on an ambulance by the
		9th Street exit.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Are you out of your mind?

INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the
minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her
Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs
the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:



				BOBBI
		Get this fuckin' thing in the air!
			(to Cameraman)
		Out! Not enough room for four.

				CAMERAMAN
			(as they TAKE OFF)
		What am I supposed to do when the
		plague comes, hold my breath?

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

They rapidly cut through the traffic.

		Switch to a secure channel.

		What on earth are you thinking?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I'll make him open the sunroof.
		Someone can shoot tear gas or a

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or
		anything on me, have you?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		No way. I couldn't stand making so
		many people happy.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.

				CARSON
		You?! I wanted a police copter!

				PILOT
		Just tell me what to do. I flew two
		tours in 'Nam.



				BOBBI
		And he doesn't go unless I go!

				CARSON
		Wrong-o...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!

WIDER

They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.
Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

BOBBI

surfaces, sputtering and screaming:

				BOBBI
		I'm a respected electronic
		journalist, you fuckin' prick!!

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of
Mylanta out after her.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

In the distance, there is smog on the horizon.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes
cutting across lanes.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Got 'im -- looks like he's headed
		for the 101.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.



				CARSON
			(to Pilot)
		Pull hard to the left, on my
		signal...

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

				CARSON
		Now!

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda sees what Carson is doing.

				MIRANDA
		You fucking lunatic!!

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The News Pilot looks over at Carson.

				PILOT
		Hope you got more flares than he's
		got rockets.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...



EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

VARIOUS ANGLES

As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.



				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

				MIRANDA
		You're completely deranged! Playing
		chicken with rockets!

				CARSON
		Well, what the hell were you doing
		out there?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		What are both of you doing?

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

				CARSON
		Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.

				MIRANDA
		Even if we can pry him out with...
			(looks at her watch)
		Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
		be very cooperative.

				CARSON
		I'll just use my outstanding people
		skills.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Ambassador
			Han)
		That car's like a rock, right?

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.



INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY

Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

CLOSER

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.



				MIRANDA
		Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
		Well, these are fuck you pumps!
			(pushes harder)
		Where's the family?

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on
his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.

				DAVE
		Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned

He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.

				DAVE
			(continuing; into phone)
		You're sure there were no accounts in
		the other names I gave you?

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Let him up.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

				COLONEL LEE
		Victory!

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

WIDER

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.



EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

No answer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on
the complex from all directions.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

				VOICE THRU PA
		Han family. Show us your location...

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

				JOY
		Mother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

				MRS. HAN
		Do it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.

				MILTON
		It's a brown binder... Says "Rental
		Manifest." You can't miss it...

They literally tear the office apart.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The coast looms closer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

				CARSON
		Okay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

				LISA
		Hurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

				CARSON
		DON'T!

He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		We have to go out the window.

				MRS. HAN
		Can't you disarm the bomb?



				CARSON
		Too risky. Let's concentrate on
		getting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Sound detectors?

				MRS. HAN
		Sam covered them with chewing gum.

				SAM
		High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

				CARSON
		Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
		convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
		seat, he sets the alarm off. These
		are rigged backwards -- get up, you
		set 'em off.

				SAM
		You a bomb expert?

				CARSON
		Nope. But I've had some car alarms
		in my day.
			(to himself)
		For all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
		Slide your arm forward... Watch the
		meter... Keep the pressure on the
		armrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
		the weight of your arm... Okay...
		pick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



				CARSON
			(continuing; to Sam)
		Low-tech solution...
			(to Mrs. Han)
		Lean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio in his pocket)
		How's it going in there?

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Nag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

WIDER

The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

				CARSON
		You'll be over in five seconds...

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.

One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

CARSON

sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

ANGLE ON BOMB

Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

THE HARNESS

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

		Release the cable from your side!

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.

All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

CARSON

is engulfed in the FIREBALL... We can't tell if he's alive.

INT./EXT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.

BELOW

Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

WIDER

Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air;
helicopters crisscross the scene.

Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile...



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - (INCLUDE TV) -
DAY

The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at
Park LaBrea on CNN Live...

...As Ambassador Han embraces his family.

Furious, General Kai gets up and leaves the conference room.

The others look at the Premier. After a beat, he crosses to a
PANEL OF ELECTRONICS and SLAPS a large red button on it...

EXT.  SKY ABOVE SANTA MONICA - DAY

The cruise missile EXPLODES, completely obliterating it.

EXT.  U.S. FIGHTER BOMBERS - SKY OVER SEA OF JAPAN - DAY

The lead jet cuts away, turning around. The others follow.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The Han family crosses to Carson, blackened and bloody,
sitting on the curb next to Miranda. Ambassador Han shakes
his hand. Mrs. Han and Miranda cry. Joy and Sam grin at him.
After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms. It is a
profound catharsis for him...

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - DAY

General Kai is getting into his car. He look up as an ARMY
OFFICER approaches... and SHOOTS him! The Officer pushes his
body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off.

							FADE THRU TO:

DARKNESS

and the sound of RUNNING WATER.

EXT.  PASTORAL SCENE - DAY

A beautiful ranch house and horse barn, sitting on a meadow
beside a brook, overlooking an unspoiled pine forest.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV.

Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		...I'll call you next week.

Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room.
The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO - NIGHT

Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is WATERING her sickly roses.
Carson comes outside.

				MIRANDA
		Who was that on the phone?

				CARSON
		The Bureau.
			(beat)
		They want me back on the hostage
		team.

				MIRANDA
		What did you say?

				CARSON
		Told 'em I'd sleep on it...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

				MIRANDA
		Working with you today was
		certainly... interesting, Inspector.

				CARSON
		It's my outstanding people skills.

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

				MIRANDA
		I hate this fucking town...

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...

							FADE OUT.
Rush Hour 2

 


















					RUSH HOUR 2

					BY

					Jeff Nathanson

































	EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

	A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
	watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
	a half million people a day.

	EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

	THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

	HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
	VENDOR across the street.

	She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:

	THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

	TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
	a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
	street vendor.

				HU LI
			(Chinese, subtitled)
		Someone better call the police.

	EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
	a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
	dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
	look to two girls in a convertible.

				CARTER
			(int Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

	The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
	is driving and singing to his radio.

				LEE
			(singing)
		...wish they all could be California...
		wish they all could be California
		girls...

	Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
	out of the SUNROOF.

				CARTER
		I warned you about playing that shit
		when I'm in the car.

				LEE
		That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
		Chinese man's CD.

				CARTER
		Did you see the way those girls drove
		off?  I did you a favor.

				LEE
		Those girls drove off because of you.

				CARTER
		All I did was invite them for a drink.

				LEE
		You invited them to get naked and
		sacrifice a small goat.

				CARTER
			(checking Chinese-English
			 dictionary)
		I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

	Lee picks up his CD case.

				LEE
		You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
		Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

				CARTER
		Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
		been here three days and we haven't done
		shit.  We haven't been to a club,
		haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on
		vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

				LEE
		Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

				CARTER
		Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some
		women.  Now stop playing dumb and show
		me the shu!

	Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over
	LEE'S CELL PHONE.

	INTERCUT

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, there was a bombing at the American
		Embassy.  Two American translators were
		killed.

				LEE
		Any leads?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(beat)
		We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
		want to take the case, I'll understand.

				LEE
		It's my responsibility.

	Lee hangs up the cell phone.

				CARTER
		What was that?  Did you just pick up a
		case?  Did we just take another damn
		case on my vacation?

	Lee smiles at Carter.

				LEE
		Of course not.  My Superindendent
		invited us to a club tonight.  Big
		party.

				CARTER
		Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will
		kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard
		you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

				LEE
		Carter, would I lie to you?
						
			EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
	way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
	hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
	when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

				CARTER
		That's what I'm talking about.  A real
		Hong Kong night club.  You want an
		Altoid?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		You better take one.  Your breath has
		been a little funky all day.  Let me
		look at you.

	Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just relax and don't worry about a
		thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You
		got condoms?

				LEE
		No.  

				CARTER
		Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
		it in half.

	Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
	GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
	to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
	a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
	Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

				LEE
		I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		They don't like tourists in here, so try
		to blend in.

				CARTER
		Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than
		everyone here.  Where you going?

				LEE
		Bathroom.

	Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

				CARTER
		How you boys doing tonight?

	The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	OLD MAN continues to sing.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That is the worst singing I've ever
		heard.  That sounds like something you'd
		hear in prison after lights out.

	The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
	door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
	MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

				CARTER (V.O.)
		Get closer to my body now.  And just
		love me, till you don't know how...

	Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
	realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
	YOU GET ENOUGH."

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
	watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
	Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
	few of the smitten women who are watching him.

				LEE
			(whispering from side of stage)
		Carter, get off that stage!

				CARTER
		Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
		star, Lee.  A god to these people!

	Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
	the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

				LEE
		This is a gangster bar, we're here
		undercover.

				CARTER
		I knew you were lying.

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		Damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
		I'm just starting to have fun.
			(beat)
		Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
		badge and do your thing.

				LEE
		No, we're here for information, to find
		out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
		must tread softly and keep our ears
		open.

				CARTER
		Tread softly?  Who taught you how to
		roost a bar?

				LEE
		Carter, you don't understand.  These men
		are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
		most deadly gang in China.

				CARTER
		Man, are you crazy?  You think that
		scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
		gangs.  We were having gang wars before
		anybody even thought about it.  We get
		royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
		your badge and gun and I'll show you how
		it's done.

				LEE
		No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
		Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

				CARTER
		You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
		last night.

	Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
	Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
		lui.

	Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
	Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(whispering)
		What'd I say?

				LEE
		You just said you're their worst
		nightmare - and to line their mothers up
		for a milking.

				CARTER
		Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
		out.

	Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
	as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let's try this again.  Who here knows
		Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Now I know you're lying.  

	The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
	spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(as they run out)
		I come back and catch y'all singing
		Michael Jackson and you're all going to
		jail.

	EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
	and several gangsters round a corner.

				CARTER
		Stop!  LAPD!

	Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
	GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
	under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
	Their only way out is UP.

	Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
	them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
	VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

				CARTER
		Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

	Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
	CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
	LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
	pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

	BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
	to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

	WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
	CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Forget this...

	He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
	come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
	after the GANGSTER LEADER.

	ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

	Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
	the hill.

	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

	Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
	WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
	OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

	HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

	As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
	OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

				CARTER
			(out of breath)
		Freeze!  Nobody move!

	Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
	Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

	She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
	ROOF!

	He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
	the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

	LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

	They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
	Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
	She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

	CARTER AND LEE

	holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
	to bend.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

				LEE
		Try to land on your feet.

	Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

				CARTER
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit.

	The POLE BREAKS
			
	SUPER THE TITLE:

	RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

	INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

	Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in
	silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

				CARTER
		You lied to me. 

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		You're sorry.  I got somebody's old
		chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
		tell me you're sorry.  Just take me
		home.

				LEE
		No time.  There was an explosion at the
		American Embassy today -- two American
		translators were killed.

	Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

				CARTER
		So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
		up the Embassy?

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

	Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
	year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

	MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

				CARTER
		I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
		this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -
		let one of them be your partner.

				LEE
		This won't take long. 

	Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

				MASTER FU
		Dragon kick!

	Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Lotus block!

	The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu
	notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Twisting Tiger!

	No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
			(staring straight at Lee)
		Twisting Tiger!

	Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
	that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in
	the glow...

	...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Didn't I teach you to always arch your
		back?

				LEE
			(bowing, humbled)
		Yes, Master.

	While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
	YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

				CARTER
		I was watching you kids.  My name is
		Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
		black belt.  At least that's what I tell
		the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
		where I work out.

	Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
	reaction.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me give you kids some tips.  The key
		to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why
		don't you stand up.

	THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw
	punches.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show
		you how to block.  Come on, stand up,
		give me your best shot -- try to kick
		right to my head.

	The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
	HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
	to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of
	the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That's pretty good.  Which one of you
		kids did that?

	INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Master Fu walking.

				LEE
		I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a
		man who used to train with you.  He's
		become a killer - the worst kind of
		animal.

				MASTER FU
		Animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
		The man you seek is lower than a
		serpent.  
			(faces Lee)
		...he kills for money.

	In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
	disappear O.S.

	Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
	thought.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		He was the best I ever trained, you
		know.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan?

				MASTER FU
		No.  Your father.
			(Lee reacts)
		Your father and Ricky Tan were my
		favorite students... and for such awful
		things to happen as they did --

	Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
	uncomfortable.

				LEE
		How do I find Ricky Tan?

	AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by
	in the other direction, disappear O.S.

	Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

				MASTER FU
		A seeding spends its entire life
		reaching towards Heaven.

				LEE
		I know, Master, but...

				MASTER FU
		The answers you seek can be found in
		Heaven on Earth.

				LEE
		Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't
		understand.
			(working it)
		A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A
		mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

				MASTER FU
		It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven
		on Earth."  You will find your answers
		there.

	Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
	pathway.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

	Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
	Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Cheap bastard...

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
	students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
	locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
	hands, and sitting on the last one.

				CARTER
		And that's how you use the LAPD choke
		hold.  Now start practicing and don't
		make me come back here!

				LEE
		Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

				LEE
		Just follow my lead and act like a
		tourist.

				CARTER
		I am a tourist.

	INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand
	in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 

				HOSTESS
		Good afternoon, gentlemen.

	Lee bows, followed by Carter.

				LEE
			(in Chinese)
		Hello.

				CARTER
		How you doin'?

				LEE
		My friend is on vacation, from America. 
		I want to show him a good time.

				HOSTESS
		Oh, you American?

				CARTER
		That's right.

				HOSTESS
		You bring American money?

				CARTER
			(holding up a Platinum AmEx)
		Never leave home without it.
			(to Lee)
		Lee, this one's on me.  You save your
		money.

	The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN
	SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL
	WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

				HOSTESS
		You get massage from Chinese girl
		before?

				CARTER
		No.  It's my first time.

				HOSTESS
		You pick any girl for you and your
		friend.

	Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

				CARTER
		Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that
		one.

				HOSTESS
		Oh yes, she's very nice.

				CARTER
		She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm
		gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take
		that one, too.  How you doin', baby? 
		And...that one in pink.  She can do my
		feet.

	Lee elbows Carter.

				LEE
		What are you doing?

				CARTER
		She said I could pick any girl I want.

				LEE
		Well, hurry up.

				CARTER
		Hey!  You don't break in front of a
		black man in a buffet line.

				HOSTESS
			(to Lee)
		Your friend have big appetite.
			(handing ROBES to Lee and
			 Carter)
		Please put these on and wait upstairs in
		the quiet room.

	INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women
	massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's
	showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
	background. 

	Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
	PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
	TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

				CARTER
		Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come
		through, Lee.

	LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
	SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of
	sophistication and brutality.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				LEE
		Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

				CARTER
		That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. 
		I'll go over with you right now, shake
		him down.

				LEE
		This is a very dangerous man.

				CARTER
		I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna
		ruin my massage because of some midget
		in a house coat.

				LEE
		I'm calling for back up!

	Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

	Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
	with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a
	decision, gets up and walks towards him.

				CARTER
		Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
		for you.  Get up.

	Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

				RICKY TAN
		I'm busy at the moment.

				CARTER
		I said get on your feet!

				RICKY TAN
		I know you, Detective Carter, right? 
		You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying
		your visit?

				CARTER
		I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
		and don't let the robe fool you.  This
		is the only color they had left.  Now
		get up!

	Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
	from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
	against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
	around the room waiting to move.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I told you to get on your feet!

	Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
	breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

				RICKY TAN
		Lee, I've missed you, brother.
			(getting up, giving Lee a hug)
		I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
		sorry, you must be under great pressure.

				LEE
		You must come with me for questioning.

				CARTER
		Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken
		and hot oil waiting for me.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think so...

	A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
	towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
	Lee and Carter.  A beat...

				CARTER
		I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

				RICKY TAN
		It's no problem.  But I must excuse
		myself, inspector.

				CARTER
		That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

	Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

				RICKY TAN
		Congratulations.  And good day.

	As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
	But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

	Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
	covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

				CARTER
			(ref: his privates)
		Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

	Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
	Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
	throwing him out the front door.

	Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
	their shoulders.

	EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

	Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies
	open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway. 
	Both men are completely naked.

	EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

	A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
	people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
	behind.

				CARTER
		Goddamn you got a small ass.

				LEE
		Don't look at my ass!

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

	PANDEMONIUM

	The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET
	SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
	bullpen.

	SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
	50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Chin, you have been ordered by the
		Ministry of Public Security to assist
		the FBI and Secret Service with our
		investigation, to provide us with
		whatever we need.  If you have
		information, it belongs to us.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		This is still Hong Kong.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Two Americans have been killed on United
		States Government property -- this is
		our investigation.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
		people...

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		No.  He will report to me.  Do we
		understand each other?

	SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. 
	Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
	can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
		Who the hell is that?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(humiliated)
		That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The
		detective in charge of our
		investigation.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to
		talk to the great Inspector Lee.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting
	on a suit and fixing his tie. 
	Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
	Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

				LEE
		Where are you going?

				CARTER
		Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn
		passport back.  I'm going home.

				LEE
		Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

				CARTER
		Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,
		so I backed you up.  I was about to take
		out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

				LEE
		Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

				CARTER
		My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes
		to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
		I'm not the one who goes to massage
		parlors to bust crime lords!

				LEE
		It's my job!

				CARTER
		You're pathetic, man.  When's the last
		time you had some fun?  When's the last
		time you took a night off, had a date?

				LEE
		I have plenty of dates.

				CARTER
		Really?  When's the last time you had
		some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when
		was it?  Year of the rat?

				LEE
		You would never understand my life. 
		You're not Chinese.

				CARTER
		And you ain't black!

	The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly
	walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half
	dressed.

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin
	stands in the back.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
		the United States Secret Service.

				LEE
		The Secret Service?  Why?

				STERLING
		What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
		this room.  The men who were killed
		yesterday were not American translators. 
		They were undercover U.S. customs agents
		trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. 
		We don't know what they're transporting
		out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
		got the agents killed.

				LEE
		How can we help?

				STERLING
		Stay the hell out of our way.

				LEE
		I can get to Ricky Tan.

				STERLING
		We know all about Tan.  That's why we're
		leaving him out there as bait.  We think
		this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
		and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks
	he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

				CARTER
		Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. 
		I'm on a car phone!

	INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong
		Kong right now?

				CARTER
		Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm
		in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and
		Vine, two minutes from the station.  How
		about I pick you up right now and take
		you to dinner?

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		It's nine-thirty in the morning.

				CARTER
		Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. 
		Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Do you know what happened yesterday,
		Carter?  I was officially nominated for
		the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. 
		There was a dinner last night, two
		hundred LAPD officers were there.

				CARTER
		Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez
		there?  He owes me money.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		I've waited my whole life for this job,
		but I don't have a shot in hell of
		getting it.  Do you know why?

				CARTER
		Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You
		tell them there's no crime in being
		lonely.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is
		because the entire department is about
		to find out the stolen credit cards we
		impounded were used to buy two first
		class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what
		the hell is Heaven on Earth?

				CARTER
		Sir, I'm working on a big case over here
		-- and by the time I get back they're
		gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you
		there?  Hello?  Shit!

	As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is
	standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY
	PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
	outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
	tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
	LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

				CARTER
		How you doing?  Can you direct me to the
		Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  

	The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
	filled with birds.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my
		birds dead and deep fried.  You ever
		been to Popeyes?

	The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. 
		I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
		just put the blade down and let the bird
		go.

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own
	office - but never gets there.

	AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. 
	Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
	head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his
	destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

	STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around
	Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the
	crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back
	by the heat.

				LEE
		Carter!  CARTER!

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

	Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
	BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
	store.

				CARTER
		How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven
		on Earth.

	The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

	ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
		zi.

				MAN
		You wish to spank my sister with a ping
		pong paddle?

				CARTER
		No man, I was just asking...

				MAN
		Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

	As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

	Pause.

	Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
	if it's worth staying...

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

	Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin
	approaches.

				LEE
		All he wanted was some mu-shu.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Are you okay, Lee?

	Beat.

				LEE
		I'm sorry, I have to go.

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

	Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
	for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks
	to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
	waiting Daimler.

	The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the
	street with a determined look on his face.

				CARTER
		I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

	Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

	INT. TAXI - EVENING

	The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

				CARTER
			(loud)
		Follow that limo.

	The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You understand what I'm saying?  Follow
		that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This
		is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
			(beat)
		We are still parked -- we're not moving! 
		This is the opposite of chasing -- drive
		the car or I will kill you!

	The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes
	in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

				CAB DRIVER
		Now you speak my language.
			
	INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

	Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. 
	Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in
	tribute to Carter.

	His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

	INTERCUT -- 

	INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, we just got a call from the harbor
		patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little
		party on his boat tonight.  Victoria
		harbor.  If you don't want to...

				LEE
		Did you tell Sterling?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Let him find out on his own.  I want the
		Hong Kong police handling this.

				LEE
		Thank you.

	Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC
	up, a man on a mission.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

	A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan
	walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
	crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

	Carter steps out of the cab.

				CARTER
		Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You
		understand?

				CAB DRIVER
		Yes.  I understand.

	Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
	leaving him alone on the docks.

	Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
	parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
	names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
	politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

	CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN
	HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

				DOORMAN #1
		Invitation, please.

				CARTER
		I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

				DOORMAN #1
		The band has been playing over an hour.

				CARTER
		I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. 
		Ricky here yet, I need to get his
		requests.

	As Carter walks past the doorman -- 

				DOORMAN #1
		Wait.

				CARTER
		Last party all he wanted was Sting --
		not one person danced.  Tonight I'm
		doing Superfreak, I don't care what he
		says.  Where is he?

				DOORMAN #1
		Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the
		help.

	Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

				CARTER
		Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the
		star.  That's my band up there -- I
		control the mood, the groove, the
		atmosphere.

	Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Can you do that?
			(man shakes head "no")
		That's why you're down here and I'm up
		there.  Now this is my party -- don't
		forget it!

	Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

	The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. 
	Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
	the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
	but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
	side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
	clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
	LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

	EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

	As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
	from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
	- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
	REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
	impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
	money. 
	He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
	Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
	as sociopath.

	Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
	hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
	for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

	Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
	stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
	champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

				CARTER
		How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince
		Mubutu from Nigeria.

				ISABELLA
		Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That
		seat is taken.

				CARTER
			(in mangled Spanish)
		San Juan!  You must know my good friend
		Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
		Elizondo.

				ISABELLA
			(in English)
		I don't think so.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
		in the best circles.  But hey, I
		understand.  Make yourself at home,
		Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever
		you want.  My ship is your ship.

				ISABELLA
		This is your ship?

				CARTER
		That's right.  I'm the owner, the
		Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

				ISABELLA
		El Capitan?

				CARTER
		I don't want to play games with you,
		Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself
		with you -- in one of those bathrooms
		over there in about five minutes.

				ISABELLA
		Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a
		beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

				CARTER
		Called?  What's my ship called?
			(he has no idea)
		Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
		Johnson.

				ISABELLA
		The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name
		on the back was "Red Dragon."

				CARTER
		Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

				ISABELLA
		I'm sure, because this is my friend's
		yacht.  And it's his party.

				CARTER
		Your friend's ship?
			(looking around)
		Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the
		wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason
		my keys didn't work.

				STEVEN REIGN
			(taking seat next to Isabella)
		Who's your friend?

				ISABELLA
		Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? 
		You're big time.  You own all them big
		hotels.  What are you doing in Hong
		Kong?

				STEVEN REIGN
			(ushering away Isabella)
		I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
		in the sights.

				ISABELLA
		Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

	Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. 
	Carter's watching.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a
	BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the
	throat, pushing him against the wall.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

				BODYGUARD #1
		Who's asking?

				LEE
		The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a
		detective today and he's not getting
		away with it.  Now where is he?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or
		we'll kick your lying ass!

	Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing
	right behind him.

				LEE
		Carter?

				CARTER
		Who died?

				LEE
		You.

				CARTER
		Detective Yu?  Never met him.

				LEE
		Not Yu.  You!

				CARTER
		Who?

				LEE
		Do you understand the words that are
		coming out of my mouth?

				CARTER
		Nobody understands the words that are
		coming out of your mouth.

				BODYGUARD #1
		Get your hands in the air.

	Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front
	of them with GUNS in hand.

				BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is expecting you.
			
			INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED
	and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen
	satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door
	and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

				RICKY TAN
		Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
		You can do it, big guy.

	ON TV

	We see Shaq miss his free throw.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. 
		I just lost five grand.

	Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Why don't we go on the deck, get some
		air...and some privacy.
			(to Hu Li)
		Leave us alone.

	Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Could you have your partner wait for us
		outside?

				CARTER
		I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I
		got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

				LEE
			(to Carter)
		I'll meet you on the main deck in ten
		minutes.

	Carter pulls Lee aside.

				CARTER
		What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

				LEE
		I'm okay, you go.

				CARTER
		Why the hell should you believe him?  He
		had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty
		shit.

				LEE
		Remember I told you my father was a
		policeman?
			(beat)
		Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		What the hell is going on here?

	No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns
	and walks the other way.

	EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

	Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

				RICKY TAN
		Despite what people suspect...what you
		suspect --

				LEE
		Don't.

	Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

				RICKY TAN
		... if your father were alive, I would
		be turning to him now.
			(beat)
		I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
		but I believe some of my people did.  My
		enemies are trying to frame me.
			(beat)
		There is a war going on within the
		Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My
		name has been written into the book of
		death.

				LEE
		The police can protect you.

				RICKY TAN
		Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal
		with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get
		me out of Hong Kong.

				LEE
		Tell me why they killed the customs
		agents.

				RICKY TAN
		There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
		Harbor...

	Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

	Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
	screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
	falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

	Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
	attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
	off the bodyguards.

	INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck
	above.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
	suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

	It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
	Hu Li with his leg.

				CARTER
		All right, get your hands up.

	Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
	one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
	Bodyguard #2.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Hu Li face off.

				CARTER
		You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give
		you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

	Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

	INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches
	his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

				LEE
		Hu Li!

	Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT
	starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the
	moving boat.

	Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the
	stern.
			
	EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
	watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

	Carter turns his head, sees --

	-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
	escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
	during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears
	back into the shadows.

	EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

	The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. 
	Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

	Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was
		our only bait, and now he's gone.  You
		finally got your revenge - at the
		expense of a U.S. Government
		investigation.

				CARTER
		What "revenge" is he talking about?

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
		you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
		a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
		off this case.  I don't ever want to see
		you again, you got that?

				CARTER
		Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
		you --

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going
		back to L.A.

				CARTER
		Fine with me.

	Sterling walks away disgusted.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
		fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

	Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin
	motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
	approach.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
			(to police officers)
		Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

				LEE
		I'll take him.

				CARTER
		Hell no.

	The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to
		you.

	Carter stalks off.

				LEE
		Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood
		for your bullshit.

	Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're
	about to come to blows.

				CARTER
		What are you gonna do about it,
		grasshopper?

				LEE
		I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

				CARTER
		Give me your best shot, you flat assed
		mama's boy.

				LEE
		Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my
		ass!

				CARTER
		I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

				LEE
		No.  She's a school teacher.

				CARTER
		You're not very good at this, are you?

				LEE
		Good at what?   

				CARTER
		Forget it.

	A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

				LEE
		Five years ago, my father was Chief
		Inspector working a big international
		smuggling case.

				CARTER
		Ask me if I give a shit.

	Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan killed my father.

	Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		He found out his partner, Tan, had been
		working for the Triads all along.
			(beat)
		Before my father could prove it, he was
		killed in the line of duty.

				CARTER
		How the hell did Tan get away with it?

				LEE
		All the evidence against him
		disappeared, the smuggling case was
		unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to
		the Triads openly.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,
		Lee, you know my father died on the job. 
		You could have told me...
			(realizing)
		This is about more than all that, isn't
		it?  This is about your Daddy's last
		case, right?

	Lee's caught, fibs badly.

				LEE
		No, no, that would be crazy --

				CARTER
		You thought the "Customs Agents get
		blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
		Tan" and you put it all together and
		came up with a five year old case. 
		That's why you didn't tell me what we
		were doing...

				LEE
		I thought you'd think it was crazy.

				CARTER
		IT IS CRAZY!

				LEE
		I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

	Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
	car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and
	yells.

				CARTER
		So are you getting on the plane or not?!

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		Come on, we still got time to order the
		Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher
		meal, they bring it first.

				LEE
		I cannot go to LA...

	Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
	cop beneath the attitude.

				CARTER
		It sounds impossible --

				LEE
		You said --

				CARTER
		-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
		square up my father's death, I'd go to
		hell to do it.

	Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You want to figure out why they killed
		your Daddy, get on the plane.

				LEE
		Why LA?

				CARTER
			(still not turning)
		I guess you're going to have to trust me
		on this one.
			
			INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

	Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
	passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of
	doubt.

				LEE
		I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a
		boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

				CARTER
		Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
		Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
		the Rich White Man.

				LEE
		Follow the Rich White Man?

				CARTER
		Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
		White Man" all run together like it's
		one word.

				LEE
		Follow the RichWhiteMan...

				CARTER
		Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,
		has a rich white man taking his cut. 
		Every single one.  Now in our case, we
		know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

				LEE
		Who?

				CARTER
		Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky
		Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
		before Ricky got smoked.

				LEE
		How do you know he's our man?

				CARTER
		Because when the shooting started he was
		way too cool.  See most white people,
		when there's shooting, they either hide
		in a toilet or start screaming high
		pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

				LEE
		You sound like that all the time.

				CARTER
		Black people keep their cool when the
		shit goes down.

				LEE
		Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never
		panic.

				CARTER
		Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
		coming?  You people were screaming your
		asses off.

				LEE
		Just tell me where I can find this
		Steven Reign.

				CARTER
		The same place you find all
		RichWhiteMen.
			(a tray arrives)
		Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love
		this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

	CUT TO REVEAL --

	Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

	Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

	INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

	Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
	hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

	Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the
	penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven
	Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the
	door.

	Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
		Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
		his suite at his hotel, I told you this
		would work out.  They still just
		talking?

				LEE
		He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

				CARTER
		He'll be back soon.

				LEE
		How do you know?

				CARTER
		Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,
		I'll take over.

	Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
	sleep on the bed.

				LEE
		Carter, there's something I have to tell
		you.  You were right about what you said
		in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never
		take a day off.  It's all I have right
		now.

				CARTER
		Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

				LEE
		The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
		in six months.

				CARTER
		You pull a muscle or something?

				LEE
		My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
		month before our wedding.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

				LEE
		It's a long story.

				CARTER
		Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
		cop thing -- never knowing if you were
		dead or alive.  I've seen it a million
		times.

				LEE
		No.  It was my singing.

				CARTER
		Excuse me?

				LEE
		She hated my voice.  Said it drove her
		crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in
		bed - in the shower - I thought she
		liked it.  She finally told me it was
		driving her crazy.

	Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

				CARTER
		Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
		our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

	LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's she doing?

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

	She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
	CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee?  You okay?

	Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
	unbutton her blouse.

				LEE
		She's just standing around -- not doing
		much.

				CARTER
		Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later
		something's gonna happen.

				LEE
		I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

	Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat
	as he watches her undress.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Slow down, baby.

				CARTER
		What did you say?

				LEE
		Nothing.  I said nothing.

	Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Is it hot in here?

				CARTER
		Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

				LEE
		I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
		bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

				CARTER
		What's going on?  

	Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

				LEE
		She's getting undressed.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars.

				LEE
		No.  It's not right.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
		you.

	Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
	Carter watches to the window.

				LEE
		What's she doing?

				CARTER
		Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

				LEE
		I don't want to hear this.

				CARTER
		Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra
		and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring
		Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
		there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
		looks like Snoopy.

				LEE
		Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

				CARTER
		She just took her hair down.  Now she's
		going for the bra -- the clasp is in
		front -- she's using both hands.
			(to Lee)
		You better get that ice.

	Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

				LEE
		That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing
		this!

	Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
	living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in
	bra and panties.

				CARTER
		This is our job.  We took an oath as
		police officers.  If we don't do this,
		who will?  Firemen?

	Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees
	Isabella hang up the phone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Wait a sec - what the hell is that
		between her legs?

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		She's reaching into her panties --
		something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,
		God...please don't let it be a dick.

				LEE
		What is it?

				CARTER
		No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
		microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

	CLOSE ON ISABELLA

	As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She
	puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
	and puts on a robe.

				LEE
		I don't understand?

				CARTER
		She's walking back towards the door.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
	hotel room talking with someone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		She opened the door.  Someone is
		delivering a package.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
		package to your office.  It's a bomb!

	Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
	she walks into the bedroom --

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
	entrance of the hotel.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running
	down the hallway.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it
	up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING
	THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

				LEE/CARTER
		NO!

	Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
	panties.

				CARTER
		Damn girl, you fine.

	Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the
	BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
	toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
	floor.

	Nothing happens.

	Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
	CART, about to walk right past the package --

				LEE
		GET DOWN!!

	Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

				CARTER
		Pick it up!

				LEE
		It's your turn!

				CARTER
		I don't need a turn!

	Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
	heading for the elevator.

				LEE
		Throw it!

	Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
	STANDING INSIDE.

				HOTEL GUESTS
		Do you want us to hold the elevator?

				CARTER
		Get the hell away from here!

	Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
	with it --

				LEE
		Stairs!

	Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
	sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

				CARTER
		Get out of the building!

	Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
	choice but to throw it back to Carter.

				LEE
		Roof!

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
	hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
	He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
	are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

				LEE
		Wait!  There's people down there!

				CARTER
		There's people up here!

				LEE
		Get it out of here!

				CARTER
		Take it!

	Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
	and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
	to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
	OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
	off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

				ISABELLA
		Get on your feet.

	Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
	begins to open the package.

				CARTER
		I wouldn't do that!!!

				LEE
		It's a bomb.

	Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
	DOLLAR BILLS.

				ISABELLA
		You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before
		I throw you both in jail for
		obstruction.

				CARTER
		Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you
		right now.

				ISABELLA
		I'm an undercover agent for the United
		States Secret Service.

				CARTER
		How do we know you're not lying?  Let me
		see your badge.

	Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
	her bra.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me see it again?

				LEE
		We can help you.  I'm a detective in
		Hong Kong.

				ISABELLA
		I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

				LEE
		Then you know I'm not walking away from
		this case.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's right.

				ISABELLA
		We need to get out of sight.  Come down
		to my suite.

	INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

				ISABELLA
			(she locks the door)
		Look, I've been working this case for
		months now...

				CARTER
		So what's your story?

				ISABELLA
		They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

	Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
	package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
	food from the mini fridge.

				LEE
		Is this a payoff?

				ISABELLA
		No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard
		of the Superbill?

				CARTER
		It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

				ISABELLA
		It's much more than a counterfeit.  14
		out of 15 world banks can't tell the
		difference.  The paper is Crane linen
		blend -- and the bills are printed on
		U.S. Intaglio presses.

				CARTER
		How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
		to use the presses?

				ISABELLA
		In 1959, the United States was very
		friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We
		wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
		birthday, the government gave him a gift
		-- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The
		only one to ever leave the country. 
		Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
		press on the black market.

				LEE
		Five years ago?!  
			(beat)
		That's right before he left the force.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks.

				ISABELLA
		It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
		this past year.  Then Tan got hold of
		one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
		plates -- and started making superbills.

				LEE
			(understanding)
		And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

				ISABELLA
		Yes.  They've printed and shipped one
		hundred million dollars, and there's
		only one way to spot a fake.

	Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
	RED.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		They use an optical transfer ink from
		India that burns red -- the real ink
		burns black.

				CARTER
		What the hell are they going to do with
		a hundred million dollars in funny
		money?

				ISABELLA
		The real question is, where are the
		plates?  If we can find the plates, we
		can stop the whole operation.

	Isabella thinks for a beat.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Maybe that's where you can help us. 
		Carter, this is your city, right?

	Carter nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

	Lee nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
		plates.
			(hands Lee a card with a phone
			 number)
		Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this
		moment on, you're working for the United
		States Secret Service.

	Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit
	quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on
	Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
	number.

				STERLING (O.S.)
		Sterling.

				ISABELLA
		Lee and Carter are officially out of the
		Secret Service's way...

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
	the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
	Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

				CARTER
		Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my
		calling, Lee. 
		Give me six months and I'll be in
		Washington protecting a white guy.

				LEE
		We both know you would never take a
		bullet for someone else.

				CARTER
		They don't know that.  What are they
		gonna do, try and shoot the President
		during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella
		can pull some strings.  You saw the way
		she was staring at me.

				LEE
		She never even looked at you.

				CARTER
		You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
		me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
		third world ugly.

				LEE
		I am not third world ugly.  Women like
		me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

				CARTER
		Snoopy is about six inches taller than
		you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
		chance.

	Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee
	reluctantly gets in, too.
			
			EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.  

	INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables
	are occupied.

	INT. KITCHEN

	Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
	BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
	worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
	woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half
	Asian kids run around the kitchen.

				CARTER
		Kenny!  How you doin'?

	Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		How's the action tonight?  The house
		making out okay?

	Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

	INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
	big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very
	smokey and very crowded.

				CARTER
			(to Kenny)
		This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
		voice, they all scream and run and shit. 
		Watch.  It's real funny.

	Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

				KENNY
		Come with me.

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

				KENNY
		Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
		Kong, James.

				CARTER
		What??  Where'd you hear that?

				KENNY
		I got my sources.

				CARTER
		And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how
		that works out.
			(beat)
		I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
		place down.

				KENNY
		James, you see my kids back there?  You
		know how much I'm paying for private
		school?  How can you come in here with
		this attitude, you being little Chang's
		godfather?

				CARTER
		Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
		his daddy in jail if you don't
		cooperate.

				KENNY
		Jail!?  James, you better back off. 
		Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

				CARTER
		I'd like to see you try.

	Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
	arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
	countering Kenny's move.

				KENNY
			(to Lee)
		We're on, then.

	Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
	Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

				LEE
			(impressed)
		That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
		did you learn that?

	They switch to Chinese.

				KENNY
		Master Ching taught me.

				LEE
		The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

				KENNY
		No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

	Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing hanging out with Baby
		Duck?

				LEE
		Baby Duck?

				KENNY
		That's what we all used to call him when
		he was a kid -- cause he was always
		quacking.  Never shut up.

				CARTER
		I heard that.

	Lee and Kenny laugh.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, I need some info and I don't have
		time to play around.

				KENNY
		Is this about the funny money?

				CARTER
		How'd you know?

				KENNY
		You've been asking loud questions in all
		the wrong places all morning.  How come
		you always save me for last, James? 
		When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't
		happen I don't know about.

				CARTER
		So tell me what you know.

				KENNY
		I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
		good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
		too, didn't you?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  We already been there.  This is
		big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service
		calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even
		tell the difference.

	Kenny considers this for a moment.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What?

				KENNY
		One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
		dollars at the table here last week.  I
		was about to send my boys down to tune
		his ass up, when the guy comes in and
		pays off the whole thing.  Including the
		vig -- brand new sequential hundred
		dollar bills.  I knew something was
		wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular
		job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
		in cash. 
		But I tested the bills, infrared.  The
		whole thing.  And they checked out. 
		100%.

				LEE
		Do you still have the bills?

				KENNY
		I still have my lunch money from third
		grade.

				CARTER
		Lemme see 'em.

	Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. 
	He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter
	checks it out.

				KENNY
		See.  It's perfect.

	Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		Whoa, what are you doing?

	Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
			(pissed off)
		I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He
		works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

				CARTER
		All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off
		the hook.  For now.

	Carter and Lee move for the door.

				KENNY
		You sure you guys don't want to stay and
		have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu
		shu this side of Compton.

	Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
			
			EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

	Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.

	EXT. REIGN SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee enter.

				CARTER
			(to a worker)
		We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is
		he here?

	Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter
	and Lee exchange looks and run after him.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and
	down some stairs.  Carter and Lee in pursuit.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
	stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

	HU LI

	Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing
	near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER
	in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is
	parked beside it.

	Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of
	the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
	putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink
	without getting mowed down.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
		be remembered for ridding the Triads of
		your petulance.

	Hu Li savors the moment.

				CARTER
		I hope you just said I have no business
		being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

	Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
	freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several
	feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

				ISABELLA
		Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
		want to talk to them first.

	Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee
	falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
	of her gun.

	BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
	the jaw with her fist.

				CARTER
		...oh, that's a filling right there. 
		That's gonna cost you.

	Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

				HU LI
		Put them in the truck.

	The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

				CARTER
		I should kill you right now, but I'm
		gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
		and maybe you can be reformed.

	The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck
		myself.

	As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
	look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
	COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

	The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
	pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

	EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

	The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

	INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

	LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

	They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
	Carter is flexing his battered body.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				CARTER
		What's the first thing I told you --
		never trust nobody.  How could you fall
		for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

				LEE
		She saved our lives.

				CARTER
		For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's
		playing both sides.

	Lee looks disappointed.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a
		thing for her.

				LEE
		Shhh, my head hurts.

				CARTER
		I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"
		me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky
		Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang
		Long are not in South Central.  I didn't
		have to help you.

				LEE
		Why did you help me?

				CARTER
		It doesn't matter.

	Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

				LEE
		I'm not used to having a partner.

				CARTER
		We are not partners.  Between your
		daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just
		took, as far as I can tell all partners
		get you is dead.

				LEE
		Well we're not friends.

				CARTER
		You got that right.  And we ain't
		brothers.  Maybe we should just end this
		right here.

				LEE
		Fine with me.

				CARTER
		I won't talk to you, you don't talk to
		me.  We'll die in peace.

				LEE
		See you in the next world.

	A BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER
		I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I
		won't see you in the next world.

				LEE
		Fine. 

				CARTER
		I believe in heaven.  You people believe
		in heaven?

				LEE
		Yes.  We have heaven.

				CARTER
		Is it the same heaven, or is it a
		Chinese heaven?

				LEE
		What's a Chinese heaven?

				CARTER
		I thought it might be like those five
		foot and under basketball leagues.  They
		don't let everybody in.

				LEE
		I think we should stop talking.

				CARTER
		Fine by me.

	ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You thinking about that girl that dumped
		you?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		If she was the right girl, you'd be
		thinking about her.

				LEE
		Mind your own business.

				CARTER
		How was the sex?

				LEE
		There was no sex.  She was very
		traditional.  We were waiting until we
		were married.

				CARTER
		You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No
		mu-shu?

				LEE
		No mu-shu.

				CARTER
		What about a little king pao chicken?

				LEE
		No kung pao chicken.  Never.

				CARTER
		Steamed dumplings?

				LEE
		Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But
		only when she was drunk.

				CARTER
		That's rough, man.  If I don't get
		steamed dumplings once a week, I go
		crazy.

				LEE
		Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think
		I have a good voice?

				CARTER
		Are you serious?

				LEE
		Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

	Lee turns away from Carter.

				CARTER
		As long as you're asking...I think you
		have a pretty good voice.

				LEE
		I knew it.  What does she know.  You
		want me to sing something?

				CARTER
		That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long
		usually kill their victims?

				LEE
		They'll probably torture us first, shock
		our privates, then put two bullets in
		our eyes and one in the back of the
		head.

				CARTER
		Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

	Lee clears his voice.

				LEE
		Did you happen to see the most beautiful
		girl in the world...and if you did, was
		she crying, crying...hey!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

	The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that
	is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

				HU LI
		Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,
		the dragon's been fed.

	She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best
	to appear completely uninterested.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

	INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

	Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,
	takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
	spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They
	start prying the crate open.

				CARTER
		Very nice.

				LEE
		It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak
		spot.  You ignore everything around you,
		and put all your energy into one perfect
		strike.

				CARTER
		I'll remember that next time I'm
		fighting a box.

	Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about
	$1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hello, Benjamin.

				LEE
		Who's Benjamin?

				CARTER
		Benjamin Franklin, he discovered
		electricity.

				LEE
		A Chinese man discovered electricity.

				CARTER
		No Chinese man discovered electricity.

				LEE
		Yes he did.  He also invented the
		bicycle.

				CARTER
		Now that I believe.

	Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You never know.  Besides, I always
		wanted to die rich.

	The truck lurches.

				LEE
		We're slowing down.  This must be it.

				CARTER
		End of the line.

				LEE
		You've been a good friend, James Carter.

				CARTER
		Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting
		corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass
		from here to Compton.

				LEE
		You could never kick my ass.  You mama's
		boy.

				CARTER
		Don't you talk about my mama.
			(winks at Lee)
		That's more like it.

	EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

	The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's
	approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the
	TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

	Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the
	truck bed is EMPTY.

	Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

	ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

	Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
	bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

	Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
	to the ground.  In the next instant:

	ON LEE

	still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
	onto the roof of the truck.

	ON CARTER

	who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
	use a shield as gunfire erupts.

	Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
	ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
	and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
	the first two guards.

	Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
	CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
	the closest way out:

	A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

	INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the
	underground loading docks.

				LEE
		This way.  I see some lights.

	Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a
	MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that
	lead up to the street.

	EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

	The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.  

	CLOSE ON

	Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
	together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
	VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
	light show in the world.

				LEE
		Vegas...

				CARTER
		Lee.  I just got an idea how someone
		could launder a hundred million dollars
		in cash.

	They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

	A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
	SECONDS.
			
			EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

	FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
	at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
	EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

				LEE
		Red Dragon.

				CARTER
		That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

	Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
	hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the
	rich are making their way inside.

				LEE
		Let's go.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  We can't go in like
		this.  Look at this place, we gotta look
		fly.  We gotta Mac out.

				LEE
		What is Mac out?

				CARTER
		Follow me my Asian brother.

	Carter and Lee start to walk away.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just stay down wind, because I think you
		stepped in some serious rat shit down
		there.

	EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

	INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

				SALESMAN
		May I help you gentlemen?

	Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of
	superbills.

				CARTER
		Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this
		body but pure silk.  And get my partner
		something from the children's
		department.

	Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				SALESMAN
		Would your partner like silk as well?  I
		personally like it when a couple
		matches.

	Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's
		no couple here.  Just two single police
		officers working a very dangerous case.

				LEE
		Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing
		us.

				SALESMAN
		I'm sure all the boys are chasing you
		two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys
		the bell of the ball.

	He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

				CARTER
		This is the last time I go shopping with
		you.

	EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
	tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. 
	Le is awkward in "player" guise.

				CARTER
			(whispering)
		Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You
		own the place.

	Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
	they walk through the doors.

				LEE
		I own the place.

	INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to
	imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT
	BUDDHA --

				CARTER
		That looks exactly like my Uncle
		Darrell.

				LEE
		Buddha is the symbol of luck and good
		fortune.

				CARTER
		Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. 
		The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

	They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA
	COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

	RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The
	MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around
	the perimeter - a sign reads:

				SIGN
		$50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN
	on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

				STEVEN REIGN
		A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
		village in China hired a young Dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  Their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
			(beat)
		Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that
		lost treasure.  It is here, inside the
		greatest casino in the world!  Welcome
		to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a
		winner!

	Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. 
	Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
	waiting.

	A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

	Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on
	the balconies above.

	Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's
	nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down
	the red carpet.

				CARTER
			(to waitress)
		Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...
			(to a cigarette girl)
		Get us a box of your finest cigars.
			(to a change girl)
		Give me ten dollars in nickels.
						
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON

	Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Seven!

	We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

	Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

	GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main
	cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

				CARTER
		Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest
		front in the world.

	As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his
	way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

				LEE
		Carter...here comes the rich white man.

				CARTER
		Wait here.  I'll handle this.

	As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the
	dance floor.

	INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

	The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the
	dance floor lights.

				ISABELLA
		Put your arms around me.

				LEE
		Excuse me?

	Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

				ISABELLA
		Hold me close.  There's cameras
		everywhere.

	An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his
	best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and
	Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her
	face.

				LEE
		What's going on?

				ISABELLA
		I need your help.

				LEE
		Last time you needed my help I ended up
		in the back of a truck.

				ISABELLA
		I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You
		have to trust me.

	Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,
	sensual rhythm.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		You move well.

				LEE
		Just trying to make it look real.

				ISABELLA
		Look over there.  That's the eye in the
		sky room.

	Lee looks over her shoulder. 

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Behind me is the soft count room.  We're
		pretty sure the plates are back there.

				LEE
		Why don't you go get them?

				ISABELLA
		If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

				
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter
	steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

				CARTER
		Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody
		get a picture, we can use it for a mug
		shot.

				STEVEN REIGN
		Detective Carter, you always seem to
		show up where you don't belong.

				CARTER
		Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I
		want the truth.  Is there any way I can
		date your daughter?  Just dinner and a
		movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

				STEVEN REIGN
		Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I
		crawled out from under the first rock. 
		Do you really think you can intimidate
		me here?

				CARTER
		You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most
		counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
		dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure
		genius.

				STEVEN REIGN
		You play games with me, Detective, and
		you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. 
		The odds are always in favor of the
		house.

	Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

	INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

	Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		The Secret Service almost busted Reign
		at his casino in Macao, but the place
		burned down before we could move in.

				LEE
		How do I know I can trust you?

				ISABELLA
		Dip me!

	Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'm asking for real now -- will you help
		the Secret Service?

				LEE
		No.
			(beat)
		But I'll help you.

	Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. 
	He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
	Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

				CARTER
		Lee, what the hell are you doing?

				LEE
		Dancing?

				CARTER
		Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong
		arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the
		line, and you're up here dancing with
		some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

				LEE
		It was Isabella.  She says the plates
		are in the soft count room.

	Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD
	standing in front of a small door.

				CARTER
		Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She
		almost got us killed.  She's setting you
		up again!

				LEE
		No.  I'm going to find out.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  There's guards all over
		the place.  You'll need a distraction.

	Carter looks around the casino.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'll go to the craps table, make a big
		scene.  When security comes over, you
		make your move.  

				LEE
		Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

				CARTER
		I'll give it my best shot.
						
			INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Sir, you're aware that we require a
		fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
		here this weekend?

	Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the
	table.

				CARTER
		I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a
		hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet
		Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,
		people, I came to play.

	The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What the hell is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Those are five hundred dollar chips.

				CARTER
		Did you give me five-hundred dollar
		chips because I'm black?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, I just assumed...

				CARTER
		You assumed a brother coming in here can
		only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
		is that right?  Are you a racist?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, sir.

				CARTER
			(starting to scream)
		Everyone else at the table has thousand
		dollar chips, but the black man gets the
		nickel, is that it?  Did my people
		survive two-hundred years of slavery so
		you could send us back to the cotton
		fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
		Do I look like Chicken George to you?

	The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

				PIT BOSS
		Floor security, we have a problem at
		table nine.

	EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

	The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
	towards Carter's table.

	INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

	TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

				CARTER
		Answer me one question.  How come Ben
		Vereen isn't performing here at the
		hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough
		for you people?

				PIT BOSS
		Lionel Ritchie is performing here
		tonight.

				CARTER
		Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since
		the Commodores.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

	Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way
	into the soft count room.

				CARTER
		I have a dream, where black people and
		white people can gamble together without
		getting different chips!

	A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push
	their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls
	upstairs.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

	Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as
	the Security Guards move in.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you.  Now in the spirit of
		brotherhood, let's play craps!

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
	walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

	He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
	the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
	of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
	trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
	directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
	ceiling.

	WE SEE LEE'S FACE

	as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
	words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

	Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
	of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
	On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
	toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

	Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
	blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
	the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
	Isabella has set him up again.

	He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

				LEE
		Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have
		change for a twenty?

	The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
	down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
	MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
	the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
	right cross.

	Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
	stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
	to Lee's throat.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		Open your mouth.

	She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
	She holds the detonator in her hand.

				HU LI (CONT'D)
			(continuing in Chinese)
		That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. 
		Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
		into your brain.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
	rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner six!

				CARTER
		How much is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Two-hundred thousand!

				CARTER
		Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants
		a hundred dollars?

	Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
	AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Here, your highness, have a hundred
		dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

				GAMBLER
			(South African accent)
		I am not royalty, sir.

				CARTER
		Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My
		great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
		we probably cousins, man.  How much you
		got on the table?

				GAMBLER
		One million.

				CARTER
		Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who
		wants to blow on my hand for luck?

	Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
	YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
		blows on my hand for luck?

				TEXAN
			(embarrassed)
		She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

				CARTER
		Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come
		on, baby, give me some luck.

	The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Nice blowing.  When's your next
		birthday, I'll be the cake.

				TEXAN
		Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

				CARTER
		Don't threaten me.  I got friends in
		this town that will bite off your ears. 
		Just sit tight, because I've got the
		dice and I am on fire!

	Carter throws the dice.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner, seven!

	The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

				CARTER
		Let it ride!
						
			INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
	sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into
	the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
	stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
	casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

	Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
	his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Imagine a business where people hand you
		money.  And you hand them back
		absolutely nothing.

	Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
	Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
	sight of Ricky Tan alive.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Now that's a true American dream. 
		Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
		very greed driven US Customs agent.

	Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You
		know it didn't have to be like this. 
		But it's too bad!  Like father, like
		son.

	Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
	the monitors.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		He's going for the plates.

	Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
	walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
	SUITE.

				RICKY TAN
		Look at this old fool, what does he
		think he's doing?

	Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		It's almost impossible to find a partner
		that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
		you agree, Lee?

	ON ANOTHER SCREEN

	We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
	Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
	Isabella as he goes.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Well, at least you will die with honor. 
		But choy Gien.

	SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

		I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
		That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those
		here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me
		out!

	Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
	Carter's table.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
		cashier.

				CARTER
		That would be great.  Don't want any of
		these rich white people to jump me.

	As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
	glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

	Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Chai Hu Li.
			("Little Fox")
		Have fun.

	Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
	plays with the button.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
		this button.

	Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
	blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
	her gun.

	Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
	his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
	knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		It's time to end this, Inspector.

	Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
	from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
	sticking the gun under her chin.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Don't move!  United States Secret
		Service.

	Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
	hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
	the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

	Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
	rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

	THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

	They're about to move in.

				HU LI
		Get the detonator!

	The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
	KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

	One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
	gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
	back.

	Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

	Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CASHIER

	Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

	CRASH!

	An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
	In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

	The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

				CARTER
		Lee!!

	The guards restrain him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lemme ask you something.  Any of you
		ever felt $500,000 before?

	He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
	as the GUARDS hit the floor.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Doesn't feel so good, does it?

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it
	from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES
	OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
	DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
	Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
	detonator on her rounds.

	Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
	BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
	but he does see:

	ACROSS THE CASINO

	Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
	bay with a croupier stick.

				CARTER
		Black man gets on a hot streak and
		you're all trippin'?

	Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same
	simultaneous though:

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(help!)
		Lee!

				LEE
			(help!)
		MMMMMM!!!!

	Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
	But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
	is the HIGH WAY.

	Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
	Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
	He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
	landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
	side.

	Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
	the Sky Room.  He grins.

				CARTER
		Check it out.  Catfight!

	POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the
	floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other
	to get to it first.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
	arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
	plea MUFFLED.

				CARTER
		What the HELL are you doing with tape on
		your face?

	No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
	and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
	and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
	between swings.  Suddenly:

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

	Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
	as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the
	EXITS.

	THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
	on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		This can't be good.

	Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
	high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
	it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

	WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
	the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

	ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
	STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

	The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
	up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
	Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

	Hu Li lifts the detonator.

	Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

	Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

				LEE
			(diving on Carter)
		Bomb!!!

	Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

	KABOOM!

	The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash
	volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. 
	SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

	AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

	Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines. 
	The place is deserted.

				CARTER
		Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
		your mouth?

				LEE
		I did!

				CARTER
		No you didn't!

				LEE
		Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

	A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
			
						LEE (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is alive.

				CARTER
		What?!?!

				LEE
		We have to get to the Penthouse.

	Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
	of the casino.

				CARTER
		Hold on!

	Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
	But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see
	what is holding him up.  

	Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You go after Ricky.  I got this.

				LEE
		Carter...

				CARTER
		Just GO!

	Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE
	TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
	short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

	DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

	Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her
	long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,
	flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'm not gonna hold you back this time
		just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna
		pretend you're a man.

	She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
	undershirt.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		A very beautiful man with a perfect body
		who I'd like to take to the movies.

	She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
	like a master.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I may have been absent the day we went
		over this in karate class.

	Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
	soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for
	another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

	INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

	Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND
	cuts through, parting the doors.

	It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				ISABELLA
		I'm fine.

	She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and
	holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

				LEE
		I didn't know which side you were on.

				ISABELLA
		Now you know.

	DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
	- the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and
	steps into the elevator.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

	The elevator doors close.
			
	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
	HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
	black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
	comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

				RICKY TAN
		American's love to gamble.  Don't they,
		Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
		leaving.

				RICKY TAN
		And my plates?

				STEVEN REIGN
		They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
		have a problem with that.

	Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
	starts to walk toward the door.

				RICKY TAN
		I enjoyed that little story you told
		about the Dragon and the treasure.  My
		mother used to tell it to me all the
		time.  Do you know the moral of that
		story, Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		Greed will imprison us all.

	Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

				RICKY TAN
		I hate that fortune cookie shit.

	Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
	dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.

	Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
	Carter's hands.

				CARTER
		Will you STOP?!?!
			(picks up cocktail umbrella)
		What am I supposed to fight you with?

	No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
	WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
	got nowhere to hide.

	She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
	against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
	kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

	THWACK!

	The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
	she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
	at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

	Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
	HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		When are you people gonna learn?  Don't
		mess with the brothas!

	WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
	reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
	covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Benjamin!

	Carter runs for the elevator.
						
				INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
	body.

				RICKY TAN
		You're just like your father, Lee.  All
		these years hiding behind his badge.  I
		wanted to help him, to share with him,
		but he was too afraid of change.  When
		you think about it, I didn't really kill
		him.  I just put him out of his misery.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.  It's over.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think it's over.  There are
		casinos all over this country.  Let me
		make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
		the same mistake he did.

	Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

				LEE
		If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
		kill you.

				RICKY TAN
		Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

	Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
	taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
	Carter bursts in the room.

				CARTER
		Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
		up, Lee?

	Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
	like this before.

				RICKY TAN
		Would you like me to tell you how your
		father died?

				CARTER
		Lee, you okay?

	Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

				RICKY TAN
		He never begged for his life.  Or tried
		to make a deal.  All that he asked me,
		just seconds before I pulled the
		trigger, was that I promise not to kill
		you.

	Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
	trigger but can't.

				CARTER
		Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
		man.  He's making you do this.

				LEE
		It's worth it to me.

				RICKY TAN
		Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
		gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
		like your father?

				CARTER
		C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
		won, now just put the gun down.

	Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

				RICKY TAN
		That's what I thought.

	Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
	plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

	THE GUN IS LOOSE

	Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

	Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
	SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

	Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
	grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

	But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof. 
	SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
	WINNER!"

	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
	it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		I don't know about you, but I need a
		wine cooler.

	As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
	bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
	This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		We'll go together, Inspector.

				CARTER
		Please tell me she just asked for a ride
		to the airport.

	Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
	and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
	PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

	The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
	of the hotel.

	THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

	Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
	They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
	SIGN.

	It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

	Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
	TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
	The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

				LEE
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit!!

	They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
	and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
	STRETCH LIMO.
						
	INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
	try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
	when they realize they're alive!

				CARTER
		We made it, man.

				LEE
		No problem.

	Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
	OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
	them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
	night on the town.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		Well, there is a God after all.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
	the hotel.

				LIMO DRIVER
		Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

	In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
	CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		We're all going gambling and then to see
		Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are
		feeling lucky!

	INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

	Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
	Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
	Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
	Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

				CARTER
		I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
		You played it cool, though.  Walking
		away, never looking back.

				LEE
		She's going home to New York.  I need
		some ice.

	Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

				CARTER
		That your gate down there?

				LEE
		Yes.

				CARTER
		I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

				LEE
		I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

				CARTER
		You take care of yourself, Lee.

	Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
	like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

				LEE
		Carter, wait.  There's something I want
		you to have.

	Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

				CARTER
		Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I
		can't take this.

				LEE
		It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

	Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

				CARTER
		In that case, I got something for you. 
		I picked it up at the hotel.

	Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

				LEE
		What is this?

				CARTER
		About fifty grand.  I won it at the
		tables.

				LEE
		No, Carter.  I can't take this.

				CARTER
		It's okay, I got lots more.

	Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		They owe us, man.  That's the least they
		can do.

				LEE
		This money is evidence.

				CARTER
		Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
		minutes and live it up.  There must be
		something you want.

	Lee looks back toward Isabella.

				LEE
		I always wanted to go to Madison Square
		Garden.  See the Knicks play.

				CARTER
		New York City?

				LEE
		First class.

				CARTER
		The Plaza Hotel?

				LEE
		A little Mu-shu.

				CARTER
		Some Kung-Pao?

	They look at each other, smile.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I could use a little vacation.

				LEE
		Amen to that, brother.

	As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
	SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
	a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
	their way through the airport.

RUSH HOUR 2

	EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

	A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
	watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
	a half million people a day.

	EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

	THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

	HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
	VENDOR across the street.

	She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:

	THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

	TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
	a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
	street vendor.

				HU LI
			(Chinese, subtitled)
		Someone better call the police.

	EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
	a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
	dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
	look to two girls in a convertible.

				CARTER
			(int Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

	The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
	is driving and singing to his radio.

				LEE
			(singing)
		...wish they all could be California...
		wish they all could be California
		girls...

	Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
	out of the SUNROOF.

				CARTER
		I warned you about playing that shit
		when I'm in the car.

				LEE
		That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
		Chinese man's CD.

				CARTER
		Did you see the way those girls drove
		off?  I did you a favor.

				LEE
		Those girls drove off because of you.

				CARTER
		All I did was invite them for a drink.

				LEE
		You invited them to get naked and
		sacrifice a small goat.

				CARTER
			(checking Chinese-English
			 dictionary)
		I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

	Lee picks up his CD case.

				LEE
		You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
		Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

				CARTER
		Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
		been here three days and we haven't done
		shit.  We haven't been to a club,
		haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on
		vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

				LEE
		Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

				CARTER
		Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some
		women.  Now stop playing dumb and show
		me the shu!

	Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over
	LEE'S CELL PHONE.

	INTERCUT

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, there was a bombing at the American
		Embassy.  Two American translators were
		killed.

				LEE
		Any leads?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(beat)
		We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
		want to take the case, I'll understand.

				LEE
		It's my responsibility.

	Lee hangs up the cell phone.

				CARTER
		What was that?  Did you just pick up a
		case?  Did we just take another damn
		case on my vacation?

	Lee smiles at Carter.

				LEE
		Of course not.  My Superindendent
		invited us to a club tonight.  Big
		party.

				CARTER
		Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will
		kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard
		you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

				LEE
		Carter, would I lie to you?
						
			EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
	way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
	hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
	when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

				CARTER
		That's what I'm talking about.  A real
		Hong Kong night club.  You want an
		Altoid?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		You better take one.  Your breath has
		been a little funky all day.  Let me
		look at you.

	Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just relax and don't worry about a
		thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You
		got condoms?

				LEE
		No.  

				CARTER
		Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
		it in half.

	Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
	GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
	to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
	a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
	Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

				LEE
		I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		They don't like tourists in here, so try
		to blend in.

				CARTER
		Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than
		everyone here.  Where you going?

				LEE
		Bathroom.

	Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

				CARTER
		How you boys doing tonight?

	The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	OLD MAN continues to sing.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That is the worst singing I've ever
		heard.  That sounds like something you'd
		hear in prison after lights out.

	The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
	door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
	MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

				CARTER (V.O.)
		Get closer to my body now.  And just
		love me, till you don't know how...

	Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
	realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
	YOU GET ENOUGH."

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
	watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
	Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
	few of the smitten women who are watching him.

				LEE
			(whispering from side of stage)
		Carter, get off that stage!

				CARTER
		Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
		star, Lee.  A god to these people!

	Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
	the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

				LEE
		This is a gangster bar, we're here
		undercover.

				CARTER
		I knew you were lying.

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		Damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
		I'm just starting to have fun.
			(beat)
		Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
		badge and do your thing.

				LEE
		No, we're here for information, to find
		out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
		must tread softly and keep our ears
		open.

				CARTER
		Tread softly?  Who taught you how to
		roost a bar?

				LEE
		Carter, you don't understand.  These men
		are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
		most deadly gang in China.

				CARTER
		Man, are you crazy?  You think that
		scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
		gangs.  We were having gang wars before
		anybody even thought about it.  We get
		royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
		your badge and gun and I'll show you how
		it's done.

				LEE
		No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
		Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

				CARTER
		You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
		last night.

	Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
	Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
		lui.

	Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
	Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(whispering)
		What'd I say?

				LEE
		You just said you're their worst
		nightmare - and to line their mothers up
		for a milking.

				CARTER
		Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
		out.

	Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
	as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let's try this again.  Who here knows
		Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Now I know you're lying.  

	The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
	spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(as they run out)
		I come back and catch y'all singing
		Michael Jackson and you're all going to
		jail.

	EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
	and several gangsters round a corner.

				CARTER
		Stop!  LAPD!

	Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
	GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
	under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
	Their only way out is UP.

	Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
	them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
	VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

				CARTER
		Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

	Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
	CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
	LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
	pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

	BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
	to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

	WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
	CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Forget this...

	He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
	come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
	after the GANGSTER LEADER.

	ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

	Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
	the hill.

	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

	Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
	WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
	OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

	HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

	As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
	OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

				CARTER
			(out of breath)
		Freeze!  Nobody move!

	Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
	Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

	She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
	ROOF!

	He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
	the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

	LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

	They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
	Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
	She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

	CARTER AND LEE

	holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
	to bend.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

				LEE
		Try to land on your feet.

	Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

				CARTER
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit.

	The POLE BREAKS
			
	SUPER THE TITLE:

	RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

	INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

	Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in
	silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

				CARTER
		You lied to me. 

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		You're sorry.  I got somebody's old
		chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
		tell me you're sorry.  Just take me
		home.

				LEE
		No time.  There was an explosion at the
		American Embassy today -- two American
		translators were killed.

	Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

				CARTER
		So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
		up the Embassy?

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

	Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
	year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

	MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

				CARTER
		I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
		this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -
		let one of them be your partner.

				LEE
		This won't take long. 

	Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

				MASTER FU
		Dragon kick!

	Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Lotus block!

	The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu
	notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Twisting Tiger!

	No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
			(staring straight at Lee)
		Twisting Tiger!

	Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
	that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in
	the glow...

	...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Didn't I teach you to always arch your
		back?

				LEE
			(bowing, humbled)
		Yes, Master.

	While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
	YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

				CARTER
		I was watching you kids.  My name is
		Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
		black belt.  At least that's what I tell
		the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
		where I work out.

	Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
	reaction.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me give you kids some tips.  The key
		to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why
		don't you stand up.

	THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw
	punches.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show
		you how to block.  Come on, stand up,
		give me your best shot -- try to kick
		right to my head.

	The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
	HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
	to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of
	the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That's pretty good.  Which one of you
		kids did that?

	INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Master Fu walking.

				LEE
		I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a
		man who used to train with you.  He's
		become a killer - the worst kind of
		animal.

				MASTER FU
		Animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
		The man you seek is lower than a
		serpent.  
			(faces Lee)
		...he kills for money.

	In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
	disappear O.S.

	Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
	thought.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		He was the best I ever trained, you
		know.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan?

				MASTER FU
		No.  Your father.
			(Lee reacts)
		Your father and Ricky Tan were my
		favorite students... and for such awful
		things to happen as they did --

	Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
	uncomfortable.

				LEE
		How do I find Ricky Tan?

	AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by
	in the other direction, disappear O.S.

	Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

				MASTER FU
		A seeding spends its entire life
		reaching towards Heaven.

				LEE
		I know, Master, but...

				MASTER FU
		The answers you seek can be found in
		Heaven on Earth.

				LEE
		Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't
		understand.
			(working it)
		A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A
		mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

				MASTER FU
		It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven
		on Earth."  You will find your answers
		there.

	Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
	pathway.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

	Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
	Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Cheap bastard...

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
	students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
	locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
	hands, and sitting on the last one.

				CARTER
		And that's how you use the LAPD choke
		hold.  Now start practicing and don't
		make me come back here!

				LEE
		Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

				LEE
		Just follow my lead and act like a
		tourist.

				CARTER
		I am a tourist.

	INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand
	in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 

				HOSTESS
		Good afternoon, gentlemen.

	Lee bows, followed by Carter.

				LEE
			(in Chinese)
		Hello.

				CARTER
		How you doin'?

				LEE
		My friend is on vacation, from America. 
		I want to show him a good time.

				HOSTESS
		Oh, you American?

				CARTER
		That's right.

				HOSTESS
		You bring American money?

				CARTER
			(holding up a Platinum AmEx)
		Never leave home without it.
			(to Lee)
		Lee, this one's on me.  You save your
		money.

	The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN
	SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL
	WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

				HOSTESS
		You get massage from Chinese girl
		before?

				CARTER
		No.  It's my first time.

				HOSTESS
		You pick any girl for you and your
		friend.

	Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

				CARTER
		Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that
		one.

				HOSTESS
		Oh yes, she's very nice.

				CARTER
		She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm
		gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take
		that one, too.  How you doin', baby? 
		And...that one in pink.  She can do my
		feet.

	Lee elbows Carter.

				LEE
		What are you doing?

				CARTER
		She said I could pick any girl I want.

				LEE
		Well, hurry up.

				CARTER
		Hey!  You don't break in front of a
		black man in a buffet line.

				HOSTESS
			(to Lee)
		Your friend have big appetite.
			(handing ROBES to Lee and
			 Carter)
		Please put these on and wait upstairs in
		the quiet room.

	INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women
	massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's
	showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
	background. 

	Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
	PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
	TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

				CARTER
		Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come
		through, Lee.

	LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
	SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of
	sophistication and brutality.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				LEE
		Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

				CARTER
		That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. 
		I'll go over with you right now, shake
		him down.

				LEE
		This is a very dangerous man.

				CARTER
		I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna
		ruin my massage because of some midget
		in a house coat.

				LEE
		I'm calling for back up!

	Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

	Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
	with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a
	decision, gets up and walks towards him.

				CARTER
		Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
		for you.  Get up.

	Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

				RICKY TAN
		I'm busy at the moment.

				CARTER
		I said get on your feet!

				RICKY TAN
		I know you, Detective Carter, right? 
		You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying
		your visit?

				CARTER
		I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
		and don't let the robe fool you.  This
		is the only color they had left.  Now
		get up!

	Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
	from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
	against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
	around the room waiting to move.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I told you to get on your feet!

	Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
	breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

				RICKY TAN
		Lee, I've missed you, brother.
			(getting up, giving Lee a hug)
		I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
		sorry, you must be under great pressure.

				LEE
		You must come with me for questioning.

				CARTER
		Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken
		and hot oil waiting for me.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think so...

	A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
	towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
	Lee and Carter.  A beat...

				CARTER
		I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

				RICKY TAN
		It's no problem.  But I must excuse
		myself, inspector.

				CARTER
		That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

	Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

				RICKY TAN
		Congratulations.  And good day.

	As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
	But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

	Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
	covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

				CARTER
			(ref: his privates)
		Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

	Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
	Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
	throwing him out the front door.

	Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
	their shoulders.

	EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

	Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies
	open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway. 
	Both men are completely naked.

	EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

	A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
	people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
	behind.

				CARTER
		Goddamn you got a small ass.

				LEE
		Don't look at my ass!

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

	PANDEMONIUM

	The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET
	SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
	bullpen.

	SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
	50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Chin, you have been ordered by the
		Ministry of Public Security to assist
		the FBI and Secret Service with our
		investigation, to provide us with
		whatever we need.  If you have
		information, it belongs to us.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		This is still Hong Kong.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Two Americans have been killed on United
		States Government property -- this is
		our investigation.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
		people...

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		No.  He will report to me.  Do we
		understand each other?

	SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. 
	Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
	can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
		Who the hell is that?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(humiliated)
		That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The
		detective in charge of our
		investigation.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to
		talk to the great Inspector Lee.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting
	on a suit and fixing his tie. 
	Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
	Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

				LEE
		Where are you going?

				CARTER
		Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn
		passport back.  I'm going home.

				LEE
		Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

				CARTER
		Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,
		so I backed you up.  I was about to take
		out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

				LEE
		Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

				CARTER
		My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes
		to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
		I'm not the one who goes to massage
		parlors to bust crime lords!

				LEE
		It's my job!

				CARTER
		You're pathetic, man.  When's the last
		time you had some fun?  When's the last
		time you took a night off, had a date?

				LEE
		I have plenty of dates.

				CARTER
		Really?  When's the last time you had
		some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when
		was it?  Year of the rat?

				LEE
		You would never understand my life. 
		You're not Chinese.

				CARTER
		And you ain't black!

	The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly
	walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half
	dressed.

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin
	stands in the back.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
		the United States Secret Service.

				LEE
		The Secret Service?  Why?

				STERLING
		What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
		this room.  The men who were killed
		yesterday were not American translators. 
		They were undercover U.S. customs agents
		trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. 
		We don't know what they're transporting
		out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
		got the agents killed.

				LEE
		How can we help?

				STERLING
		Stay the hell out of our way.

				LEE
		I can get to Ricky Tan.

				STERLING
		We know all about Tan.  That's why we're
		leaving him out there as bait.  We think
		this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
		and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks
	he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

				CARTER
		Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. 
		I'm on a car phone!

	INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong
		Kong right now?

				CARTER
		Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm
		in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and
		Vine, two minutes from the station.  How
		about I pick you up right now and take
		you to dinner?

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		It's nine-thirty in the morning.

				CARTER
		Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. 
		Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Do you know what happened yesterday,
		Carter?  I was officially nominated for
		the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. 
		There was a dinner last night, two
		hundred LAPD officers were there.

				CARTER
		Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez
		there?  He owes me money.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		I've waited my whole life for this job,
		but I don't have a shot in hell of
		getting it.  Do you know why?

				CARTER
		Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You
		tell them there's no crime in being
		lonely.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is
		because the entire department is about
		to find out the stolen credit cards we
		impounded were used to buy two first
		class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what
		the hell is Heaven on Earth?

				CARTER
		Sir, I'm working on a big case over here
		-- and by the time I get back they're
		gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you
		there?  Hello?  Shit!

	As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is
	standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY
	PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
	outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
	tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
	LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

				CARTER
		How you doing?  Can you direct me to the
		Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  

	The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
	filled with birds.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my
		birds dead and deep fried.  You ever
		been to Popeyes?

	The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. 
		I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
		just put the blade down and let the bird
		go.

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own
	office - but never gets there.

	AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. 
	Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
	head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his
	destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

	STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around
	Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the
	crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back
	by the heat.

				LEE
		Carter!  CARTER!

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

	Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
	BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
	store.

				CARTER
		How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven
		on Earth.

	The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

		Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

	As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

	Pause.

	Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
	if it's worth staying...

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

	Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin
	approaches.

				LEE
		All he wanted was some mu-shu.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Are you okay, Lee?

	Beat.

				LEE
		I'm sorry, I have to go.

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

	Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
	for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks
	to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
	waiting Daimler.

	The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the
	street with a determined look on his face.

				CARTER
		I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

	Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

	INT. TAXI - EVENING

	The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

				CARTER
			(loud)
		Follow that limo.

	The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You understand what I'm saying?  Follow
		that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This
		is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
			(beat)
		We are still parked -- we're not moving! 
		This is the opposite of chasing -- drive
		the car or I will kill you!

	The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes
	in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

				CAB DRIVER
		Now you speak my language.
			
	INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

	Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. 
	Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in
	tribute to Carter.

	His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

	INTERCUT -- 

	INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, we just got a call from the harbor
		patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little
		party on his boat tonight.  Victoria
		harbor.  If you don't want to...

				LEE
		Did you tell Sterling?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Let him find out on his own.  I want the
		Hong Kong police handling this.

				LEE
		Thank you.

	Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC
	up, a man on a mission.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

	A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan
	walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
	crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

	Carter steps out of the cab.

				CARTER
		Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You
		understand?

				CAB DRIVER
		Yes.  I understand.

	Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
	leaving him alone on the docks.

	Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
	parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
	names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
	politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

	CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN
	HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

				DOORMAN #1
		Invitation, please.

				CARTER
		I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

				DOORMAN #1
		The band has been playing over an hour.

				CARTER
		I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. 
		Ricky here yet, I need to get his
		requests.

	As Carter walks past the doorman -- 

				DOORMAN #1
		Wait.

				CARTER
		Last party all he wanted was Sting --
		not one person danced.  Tonight I'm
		doing Superfreak, I don't care what he
		says.  Where is he?

				DOORMAN #1
		Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the
		help.

	Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

				CARTER
		Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the
		star.  That's my band up there -- I
		control the mood, the groove, the
		atmosphere.

	Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Can you do that?
			(man shakes head "no")
		That's why you're down here and I'm up
		there.  Now this is my party -- don't
		forget it!

	Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

	The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. 
	Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
	the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
	but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
	side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
	clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
	LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

	EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

	As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
	from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
	- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
	REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
	impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
	money. 
	He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
	Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
	as sociopath.

	Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
	hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
	for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

	Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
	stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
	champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

				CARTER
		How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince
		Mubutu from Nigeria.

				ISABELLA
		Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That
		seat is taken.

				CARTER
			(in mangled Spanish)
		San Juan!  You must know my good friend
		Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
		Elizondo.

				ISABELLA
			(in English)
		I don't think so.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
		in the best circles.  But hey, I
		understand.  Make yourself at home,
		Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever
		you want.  My ship is your ship.

				ISABELLA
		This is your ship?

				CARTER
		That's right.  I'm the owner, the
		Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

				ISABELLA
		El Capitan?

				CARTER
		I don't want to play games with you,
		Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself
		with you -- in one of those bathrooms
		over there in about five minutes.

				ISABELLA
		Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a
		beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

				CARTER
		Called?  What's my ship called?
			(he has no idea)
		Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
		Johnson.

				ISABELLA
		The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name
		on the back was "Red Dragon."

				CARTER
		Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

				ISABELLA
		I'm sure, because this is my friend's
		yacht.  And it's his party.

				CARTER
		Your friend's ship?
			(looking around)
		Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the
		wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason
		my keys didn't work.

				STEVEN REIGN
			(taking seat next to Isabella)
		Who's your friend?

				ISABELLA
		Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? 
		You're big time.  You own all them big
		hotels.  What are you doing in Hong
		Kong?

				STEVEN REIGN
			(ushering away Isabella)
		I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
		in the sights.

				ISABELLA
		Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

	Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. 
	Carter's watching.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a
	BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the
	throat, pushing him against the wall.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

				BODYGUARD #1
		Who's asking?

				LEE
		The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a
		detective today and he's not getting
		away with it.  Now where is he?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or
		we'll kick your lying ass!

	Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing
	right behind him.

				LEE
		Carter?

				CARTER
		Who died?

				LEE
		You.

				CARTER
		Detective Yu?  Never met him.

				LEE
		Not Yu.  You!

				CARTER
		Who?

				LEE
		Do you understand the words that are
		coming out of my mouth?

				CARTER
		Nobody understands the words that are
		coming out of your mouth.

				BODYGUARD #1
		Get your hands in the air.

	Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front
	of them with GUNS in hand.

				BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is expecting you.
			
			INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED
	and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen
	satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door
	and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

				RICKY TAN
		Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
		You can do it, big guy.

	ON TV

	We see Shaq miss his free throw.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. 
		I just lost five grand.

	Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Why don't we go on the deck, get some
		air...and some privacy.
			(to Hu Li)
		Leave us alone.

	Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Could you have your partner wait for us
		outside?

				CARTER
		I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I
		got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

				LEE
			(to Carter)
		I'll meet you on the main deck in ten
		minutes.

	Carter pulls Lee aside.

				CARTER
		What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

				LEE
		I'm okay, you go.

				CARTER
		Why the hell should you believe him?  He
		had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty
		shit.

				LEE
		Remember I told you my father was a
		policeman?
			(beat)
		Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		What the hell is going on here?

	No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns
	and walks the other way.

	EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

	Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

				RICKY TAN
		Despite what people suspect...what you
		suspect --

				LEE
		Don't.

	Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

				RICKY TAN
		... if your father were alive, I would
		be turning to him now.
			(beat)
		I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
		but I believe some of my people did.  My
		enemies are trying to frame me.
			(beat)
		There is a war going on within the
		Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My
		name has been written into the book of
		death.

				LEE
		The police can protect you.

				RICKY TAN
		Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal
		with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get
		me out of Hong Kong.

				LEE
		Tell me why they killed the customs
		agents.

				RICKY TAN
		There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
		Harbor...

	Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

	Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
	screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
	falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

	Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
	attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
	off the bodyguards.

	INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck
	above.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
	suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

	It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
	Hu Li with his leg.

				CARTER
		All right, get your hands up.

	Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
	one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
	Bodyguard #2.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Hu Li face off.

				CARTER
		You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give
		you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

	Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

	INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches
	his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

				LEE
		Hu Li!

	Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT
	starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the
	moving boat.

	Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the
	stern.
			
	EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
	watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

	Carter turns his head, sees --

	-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
	escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
	during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears
	back into the shadows.

	EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

	The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. 
	Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

	Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was
		our only bait, and now he's gone.  You
		finally got your revenge - at the
		expense of a U.S. Government
		investigation.

				CARTER
		What "revenge" is he talking about?

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
		you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
		a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
		off this case.  I don't ever want to see
		you again, you got that?

				CARTER
		Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
		you --

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going
		back to L.A.

				CARTER
		Fine with me.

	Sterling walks away disgusted.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
		fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

	Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin
	motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
	approach.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
			(to police officers)
		Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

				LEE
		I'll take him.

				CARTER
		Hell no.

	The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to
		you.

	Carter stalks off.

				LEE
		Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood
		for your bullshit.

	Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're
	about to come to blows.

				CARTER
		What are you gonna do about it,
		grasshopper?

				LEE
		I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

				CARTER
		Give me your best shot, you flat assed
		mama's boy.

				LEE
		Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my
		ass!

				CARTER
		I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

				LEE
		No.  She's a school teacher.

				CARTER
		You're not very good at this, are you?

				LEE
		Good at what?   

				CARTER
		Forget it.

	A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

				LEE
		Five years ago, my father was Chief
		Inspector working a big international
		smuggling case.

				CARTER
		Ask me if I give a shit.

	Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan killed my father.

	Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		He found out his partner, Tan, had been
		working for the Triads all along.
			(beat)
		Before my father could prove it, he was
		killed in the line of duty.

				CARTER
		How the hell did Tan get away with it?

				LEE
		All the evidence against him
		disappeared, the smuggling case was
		unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to
		the Triads openly.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,
		Lee, you know my father died on the job. 
		You could have told me...
			(realizing)
		This is about more than all that, isn't
		it?  This is about your Daddy's last
		case, right?

	Lee's caught, fibs badly.

				LEE
		No, no, that would be crazy --

				CARTER
		You thought the "Customs Agents get
		blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
		Tan" and you put it all together and
		came up with a five year old case. 
		That's why you didn't tell me what we
		were doing...

				LEE
		I thought you'd think it was crazy.

				CARTER
		IT IS CRAZY!

				LEE
		I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

	Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
	car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and
	yells.

				CARTER
		So are you getting on the plane or not?!

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		Come on, we still got time to order the
		Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher
		meal, they bring it first.

				LEE
		I cannot go to LA...

	Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
	cop beneath the attitude.

				CARTER
		It sounds impossible --

				LEE
		You said --

				CARTER
		-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
		square up my father's death, I'd go to
		hell to do it.

	Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You want to figure out why they killed
		your Daddy, get on the plane.

				LEE
		Why LA?

				CARTER
			(still not turning)
		I guess you're going to have to trust me
		on this one.
			
			INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

	Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
	passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of
	doubt.

				LEE
		I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a
		boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

				CARTER
		Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
		Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
		the Rich White Man.

				LEE
		Follow the Rich White Man?

				CARTER
		Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
		White Man" all run together like it's
		one word.

				LEE
		Follow the RichWhiteMan...

				CARTER
		Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,
		has a rich white man taking his cut. 
		Every single one.  Now in our case, we
		know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

				LEE
		Who?

				CARTER
		Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky
		Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
		before Ricky got smoked.

				LEE
		How do you know he's our man?

				CARTER
		Because when the shooting started he was
		way too cool.  See most white people,
		when there's shooting, they either hide
		in a toilet or start screaming high
		pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

				LEE
		You sound like that all the time.

				CARTER
		Black people keep their cool when the
		shit goes down.

				LEE
		Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never
		panic.

				CARTER
		Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
		coming?  You people were screaming your
		asses off.

				LEE
		Just tell me where I can find this
		Steven Reign.

				CARTER
		The same place you find all
		RichWhiteMen.
			(a tray arrives)
		Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love
		this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

	CUT TO REVEAL --

	Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

	Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

	INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

	Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
	hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

	Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the
	penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven
	Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the
	door.

	Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
		Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
		his suite at his hotel, I told you this
		would work out.  They still just
		talking?

				LEE
		He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

				CARTER
		He'll be back soon.

				LEE
		How do you know?

				CARTER
		Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,
		I'll take over.

	Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
	sleep on the bed.

				LEE
		Carter, there's something I have to tell
		you.  You were right about what you said
		in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never
		take a day off.  It's all I have right
		now.

				CARTER
		Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

				LEE
		The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
		in six months.

				CARTER
		You pull a muscle or something?

				LEE
		My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
		month before our wedding.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

				LEE
		It's a long story.

				CARTER
		Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
		cop thing -- never knowing if you were
		dead or alive.  I've seen it a million
		times.

				LEE
		No.  It was my singing.

				CARTER
		Excuse me?

				LEE
		She hated my voice.  Said it drove her
		crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in
		bed - in the shower - I thought she
		liked it.  She finally told me it was
		driving her crazy.

	Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

				CARTER
		Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
		our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

	LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's she doing?

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

	She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
	CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee?  You okay?

	Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
	unbutton her blouse.

				LEE
		She's just standing around -- not doing
		much.

				CARTER
		Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later
		something's gonna happen.

				LEE
		I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

	Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat
	as he watches her undress.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Slow down, baby.

				CARTER
		What did you say?

				LEE
		Nothing.  I said nothing.

	Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Is it hot in here?

				CARTER
		Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

				LEE
		I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
		bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

				CARTER
		What's going on?  

	Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

				LEE
		She's getting undressed.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars.

				LEE
		No.  It's not right.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
		you.

	Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
	Carter watches to the window.

				LEE
		What's she doing?

				CARTER
		Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

				LEE
		I don't want to hear this.

				CARTER
		Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra
		and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring
		Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
		there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
		looks like Snoopy.

				LEE
		Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

				CARTER
		She just took her hair down.  Now she's
		going for the bra -- the clasp is in
		front -- she's using both hands.
			(to Lee)
		You better get that ice.

	Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

				LEE
		That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing
		this!

	Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
	living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in
	bra and panties.

				CARTER
		This is our job.  We took an oath as
		police officers.  If we don't do this,
		who will?  Firemen?

	Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees
	Isabella hang up the phone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Wait a sec - what the hell is that
		between her legs?

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		She's reaching into her panties --
		something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,
		God...please don't let it be a dick.

				LEE
		What is it?

				CARTER
		No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
		microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

	CLOSE ON ISABELLA

	As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She
	puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
	and puts on a robe.

				LEE
		I don't understand?

				CARTER
		She's walking back towards the door.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
	hotel room talking with someone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		She opened the door.  Someone is
		delivering a package.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
		package to your office.  It's a bomb!

	Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
	she walks into the bedroom --

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
	entrance of the hotel.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running
	down the hallway.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it
	up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING
	THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

				LEE/CARTER
		NO!

	Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
	panties.

				CARTER
		Damn girl, you fine.

	Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the
	BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
	toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
	floor.

	Nothing happens.

	Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
	CART, about to walk right past the package --

				LEE
		GET DOWN!!

	Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

				CARTER
		Pick it up!

				LEE
		It's your turn!

				CARTER
		I don't need a turn!

	Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
	heading for the elevator.

				LEE
		Throw it!

	Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
	STANDING INSIDE.

				HOTEL GUESTS
		Do you want us to hold the elevator?

				CARTER
		Get the hell away from here!

	Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
	with it --

				LEE
		Stairs!

	Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
	sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

				CARTER
		Get out of the building!

	Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
	choice but to throw it back to Carter.

				LEE
		Roof!

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
	hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
	He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
	are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

				LEE
		Wait!  There's people down there!

				CARTER
		There's people up here!

				LEE
		Get it out of here!

				CARTER
		Take it!

	Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
	and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
	to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
	OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
	off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

				ISABELLA
		Get on your feet.

	Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
	begins to open the package.

				CARTER
		I wouldn't do that!!!

				LEE
		It's a bomb.

	Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
	DOLLAR BILLS.

				ISABELLA
		You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before
		I throw you both in jail for
		obstruction.

				CARTER
		Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you
		right now.

				ISABELLA
		I'm an undercover agent for the United
		States Secret Service.

				CARTER
		How do we know you're not lying?  Let me
		see your badge.

	Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
	her bra.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me see it again?

				LEE
		We can help you.  I'm a detective in
		Hong Kong.

				ISABELLA
		I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

				LEE
		Then you know I'm not walking away from
		this case.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's right.

				ISABELLA
		We need to get out of sight.  Come down
		to my suite.

	INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

				ISABELLA
			(she locks the door)
		Look, I've been working this case for
		months now...

				CARTER
		So what's your story?

				ISABELLA
		They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

	Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
	package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
	food from the mini fridge.

				LEE
		Is this a payoff?

				ISABELLA
		No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard
		of the Superbill?

				CARTER
		It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

				ISABELLA
		It's much more than a counterfeit.  14
		out of 15 world banks can't tell the
		difference.  The paper is Crane linen
		blend -- and the bills are printed on
		U.S. Intaglio presses.

				CARTER
		How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
		to use the presses?

				ISABELLA
		In 1959, the United States was very
		friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We
		wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
		birthday, the government gave him a gift
		-- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The
		only one to ever leave the country. 
		Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
		press on the black market.

				LEE
		Five years ago?!  
			(beat)
		That's right before he left the force.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks.

				ISABELLA
		It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
		this past year.  Then Tan got hold of
		one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
		plates -- and started making superbills.

				LEE
			(understanding)
		And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

				ISABELLA
		Yes.  They've printed and shipped one
		hundred million dollars, and there's
		only one way to spot a fake.

	Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
	RED.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		They use an optical transfer ink from
		India that burns red -- the real ink
		burns black.

				CARTER
		What the hell are they going to do with
		a hundred million dollars in funny
		money?

				ISABELLA
		The real question is, where are the
		plates?  If we can find the plates, we
		can stop the whole operation.

	Isabella thinks for a beat.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Maybe that's where you can help us. 
		Carter, this is your city, right?

	Carter nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

	Lee nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
		plates.
			(hands Lee a card with a phone
			 number)
		Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this
		moment on, you're working for the United
		States Secret Service.

	Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit
	quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on
	Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
	number.

				STERLING (O.S.)
		Sterling.

				ISABELLA
		Lee and Carter are officially out of the
		Secret Service's way...

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
	the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
	Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

				CARTER
		Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my
		calling, Lee. 
		Give me six months and I'll be in
		Washington protecting a white guy.

				LEE
		We both know you would never take a
		bullet for someone else.

				CARTER
		They don't know that.  What are they
		gonna do, try and shoot the President
		during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella
		can pull some strings.  You saw the way
		she was staring at me.

				LEE
		She never even looked at you.

				CARTER
		You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
		me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
		third world ugly.

				LEE
		I am not third world ugly.  Women like
		me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

				CARTER
		Snoopy is about six inches taller than
		you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
		chance.

	Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee
	reluctantly gets in, too.
			
			EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.  

	INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables
	are occupied.

	INT. KITCHEN

	Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
	BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
	worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
	woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half
	Asian kids run around the kitchen.

				CARTER
		Kenny!  How you doin'?

	Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		How's the action tonight?  The house
		making out okay?

	Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

	INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
	big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very
	smokey and very crowded.

				CARTER
			(to Kenny)
		This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
		voice, they all scream and run and shit. 
		Watch.  It's real funny.

	Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

				KENNY
		Come with me.

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

				KENNY
		Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
		Kong, James.

				CARTER
		What??  Where'd you hear that?

				KENNY
		I got my sources.

				CARTER
		And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how
		that works out.
			(beat)
		I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
		place down.

				KENNY
		James, you see my kids back there?  You
		know how much I'm paying for private
		school?  How can you come in here with
		this attitude, you being little Chang's
		godfather?

				CARTER
		Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
		his daddy in jail if you don't
		cooperate.

				KENNY
		Jail!?  James, you better back off. 
		Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

				CARTER
		I'd like to see you try.

	Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
	arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
	countering Kenny's move.

				KENNY
			(to Lee)
		We're on, then.

	Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
	Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

				LEE
			(impressed)
		That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
		did you learn that?

	They switch to Chinese.

				KENNY
		Master Ching taught me.

				LEE
		The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

				KENNY
		No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

	Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing hanging out with Baby
		Duck?

				LEE
		Baby Duck?

				KENNY
		That's what we all used to call him when
		he was a kid -- cause he was always
		quacking.  Never shut up.

				CARTER
		I heard that.

	Lee and Kenny laugh.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, I need some info and I don't have
		time to play around.

				KENNY
		Is this about the funny money?

				CARTER
		How'd you know?

				KENNY
		You've been asking loud questions in all
		the wrong places all morning.  How come
		you always save me for last, James? 
		When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't
		happen I don't know about.

				CARTER
		So tell me what you know.

				KENNY
		I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
		good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
		too, didn't you?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  We already been there.  This is
		big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service
		calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even
		tell the difference.

	Kenny considers this for a moment.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What?

				KENNY
		One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
		dollars at the table here last week.  I
		was about to send my boys down to tune
		his ass up, when the guy comes in and
		pays off the whole thing.  Including the
		vig -- brand new sequential hundred
		dollar bills.  I knew something was
		wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular
		job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
		in cash. 
		But I tested the bills, infrared.  The
		whole thing.  And they checked out. 
		100%.

				LEE
		Do you still have the bills?

				KENNY
		I still have my lunch money from third
		grade.

				CARTER
		Lemme see 'em.

	Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. 
	He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter
	checks it out.

				KENNY
		See.  It's perfect.

	Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		Whoa, what are you doing?

	Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
			(pissed off)
		I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He
		works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

				CARTER
		All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off
		the hook.  For now.

	Carter and Lee move for the door.

				KENNY
		You sure you guys don't want to stay and
		have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu
		shu this side of Compton.

	Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
			
			EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

	Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.

	EXT. REIGN SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee enter.

				CARTER
			(to a worker)
		We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is
		he here?

	Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter
	and Lee exchange looks and run after him.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and
	down some stairs.  Carter and Lee in pursuit.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
	stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

	HU LI

	Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing
	near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER
	in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is
	parked beside it.

	Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of
	the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
	putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink
	without getting mowed down.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
		be remembered for ridding the Triads of
		your petulance.

	Hu Li savors the moment.

				CARTER
		I hope you just said I have no business
		being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

	Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
	freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several
	feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

				ISABELLA
		Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
		want to talk to them first.

	Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee
	falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
	of her gun.

	BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
	the jaw with her fist.

				CARTER
		...oh, that's a filling right there. 
		That's gonna cost you.

	Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

				HU LI
		Put them in the truck.

	The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

				CARTER
		I should kill you right now, but I'm
		gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
		and maybe you can be reformed.

	The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck
		myself.

	As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
	look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
	COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

	The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
	pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

	EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

	The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

	INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

	LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

	They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
	Carter is flexing his battered body.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				CARTER
		What's the first thing I told you --
		never trust nobody.  How could you fall
		for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

				LEE
		She saved our lives.

				CARTER
		For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's
		playing both sides.

	Lee looks disappointed.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a
		thing for her.

				LEE
		Shhh, my head hurts.

				CARTER
		I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"
		me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky
		Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang
		Long are not in South Central.  I didn't
		have to help you.

				LEE
		Why did you help me?

				CARTER
		It doesn't matter.

	Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

				LEE
		I'm not used to having a partner.

				CARTER
		We are not partners.  Between your
		daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just
		took, as far as I can tell all partners
		get you is dead.

				LEE
		Well we're not friends.

				CARTER
		You got that right.  And we ain't
		brothers.  Maybe we should just end this
		right here.

				LEE
		Fine with me.

				CARTER
		I won't talk to you, you don't talk to
		me.  We'll die in peace.

				LEE
		See you in the next world.

	A BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER
		I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I
		won't see you in the next world.

				LEE
		Fine. 

				CARTER
		I believe in heaven.  You people believe
		in heaven?

				LEE
		Yes.  We have heaven.

				CARTER
		Is it the same heaven, or is it a
		Chinese heaven?

				LEE
		What's a Chinese heaven?

				CARTER
		I thought it might be like those five
		foot and under basketball leagues.  They
		don't let everybody in.

				LEE
		I think we should stop talking.

				CARTER
		Fine by me.

	ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You thinking about that girl that dumped
		you?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		If she was the right girl, you'd be
		thinking about her.

				LEE
		Mind your own business.

				CARTER
		How was the sex?

				LEE
		There was no sex.  She was very
		traditional.  We were waiting until we
		were married.

				CARTER
		You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No
		mu-shu?

				LEE
		No mu-shu.

				CARTER
		What about a little king pao chicken?

				LEE
		No kung pao chicken.  Never.

				CARTER
		Steamed dumplings?

				LEE
		Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But
		only when she was drunk.

				CARTER
		That's rough, man.  If I don't get
		steamed dumplings once a week, I go
		crazy.

				LEE
		Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think
		I have a good voice?

				CARTER
		Are you serious?

				LEE
		Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

	Lee turns away from Carter.

				CARTER
		As long as you're asking...I think you
		have a pretty good voice.

				LEE
		I knew it.  What does she know.  You
		want me to sing something?

				CARTER
		That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long
		usually kill their victims?

				LEE
		They'll probably torture us first, shock
		our privates, then put two bullets in
		our eyes and one in the back of the
		head.

				CARTER
		Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

	Lee clears his voice.

				LEE
		Did you happen to see the most beautiful
		girl in the world...and if you did, was
		she crying, crying...hey!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

	The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that
	is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

				HU LI
		Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,
		the dragon's been fed.

	She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best
	to appear completely uninterested.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

	INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

	Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,
	takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
	spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They
	start prying the crate open.

				CARTER
		Very nice.

				LEE
		It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak
		spot.  You ignore everything around you,
		and put all your energy into one perfect
		strike.

				CARTER
		I'll remember that next time I'm
		fighting a box.

	Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about
	$1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hello, Benjamin.

				LEE
		Who's Benjamin?

				CARTER
		Benjamin Franklin, he discovered
		electricity.

				LEE
		A Chinese man discovered electricity.

				CARTER
		No Chinese man discovered electricity.

				LEE
		Yes he did.  He also invented the
		bicycle.

				CARTER
		Now that I believe.

	Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You never know.  Besides, I always
		wanted to die rich.

	The truck lurches.

				LEE
		We're slowing down.  This must be it.

				CARTER
		End of the line.

				LEE
		You've been a good friend, James Carter.

				CARTER
		Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting
		corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass
		from here to Compton.

				LEE
		You could never kick my ass.  You mama's
		boy.

				CARTER
		Don't you talk about my mama.
			(winks at Lee)
		That's more like it.

	EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

	The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's
	approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the
	TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

	Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the
	truck bed is EMPTY.

	Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

	ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

	Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
	bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

	Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
	to the ground.  In the next instant:

	ON LEE

	still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
	onto the roof of the truck.

	ON CARTER

	who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
	use a shield as gunfire erupts.

	Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
	ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
	and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
	the first two guards.

	Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
	CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
	the closest way out:

	A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

	INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the
	underground loading docks.

				LEE
		This way.  I see some lights.

	Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a
	MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that
	lead up to the street.

	EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

	The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.  

	CLOSE ON

	Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
	together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
	VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
	light show in the world.

				LEE
		Vegas...

				CARTER
		Lee.  I just got an idea how someone
		could launder a hundred million dollars
		in cash.

	They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

	A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
	SECONDS.
			
			EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

	FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
	at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
	EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

				LEE
		Red Dragon.

				CARTER
		That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

	Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
	hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the
	rich are making their way inside.

				LEE
		Let's go.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  We can't go in like
		this.  Look at this place, we gotta look
		fly.  We gotta Mac out.

				LEE
		What is Mac out?

				CARTER
		Follow me my Asian brother.

	Carter and Lee start to walk away.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just stay down wind, because I think you
		stepped in some serious rat shit down
		there.

	EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

	INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

				SALESMAN
		May I help you gentlemen?

	Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of
	superbills.

				CARTER
		Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this
		body but pure silk.  And get my partner
		something from the children's
		department.

	Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				SALESMAN
		Would your partner like silk as well?  I
		personally like it when a couple
		matches.

	Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's
		no couple here.  Just two single police
		officers working a very dangerous case.

				LEE
		Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing
		us.

				SALESMAN
		I'm sure all the boys are chasing you
		two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys
		the bell of the ball.

	He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

				CARTER
		This is the last time I go shopping with
		you.

	EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
	tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. 
	Le is awkward in "player" guise.

				CARTER
			(whispering)
		Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You
		own the place.

	Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
	they walk through the doors.

				LEE
		I own the place.

	INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to
	imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT
	BUDDHA --

				CARTER
		That looks exactly like my Uncle
		Darrell.

				LEE
		Buddha is the symbol of luck and good
		fortune.

				CARTER
		Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. 
		The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

	They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA
	COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

	RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The
	MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around
	the perimeter - a sign reads:

				SIGN
		$50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN
	on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

				STEVEN REIGN
		A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
		village in China hired a young Dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  Their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
			(beat)
		Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that
		lost treasure.  It is here, inside the
		greatest casino in the world!  Welcome
		to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a
		winner!

	Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. 
	Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
	waiting.

	A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

	Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on
	the balconies above.

	Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's
	nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down
	the red carpet.

				CARTER
			(to waitress)
		Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...
			(to a cigarette girl)
		Get us a box of your finest cigars.
			(to a change girl)
		Give me ten dollars in nickels.
						
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON

	Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Seven!

	We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

	Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

	GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main
	cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

				CARTER
		Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest
		front in the world.

	As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his
	way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

				LEE
		Carter...here comes the rich white man.

				CARTER
		Wait here.  I'll handle this.

	As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the
	dance floor.

	INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

	The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the
	dance floor lights.

				ISABELLA
		Put your arms around me.

				LEE
		Excuse me?

	Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

				ISABELLA
		Hold me close.  There's cameras
		everywhere.

	An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his
	best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and
	Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her
	face.

				LEE
		What's going on?

				ISABELLA
		I need your help.

				LEE
		Last time you needed my help I ended up
		in the back of a truck.

				ISABELLA
		I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You
		have to trust me.

	Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,
	sensual rhythm.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		You move well.

				LEE
		Just trying to make it look real.

				ISABELLA
		Look over there.  That's the eye in the
		sky room.

	Lee looks over her shoulder. 

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Behind me is the soft count room.  We're
		pretty sure the plates are back there.

				LEE
		Why don't you go get them?

				ISABELLA
		If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

				
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter
	steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

				CARTER
		Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody
		get a picture, we can use it for a mug
		shot.

				STEVEN REIGN
		Detective Carter, you always seem to
		show up where you don't belong.

				CARTER
		Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I
		want the truth.  Is there any way I can
		date your daughter?  Just dinner and a
		movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

				STEVEN REIGN
		Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I
		crawled out from under the first rock. 
		Do you really think you can intimidate
		me here?

				CARTER
		You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most
		counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
		dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure
		genius.

				STEVEN REIGN
		You play games with me, Detective, and
		you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. 
		The odds are always in favor of the
		house.

	Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

	INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

	Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		The Secret Service almost busted Reign
		at his casino in Macao, but the place
		burned down before we could move in.

				LEE
		How do I know I can trust you?

				ISABELLA
		Dip me!

	Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'm asking for real now -- will you help
		the Secret Service?

				LEE
		No.
			(beat)
		But I'll help you.

	Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. 
	He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
	Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

				CARTER
		Lee, what the hell are you doing?

				LEE
		Dancing?

				CARTER
		Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong
		arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the
		line, and you're up here dancing with
		some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

				LEE
		It was Isabella.  She says the plates
		are in the soft count room.

	Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD
	standing in front of a small door.

				CARTER
		Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She
		almost got us killed.  She's setting you
		up again!

				LEE
		No.  I'm going to find out.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  There's guards all over
		the place.  You'll need a distraction.

	Carter looks around the casino.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'll go to the craps table, make a big
		scene.  When security comes over, you
		make your move.  

				LEE
		Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

				CARTER
		I'll give it my best shot.
						
			INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Sir, you're aware that we require a
		fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
		here this weekend?

	Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the
	table.

				CARTER
		I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a
		hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet
		Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,
		people, I came to play.

	The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What the hell is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Those are five hundred dollar chips.

				CARTER
		Did you give me five-hundred dollar
		chips because I'm black?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, I just assumed...

				CARTER
		You assumed a brother coming in here can
		only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
		is that right?  Are you a racist?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, sir.

				CARTER
			(starting to scream)
		Everyone else at the table has thousand
		dollar chips, but the black man gets the
		nickel, is that it?  Did my people
		survive two-hundred years of slavery so
		you could send us back to the cotton
		fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
		Do I look like Chicken George to you?

	The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

				PIT BOSS
		Floor security, we have a problem at
		table nine.

	EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

	The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
	towards Carter's table.

	INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

	TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

				CARTER
		Answer me one question.  How come Ben
		Vereen isn't performing here at the
		hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough
		for you people?

				PIT BOSS
		Lionel Ritchie is performing here
		tonight.

				CARTER
		Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since
		the Commodores.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

	Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way
	into the soft count room.

				CARTER
		I have a dream, where black people and
		white people can gamble together without
		getting different chips!

	A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push
	their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls
	upstairs.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

	Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as
	the Security Guards move in.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you.  Now in the spirit of
		brotherhood, let's play craps!

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
	walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

	He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
	the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
	of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
	trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
	directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
	ceiling.

	WE SEE LEE'S FACE

	as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
	words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

	Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
	of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
	On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
	toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

	Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
	blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
	the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
	Isabella has set him up again.

	He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

				LEE
		Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have
		change for a twenty?

	The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
	down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
	MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
	the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
	right cross.

	Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
	stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
	to Lee's throat.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		Open your mouth.

	She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
	She holds the detonator in her hand.

				HU LI (CONT'D)
			(continuing in Chinese)
		That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. 
		Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
		into your brain.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
	rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner six!

				CARTER
		How much is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Two-hundred thousand!

				CARTER
		Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants
		a hundred dollars?

	Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
	AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Here, your highness, have a hundred
		dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

				GAMBLER
			(South African accent)
		I am not royalty, sir.

				CARTER
		Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My
		great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
		we probably cousins, man.  How much you
		got on the table?

				GAMBLER
		One million.

				CARTER
		Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who
		wants to blow on my hand for luck?

	Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
	YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
		blows on my hand for luck?

				TEXAN
			(embarrassed)
		She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

				CARTER
		Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come
		on, baby, give me some luck.

	The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Nice blowing.  When's your next
		birthday, I'll be the cake.

				TEXAN
		Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

				CARTER
		Don't threaten me.  I got friends in
		this town that will bite off your ears. 
		Just sit tight, because I've got the
		dice and I am on fire!

	Carter throws the dice.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner, seven!

	The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

				CARTER
		Let it ride!
						
			INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
	sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into
	the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
	stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
	casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

	Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
	his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Imagine a business where people hand you
		money.  And you hand them back
		absolutely nothing.

	Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
	Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
	sight of Ricky Tan alive.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Now that's a true American dream. 
		Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
		very greed driven US Customs agent.

	Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You
		know it didn't have to be like this. 
		But it's too bad!  Like father, like
		son.

	Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
	the monitors.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		He's going for the plates.

	Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
	walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
	SUITE.

				RICKY TAN
		Look at this old fool, what does he
		think he's doing?

	Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		It's almost impossible to find a partner
		that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
		you agree, Lee?

	ON ANOTHER SCREEN

	We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
	Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
	Isabella as he goes.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Well, at least you will die with honor. 
		But choy Gien.

	SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
	surrounding him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Four, winner!

				CARTER
		I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
		That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those
		here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me
		out!

	Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
	Carter's table.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
		cashier.

				CARTER
		That would be great.  Don't want any of
		these rich white people to jump me.

	As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
	glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

	Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Chai Hu Li.
			("Little Fox")
		Have fun.

	Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
	plays with the button.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
		this button.

	Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
	blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
	her gun.

	Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
	his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
	knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		It's time to end this, Inspector.

	Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
	from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
	sticking the gun under her chin.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Don't move!  United States Secret
		Service.

	Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
	hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
	the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

	Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
	rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

	THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

	They're about to move in.

				HU LI
		Get the detonator!

	The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
	KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

	One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
	gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
	back.

	Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

	Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CASHIER

	Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

	CRASH!

	An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
	In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

	The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

				CARTER
		Lee!!

	The guards restrain him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lemme ask you something.  Any of you
		ever felt $500,000 before?

	He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
	as the GUARDS hit the floor.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Doesn't feel so good, does it?

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it
	from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES
	OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
	DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
	Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
	detonator on her rounds.

	Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
	BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
	but he does see:

	ACROSS THE CASINO

	Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
	bay with a croupier stick.

				CARTER
		Black man gets on a hot streak and
		you're all trippin'?

	Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same
	simultaneous though:

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(help!)
		Lee!

				LEE
			(help!)
		MMMMMM!!!!

	Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
	But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
	is the HIGH WAY.

	Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
	Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
	He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
	landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
	side.

	Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
	the Sky Room.  He grins.

				CARTER
		Check it out.  Catfight!

	POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the
	floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other
	to get to it first.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
	arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
	plea MUFFLED.

				CARTER
		What the HELL are you doing with tape on
		your face?

	No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
	and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
	and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
	between swings.  Suddenly:

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

	Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
	as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the
	EXITS.

	THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
	on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		This can't be good.

	Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
	high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
	it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

	WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
	the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

	ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
	STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

	The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
	up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
	Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

	Hu Li lifts the detonator.

	Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

	Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

				LEE
			(diving on Carter)
		Bomb!!!

	Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

	KABOOM!

	The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash
	volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. 
	SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

	AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

	Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines. 
	The place is deserted.

				CARTER
		Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
		your mouth?

				LEE
		I did!

				CARTER
		No you didn't!

				LEE
		Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

	A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
			
						LEE (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is alive.

				CARTER
		What?!?!

				LEE
		We have to get to the Penthouse.

	Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
	of the casino.

				CARTER
		Hold on!

	Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
	But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see
	what is holding him up.  

	Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You go after Ricky.  I got this.

				LEE
		Carter...

				CARTER
		Just GO!

	Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE
	TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
	short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

	DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

	Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her
	long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,
	flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'm not gonna hold you back this time
		just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna
		pretend you're a man.

	She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
	undershirt.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		A very beautiful man with a perfect body
		who I'd like to take to the movies.

	She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
	like a master.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I may have been absent the day we went
		over this in karate class.

	Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
	soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for
	another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

	INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

	Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND
	cuts through, parting the doors.

	It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				ISABELLA
		I'm fine.

	She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and
	holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

				LEE
		I didn't know which side you were on.

				ISABELLA
		Now you know.

	DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
	- the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and
	steps into the elevator.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

	The elevator doors close.
			
	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
	HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
	black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
	comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

				RICKY TAN
		American's love to gamble.  Don't they,
		Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
		leaving.

				RICKY TAN
		And my plates?

				STEVEN REIGN
		They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
		have a problem with that.

	Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
	starts to walk toward the door.

				RICKY TAN
		I enjoyed that little story you told
		about the Dragon and the treasure.  My
		mother used to tell it to me all the
		time.  Do you know the moral of that
		story, Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		Greed will imprison us all.

	Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

				RICKY TAN
		I hate that fortune cookie shit.

	Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
	dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.

	Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
	Carter's hands.

				CARTER
		Will you STOP?!?!
			(picks up cocktail umbrella)
		What am I supposed to fight you with?

	No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
	WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
	got nowhere to hide.

	She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
	against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
	kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

	THWACK!

	The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
	she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
	at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

	Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
	HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		When are you people gonna learn?  Don't
		mess with the brothas!

	WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
	reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
	covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Benjamin!

	Carter runs for the elevator.
						
				INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
	body.

				RICKY TAN
		You're just like your father, Lee.  All
		these years hiding behind his badge.  I
		wanted to help him, to share with him,
		but he was too afraid of change.  When
		you think about it, I didn't really kill
		him.  I just put him out of his misery.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.  It's over.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think it's over.  There are
		casinos all over this country.  Let me
		make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
		the same mistake he did.

	Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

				LEE
		If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
		kill you.

				RICKY TAN
		Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

	Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
	taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
	Carter bursts in the room.

				CARTER
		Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
		up, Lee?

	Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
	like this before.

				RICKY TAN
		Would you like me to tell you how your
		father died?

				CARTER
		Lee, you okay?

	Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

				RICKY TAN
		He never begged for his life.  Or tried
		to make a deal.  All that he asked me,
		just seconds before I pulled the
		trigger, was that I promise not to kill
		you.

	Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
	trigger but can't.

				CARTER
		Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
		man.  He's making you do this.

				LEE
		It's worth it to me.

				RICKY TAN
		Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
		gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
		like your father?

				CARTER
		C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
		won, now just put the gun down.

	Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

				RICKY TAN
		That's what I thought.

	Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
	plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

	THE GUN IS LOOSE

	Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

	Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
	SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

	Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
	grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

	But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof. 
	SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
	WINNER!"

	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
	it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		I don't know about you, but I need a
		wine cooler.

	As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
	bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
	This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		We'll go together, Inspector.

				CARTER
		Please tell me she just asked for a ride
		to the airport.

	Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
	and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
	PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

	The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
	of the hotel.

	THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

	Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
	They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
	SIGN.

	It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

	Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
	TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
	The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

				LEE
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit!!

	They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
	and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
	STRETCH LIMO.
						
	INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
	try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
	when they realize they're alive!

				CARTER
		We made it, man.

				LEE
		No problem.

	Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
	OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
	them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
	night on the town.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		Well, there is a God after all.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
	the hotel.

				LIMO DRIVER
		Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

	In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
	CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		We're all going gambling and then to see
		Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are
		feeling lucky!

	INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

	Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
	Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
	Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
	Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

				CARTER
		I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
		You played it cool, though.  Walking
		away, never looking back.

				LEE
		She's going home to New York.  I need
		some ice.

	Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

				CARTER
		That your gate down there?

				LEE
		Yes.

				CARTER
		I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

				LEE
		I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

				CARTER
		You take care of yourself, Lee.

	Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
	like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

				LEE
		Carter, wait.  There's something I want
		you to have.

	Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

				CARTER
		Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I
		can't take this.

				LEE
		It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

	Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

				CARTER
		In that case, I got something for you. 
		I picked it up at the hotel.

	Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

				LEE
		What is this?

				CARTER
		About fifty grand.  I won it at the
		tables.

				LEE
		No, Carter.  I can't take this.

				CARTER
		It's okay, I got lots more.

	Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		They owe us, man.  That's the least they
		can do.

				LEE
		This money is evidence.

				CARTER
		Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
		minutes and live it up.  There must be
		something you want.

	Lee looks back toward Isabella.

				LEE
		I always wanted to go to Madison Square
		Garden.  See the Knicks play.

				CARTER
		New York City?

				LEE
		First class.

				CARTER
		The Plaza Hotel?

				LEE
		A little Mu-shu.

				CARTER
		Some Kung-Pao?

	They look at each other, smile.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I could use a little vacation.

				LEE
		Amen to that, brother.

	As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
	SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
	a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
	their way through the airport.

 THE S A I N T by Jonathan Hensleigh Director: Phillip Noyce February 8, 1995 New York City The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. - O. Wilde - FADE IN: The majestic city and bay, as seen from the elevation of the surrounding Shan Ho hills as we SUPER  HONG KONG  1965 PANNING away from the city, we come before the bleak facade of the SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE. BOY'S VOICE (o.s.) Simon Magus was a magician and sorcerer in uhhm... Sumatra. INT. HONG KONG - SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - DAY Twenty boys, aged 7 to 12, sit at spartan desks, bibles raised. FATHER O'NEAL walks amongst them. A career Jesuit with razor eyes and thin lips. An awful man. FATHER 0'NEAL (sternly) Sumeria. And what happened to him Francis? FRANCIS, 12, is the eldest and largest boy. FRANCIS Jesus' disciples came and performed miracles. When Simon Magus saw the miracles he offered disciple Peter gold for the powers of God. FATHER 0'NEAL What did disciple Peter say to that? Michael Quinn? Father O'Neal stands before the youngest, littlest boy, who, unlike the others, exhibits no fear in his huge, intelligent eyes. Father O'Neal hates this boy. The boy, MICHAEL QUINN, doesn't respond. Father O'Neal snatches his bible, revealing a SECOND BOOK hidden behind it. It's a dime store pulp adventure with a gaudy cover entitled "THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR." FATHER 0'NEAL Answer the question Michael. The little boy stares up at him. MICHAEL QUINN That's not my name. Father O'Neal yanks the boy from the chair. Drags him by the arm across the room and out into the corridor. THE OTHER BOYS wait two seconds, then they spring up and run, en masse, to the door. Grouped in the threshold, straining for a good view, they watch as -- FATHER O'NEIL pulls Michael Quinn into an office down the corridor. The door has a stained-glass window. It begins. We see it in SILHOUETTE: Father O'Neal with a CANE SWITCH in his hand, the boy beneath him. Down the switch comes. Again. And again. The boy YELPS. And again and again and again... and now he SCREAMS... THE BOYS HUDDLED IN THE DOORWAY begin to wince. With every repeated, merciless descent of the switch... INT. SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - EATING HALL - NIGHT THE BOYS sit at benches. Michael Quinn stares stoically ahead. The back of his shirt is striped with blood. FATHER YIN, 50's, a Chinese Jesuit, grim in black frock and white collar, paces amongst the benches. Father O'Neal watches from the side. FATHER YIN Why one child is born into a good home and another into poverty - that is but part of God's design. All of you are unwanted, put here because of the sins of your unwedded mothers. The church has fed you and educated you. Given you a home. A name. An identity. Stopping before Michael Quinn, he points to a PORTRAIT ON THE WALL of a stern-faced Jesuit. FATHER YIN Who is that, boy? MICHAEL QUINN Father Michael Quinn. FATHER YIN Yes. A great man. You ungrateful little cur, you will sit here without food until you appreciate your namesake. (to the other boys) All of you will sit with him. Put lunch away, Mr. Fong. MR. FONG, the orphanage cook, wheels a FOOD CART into the kitchen and locks the door. Father Yin exits, followed by Father O'Neal and Mr. Fong, leaving -- A HUNDRED BOYS staring at Michael Quinn. DISSOLVE TO: INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT Again, Father Yin stands before Michael Quinn. The boys are seated for their evening meal. FATHER YIN What is your name, boy? Silence. Michael Quinn stares straight ahead. FATHER YIN Put supper away, Mr. Fong. MR. FONG wheels the FOOD CART into the kitchen and locks the door. Again, a hundred boys stare at Michael Quinn. INT . ORPHANAGE BUNKROOM - NIGHT A long, narrow room with bunkbeds. The boys aren't sleeping. They're grouped around Michael Quinn's bunk. One boy has his hand clamped to Michael's, mouth, the others are wailing on him... and outside -- INT. ORPHANAGE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BUNKROOM - NIGHT Fathers O'Neal and Yin watch through the door. FATHER YIN Spareth the rod, spoileth the child. INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING Father Yin grits his teeth, staring down at Michael Quinn, whose face is welted. Nothing has changed. FATHER YIN Put breakfast away, Mr. Fong. Again, the FOOD CART goes into the kitchen. The Fathers and Mr. Fong exit. The boys rise, moving toward Michael Quinn. They're going to kick the living shit out of him. MICHAEL QUINN Stop. You'll have your breakfast. Michael Quinn walks to the locked kitchen door. The other boys, curious, follow. Michael Quinn kneels before the door, examining the lock. He looks around. On a counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS. Michael Quinn picks up A FORK. He bends the fork's tines. Inserts it in the lock. He fishes around for a second. Nothing happens. He pulls the fork out, rebends it, and inserts it in the lock again. And CLICK.. ..the lock pops. Michael Quinn turns and smiles. The boys flood inside. The hungry boys go for the food cart, scooping up eggs and sausage. They're ravenous. Francis, mouth full of sausage, beams at Michael Quinn. FRANCIS They should've named you Simon, like Simon Magus the sorcerer. MICHAEL QUINN No. Simon. . . . (pulls the "KNIGHTS TEMPLAR" paperback from his back pocket) ...Templar. Suddenly a SHARP WHISTLE. The boys, startled, whip their necks around. MR. FONG stands in the doorway. Father O'Neal and Father Yin enter quickly. The boys back away from the food cart. FATHER YIN Who.. . who did this...? The boys look at Michael Quinn. Then Francis speaks: FRANCIS I did father. And another boy, James: JAMES I did father. . And another and another: "I did father." They all say it. And the littlest youngest boy, surrounded by his new confederates, smiles slightly. His eyes glint. CUT TO: Begin MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA - NIGHT A chilly September night. A rally is underway in the Dvortsovaya Ploshchad, the vast square at the foot of Nevsky Prospect Boulevard. The Winter Palace and Hermitage loom in the b.g. 500,000 ST. PETERS BURGERS' stand shoulder-to-shoulder, listening to a SPEECH. INTERNATIONAL T.V. CREWS (the BBC, CNN, etc.) are transmitting the event. SPEAKER (o.s.) In I917 Lenin stood here and promised a new age. The result? Tyranny. Poverty. The darkest years in our history. THE SPEAKER stands on a platform behind a cluster of microphones, his image projected on a huge screen (like the Sony screen in Times Square) above and behind him. He is MICHAEL ROMANOV, coal-haired, fierce, ardent, eyes glinting like onyx, voice cutting the night air. ROMANOV In 1987 Gorbachev stood here and promised a new age. The result? An end to communism. Democracy. A free economy. And what else? Chaos. (crowd CHEERS) The economy run by criminals, the government run by charlatans. And they are in league together! Thieves! Traitors! (louder CHEERS) Men and women of St. Petersburg, citizens of Russia, the salt of this country, this must end! (deafening CHEERS) Join me then in the song of our forefathers. Romanov begins to sing, ably, the first verse of "Mother Russia" (the Russian anthem before the Bolsheviks). THE CROWD joins him. The Ploshchad rings with the voices of half a million Russians... CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIKKO HOTEL - CONTINUOUS We're 12 stories up, outside the city's Nikko hotel. The rally across town is a distant glow. We hear the singing crowd. TWO HANDS appear, gripping the nooks of the exterior architecture. A MAN IN BLACK climbs up, securing a sling to the window frame in which to sit. A bulky BACKPACK hangs from shoulder straps. He produces a diamond cutter; begins carving a man-sized aperture in the window. Below, in the foyer  INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM -- A JAPANESE SECURITY MAN sits at his guard station, watching C.N.N. NEWS on a small television. Wolf Blitzer is reporting live from the rally. WOLF BLITZER (on t.v.) An extraordinary allegation, Bernard, that Russia's present leadership, including President Victor Karpov, is connected with the country's underworld. Inside the foyer ballroom, Japanese businessmen are hosting a reception. The Nikko Hotel's core is hollow, like the Hilton in New York; thus, the ballroom's "ceiling" is 12 stories up. CHAMPAGNE SERVERS are passing out glasses. A grey-haired Japanese businessman, HIRO MYAKI, clinks his glass. The guests pay attention. During this we focus on a CHAMPAGNE SERVER moving toward the lobby elevators with a full tray. HIRO MYAKI Ladies. Gentlemen. The Myaki Corporation looks forward to many profitable days ahead. To our new manufacturing facility in St. Petersburg. To the new Russia! As the crowd CLAPS... EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - EXTERIOR WALL ...the Man In Black kicks at the cut section of window, pushing it into the hotel and plunging inside after it. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE The Man In Black catches hold of a steel girder and dangles, and, miraculously -- THE PIECE OF WINDOW doesn't fall. It's stuck to his feet with suction cups. The Man In Black moves, hand over hand, toward the mezzanine balcony, the window stuck to his feet. IN THE LOBBY BELOW Everybody's beaming, toasting, congratulating, etc., totally oblivious to THE MAN IN BLACK, 12 stories up, inching hand-over-hand across the roof superstructure. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE OVER MEZZANINE The Man In Black has reached the mezzanine. TWO JAPANESE SECURITY GUARDS, armed with automatic rifles, walk their shift directly below him. They pass a wall mounted television, also carrying the NEWS: WOLF BLITZER (on t.v.) One thing's certain, Bernard: Michael Romanov, age 32, French born and Oxford educated, descendent of the last czar, is a political force to be reckoned with. The guards move down the mezzanine; one jokes, the other laughs. They disappear around a corner. The Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he yanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups. He drops to the mezzanine. He rests the glass against the wall. He peers over the balustrade at the party below. Satisfied, he removes his hood, ENDING TITLES. This is SIMON TEMPLAR. A hard, self-reliant, crafty man. You should treat him as such or be very sorry you ever met him. It is unfortunate that a man of Templar's various talents can be so lacking. How? His journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast. This one gives no quarter. Ever. Though his outward self glows with life, he is dead inside. Templar, focused utterly, steals inside a corridor. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR A long corridor with a door at the end, on which is engraved: MYAKI CORPORATION. At the entrance, secured in a niche, is a BRONZE BUST OF HIRO MYAKI. Templar stops cold. A RUG (an oriental runner) extends the length of the corridor. Templar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug. Revealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS. Templar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool of steel cable attached to the top). He aims down the corridor and fires. A STEEL DART explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds above the door at corridor's end. Templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool. He looks around for something to secure it. TEMPLAR Sorry about this. He ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck. He hangs from the cable, testing it. It will hold. He pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips. It's A GLIDER for the cable. He attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of the corridor. THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR Templar bumps up against the door. He pulls his knees up and over the handles of the glider, then flops over backwards, hanging upside down. HIS FACE is now right next to the door handle, over which is an ELECTRONIC LOCK (opened by punching a code). Templar pulls out a BLACK BOX. It's a really small, really powerful computer and its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a minute and a half. Templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike ELECTRODE PROBES. He activates the system. The little computer starts running through combinations of numbers. He waits, hanging upside down. Meanwhile-- INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE - ELEVATOR LOBBY The Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing. One of these guys is a riot... The elevator opens. The CHAMPAGNE SERVER comes out, tray in hand. CHAMPAGNE SERVER Compliments of Mr. Myaki. JAPANESE GUARDS (delighted) Ahh! Beaming, they each take a glass. They clink and drink. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR The computer BEEPS. It's finished. Templar turns the door handle; pushes open the door. He pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again. He swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up. He releases from the glider and lunges inside. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES A grand boardroom with Japanese furniture and art. At the end of a fifty-foot mahogany table is a PAINTING OF HIRO MYAKI. Templar walks over to it. TEMPLAR Sorry again. He RIPS the painting off the wall and heaves it aside. And here, where the painting was, is A SAFE. Templar unshoulders his backpack. He pulls out a 40-pound CARLSBAD & RINKER industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer. No finesse here, people. No, there's no time for high-tech. He's going to drill right through the bitch, right through four inches of tungsten steel. He starts setting up the drill. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE LOBBY Two CHAMPAGNE GLASSES lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess lie the JAPANESE GUARDS, now unconscious. The champagne server's gone... INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE ...because he's here, moving quickly toward the Myaki Corporation's office, and he's not a champagne server, but a thief and a killer, a blonde Russian named ILYA. Ilya stops just outside the interior corridor. With the GUARD'S KEYRING, he shuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR Ilya stops short. His eyes spark. He sees Templar's cable and glider. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES Templar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as THE BIT CHEWS into the tungsten lock. This is a violent exercise. SINEWS OF METAL spit out like shrapnel. He's through the lock in seconds. Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with a THUD on the beautiful mahogany table. He opens the safe. INSIDE THE SAFE is one object: A SMALL BOX, the size of a cufflink keeper. Templar grabs it and opens it. INSIDE THE LITTLE BOX is a tiny MICRO-CHIP. Templar closes the box and pockets it. ILYA (v.o.) Don't move. Templar freezes. His eyes twitch. This wasn't in the plan... ILYA (v.o.) Turn around. Slowly. Templar faces Ilya. Ilya has a silenced handgun. ILYA On your knees. (Templar sinks to his knees) Give me the box. Slowly. Templar pulls out the box. Tosses it to Ilya. Ilya raises the handgun at Templar's head. Smiles. Try something: throw an extension cord on the ground. I guarantee it will land coiled in several places. Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension cord. And this is not lost on Templar. Templar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around Ilya's ankles. His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun clattering across the floor. Ilya tries to get to his feet. Templar floors him with a right cross. Templar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room. Ilya gains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE Templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it. He jumps, clutching the ceiling girder above. He's going out the way he came in. Suddenly ILYA'S HANDS are around his ankles. Templar falls. He's going 12 stories to his death. No. His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade. Templar dangles there, looking up at the sadistic face of Ilya. And suddenly below -- INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM -- A JAPANESE WOMAN, looking up, pointing at the man dangling from the balustrade above, SCREAMS. And now everybody looks up. HIRO MYAKI Sound the alarm! Call the police! INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE Ilya and Templar. Ilya calmly compresses his foot against Templar's left knuckles. ILYA The box please. Templar, grimacing, reaches with his right hand and pulls the box from his pocket. Hands it slowly to Ilya, who reaches over the balustrade for it... TEMPLAR stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs Ilya's hand, jerking him over the balustrade. Ilya falls 12 stories to his death. No he doesn't. He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade there. Templar clambers up again, atop the balustrade. He jumps to the ceiling girder. Hand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in seconds. He releases from the girder to the window frame. There's one further problem. BULLETS. Ricocheting all around him. Fired by -- ILYA, one floor down. Templar reaches over his shoulder. Pulls a GUN from his backpack. To return fire? No, it's the DART GUN. Templar aims the dart gun out the aperture he cut in the window and fires. EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - 12TH FLOOR A STEEL DART launches from the window, flies fifty yards, and imbeds in the STAIRCASE BULKHEAD OF THE BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE NIKKO. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE Templar ties the cable to the ceiling girder. He pulls out his black hood and drapes it over the taught cable. He grabs both ends of the hood. And he jumps. EXT. NIKKO HOTEL/ADJACENT BUILDING Templar flies through space, across the cable, the hood acting as a makeshift glider. He lands on the roof of the adjacent building. Templar looks around. SIRENS ARE WAILING. He runs across rooftops, disappearing into the St. Petersburg night. INT . NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM Total chaos. Women screaming, everybody running around. Ilya comes through the panicked crowd. Ten ST. PETERSBURG POLICEMEN enter. ILYA I tried to stop him! He went out the window! Five policemen go for the elevators. Five more exit quickly. Ilya follows. EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - ENTRANCE The befuddled police race off, looking skyward at the top floors of the building. Ilya curses silently. And peels away from the cops and commotion, off into the night. CUT TO: INT. A BRITISH-AIR 747 - MORNING The First Class section. The plane is in flight. A STEWARDESS, young, perky, comes down the aisle pushing a magazine/newspaper cart. STEWARDESS Newspaper sir? SIMON TEMPLAR sits there, dressed as usual without much heed to fashion. Note this, reader: Templar is not a super-spy, super-hero, or super-rake. He is a thief. He's examining several antique Russian BRACELETS and LOCKETS. He looks up at the stewardess. STEWARDESS (Cockney) Wow, are those gorgeous or what... TEMPLAR You have an eye for beauty. Of course - you see it every time you look in the mirror. She blushes, fidgets, as his eyes bore in on her. STEWARDESS Why thank-you, Mr... (reads seat assignment) Templar. She continues down the aisle, smiling to herself. Templar resumes with his lockets. INT. BRITISH AIR 747 - FIVE HOURS LATER The plane has landed. PASSENGERS are filing out past the Stewardess. STEWARDESS Goodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in London, etc. Templar moves past the Stewardess, carrying TWO CARRY-ON BAGS. He winks at her. She winks back, and fingers one of the RUSSIAN LOCKETS, now around her neck. STEWARDESS Good-bye, Mr. Templar. As Templar moves off, she smiles to herself and CUT TO: INT. LONDON - HEATHROW AIRPORT Templar walks briskly away from customs. A MAN IN TRENCHCOAT falls in behind Templar. TWO MEN appear in front of Templar, blocking his path; the man behind Templar comes to his side. They are Scotland Yard men BAKER, TEAL, and INSPECTOR MACDUFF. INSPECTOR MACDUFF How's the weather in St. Petersburg? TEMPLAR Cold. INSPECTOR MACDUFF Let's warm things up for you. Baker and Teal gruffly take Templar by the shoulder and walk him forward and CUT TO: INT. HEATHROW CUSTOMS - INTERROGATION ROOM A spartan room, a table and two chairs. MacDuff ransacks TEMPLAR'S BAGS while, across the room -- Templar kisses the wall, hands outstretched, as Baker finishes frisking him. Templar turns. BAKER He's clean. TEMPLAR (to MacDuff) Careful with that. It's delicate equip... MacDuff lifts Templar's 9MM PISTOL from the bag. TEMPLAR . . . ment. MACDUFF Yes. Very. TEMPLAR It's for protection. I deal in antique.... MACDUFF (snaps) I know what you deal in. And these? Your pajamas? He holds up Templar's black bodysuit. TEMPLAR For jogging. My doctor's recommended five miles a... MACDUFF Sit down and shut it. Templar sits down. Baker has Templar's papers. He holds up a certificate. BAKER He's licensed to carry, Inspector. MACDUFF Let's see the passport. (Baker hands MacDuff Templar's passport) What's your nationality this week, Templar? TEMPLAR I forget. MACDUFF (looks at passport) Issued by the Principality of.. . Yemen? You're bloody joking. TEMPLAR (shrugs) Call the embassy MacDuff whips the passport at Templar. Templar calmly moves his head; the passport flies by. Hits the wall. MACDUFF Shut it. MacDuff leans down, coming in close. Templar doesn't blink. His expression never changes. MACDUFF You pass through Russia for a day with that gear and, what a surprise, a prototype computer chip worth quarter of a billion quid is nicked from the Myaki Corporation the night you arrive. We know you didn't fence it in Russia. Where is it? The door opens. Teal enters, tossing several X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHS on the table before MacDuff. Two are of Templar's bags, two are of his body. TEAL (Cockney) All negative. He didn't swallow it. An embarrassing pause. TEMPLAR You've got three options: charge me, or release me. MACDUFF What's the third. TEMPLAR You can kiss my ass. A dreadful pause. MacDuff smiles. He turns away, then turns back and viciously backhands Templar across the face; Templar's head jerks. The blow would knock most men out. Now Templar smiles. Like a serpant. And says calmly: TEMPLAR I'm a busy man. Make up your mind. MacDuff stares at Templar, gritting his teeth. Templar rises. Begins collecting his things. CUT TO: INT. LONDON RESTAURANT - EVENING A quaint place off Piccadilly. The STEWARDESS (from Templar's flight) gulps a martini. She is tipsy. She shows it. STEWARDESS .. . then me mum says, call uncle Charlie, he's in the airline business, there's jobs there, good benefits too, and.. ..where was I? TEMPLAR, enduring this, sits opposite with a scotch. TEMPLAR How you got your job. STEWARDESS Right! (hiccups, giggles) 'Scuze me. Templar motions to a passing WAITRESS. TEMPLAR Another round please. STEWARDESS Ye're tryin' ta get me drunk, aren't you? Are you cute or what? I gotta freshen up. (she rises) Where's the loo in 'ere? TEMPLAR Back there. Leave your locket. I'll polish it for you. She smiles crookedly; hands over the locket. STEWARDESS Are you a dearheart or what... She blows Templar a kiss and lurches off to the bathroom. Templar watches her a moment. When she's gone he puts the locket on the table. He pries open the back of it with a pen-knife. INSERT - THE LOCKET - there is a compartment in which sits THE STOLEN MICRO-CHIP. Templar plucks out the chip and drops it into an envelope. BACK TO SCENE - FOLLOWING THE STEWARDESS as she returns to the table. She sits down. Looks around. Templar's gone. The locket's gone. The waitress appears. STEWARDESS Maam, where's the gent who was sitting 'ere? WAITRESS He left, luv. Said you'd take care of the bill. She hands the Stewardess the bill. She stares at it. STEWARDESS What? She sinks down, confused, blinking, near tears. CUT TO: INT. LONDON - MUSGRAVE HOTEL A small, plush, discrete residential hotel in the heart of Mayfair (Regent Street, Grovesnor Sq. or equivalent). TEMPLAR approaches the front desk with his carry-on bags. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON and the HOTEL MANAGER are behind the desk. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Mr. Templar! Good to see you sir. Your room key - south penthouse as usual. Your suits are up from storage, pressed of course, and there's a bottle of Oban on the dresser. TEMPLAR Thanks Harry. Oh, and Harry... (pulls out the envelope with the computer chip) .. . ship this by overnight courier to that address. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Very good sir. JIMMY, a young Bellman, takes Ternplar's bags. Templar doesn't let go. An uncomfortable pause. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Jimmy, Mr. Templar carries his own bags. Templar steps past Jimmy into the elevator. JIMMY THE BELLMAN What's with the bags, gov'nuh? HOTEL MANAGER They're all he ever brings. The man's bills are paid by a bank in Switzerland and his mailing address is a corporation in Lisbon. Bloody strange... CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Mr. Templar, strange? No sir, he's just shy. CUT TO: INT . MUSGRAVE HOTEL - SOUTH PENTHOUSE Ternplar sits at a desk with a bottle of Oban scotch and glass, staring at the screen of a modemed MINI-COMPUTER. -- Templar types: LION CONTACTING ZEBRA: IS ZEBRA HOME? -- And this comes back: AFFIRMATIVE, LION. -- Templar types: PIGEON IS FLYING; WILL ARRIVE A.M. -- And this back: EXCELLENT. LION GETS LION'S SHARE. -- Templar types a new command. A new screen appears: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* PRIVATE UNMARKED ACCOUNTS PLEASE ENTER SECURITY PASSWORD Templar types in: 77N8LS473Z. This appears: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* ACCOUNT OF: TEMPLAR, SIMON BALANCE (AS OF 8/1S/95): U.S. $47,895,12S.12 (Not a typo, reader. It's forty-seven million bucks.) Templar picks up his scotch and drinks, staring at the screen. He's waiting for something... The first digit, "4," vanishes. A "5" appears in it's place. Now fifty-seven million. Templar permits a slight smile, having just made 10 million dollars, and drinks his scotch. The phone RINGS. Templar eyes it skeptically. He picks it up. TEMPLAR Yes. A voice with an Eastern European accent: VOICE Is this Simon Templar? TEMPLAR It depends. VOICE A meeting. Midnight, Blackfriars Bridge. TEMPLAR Involving what? VOICE A lot of money. If you want it. Click. Templar recradles the receiver; He stares at it a moment and CUT TO: INT. MUSGRAVE HOTEL LOBBY - LATER - NIGHT Templar enters the lobby wearing a fresh suit under a black leather trench coat. He goes to the desk, where concierge Harry Winston looks up. TEMPLAR Harry, I'm going for a walk over Blackfriars Bridge. Midnight. Pause. And Harry, just perceptibly, nods. And returns to his obsequious self. HARRY WINSTON Very good, sir. Templar walks off through the lobby. HARRY WINSTON Jimmy (Jimmy walks over) It's about time I taught you how to run the front desk. CUT TO: EXT. LONDON - BLACKFRIAR' S BRIDGE - MIDNIGHT Fog. The bridge lights cast everything in a sickly yellow glow. Below, A TUGBOAT plows the river, horn BELLOWING. The lights of Southwark twinkle beyond. Templar enters from Victoria Embankment. TWO FIGURES emerge from the fog. Templar approaches. One is a huge dim-wit with greasy hair, as tall and wide as a bookcase. His name, aptly, is ZERO. The other is middle-aged and strongly built. A high forehead; clipped, irongrey hair; square jaw and aquiline nose; deep-set, ruthless, unblinking eyes. This is GREGOR TRETIAK. To characterize him as the John Gotti of Russia is to demean him. He is vastly more powerful. TRETIAK Interesting. (sizes up Templar) You are not a big man. But men like you never are. It is my pleasure, Simon Templar. My name is... TEMPLAR I know who you are. Tell me what you want, or I keep walking. TRETIAK Suppose I don't want anything. Suppose I want to kill you. TEMPLAR Suppose there's a high-powered rifle trained at your head. As Tretiak's eyes dart about, Templar raises his hand, waving, signaling to someone below the bridge -- BELOW THE BRIDGE - ON THE VICTORIA EMBANKMENT -- that someone is CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON, in a cloth cap and rain mack now, and yes, he has a 30.6 scoped rifle trained at Tretiak's head. BACK TO THE BRIDGE Tretiak's jaw muscles twitch. He smiles thinly. TRETIAK Rumour has not lied about you, Mr. Templar. Last night something was stolen in St. Petersburg. My city. TEMPLAR You talk about the place as if you own it. TRETIAK (sinisterly) I do, Mr. Templar. May I ask who hired you? TEMPLAR You can ask. I won't answer. TRETIAK What you stole I wanted very badly. (beat) Ilya. Ilya emerges from the shadows. Locks eyes with Templar. The thief from the Nikko! TRETIAK What is the saying - if you can't beat them, why not join them? An American phrase, no? Or are you British? Australian? TEMPLAR I'm nothing. Except bored. Get to the point. TRETIAK (smiles) Of course. An American scientist has worked ten years to develop a certain technology. I am informed that the technology will be made public at the annual nuclear science symposium in Washington D.C. I would like the plans and specifications for this technology. Before the symposium. TEMPLAR What are we talking about? TRETIAK A nuclear fusion generator. We have a man on the inside. TEMPLAR Why can't he steal it? TRETIAK He's tried. The scientist trusts no one and keeps no hard records of the technology in the lab. TEMPLAR Nuclear fusion. They say it's mankind's only hope after all the oil's gone. This guy's actually done it? TRETIAK She. TEMPLAR Come again? TRETIAK She, Mr. Templar. The scientist is a woman. (hands over a dossier) Her dossier. All the information you will need. TEMPLAR My fee is fifteen million U.S. dollars, half up front, half when I deliver. You'll hear from me. Templar turns and walks off. TRETIAK Templar, one question. Templar stops. Turns. TRETIAK I ask you to steal a person's entire life's work. You have no reaction. Are you that cold? Templar stares back, expressionless. He turns and disappears into the fog. TRETIAK No, rumor hasn't lied about you, Templar. CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - ESTABLISHING SHOTS Various establishing shots of this suburban community just north of Manhattan. Pretty, charming, affluent. INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - SUPERMARKET A large suburban supermarket. The aisles are full of Westchester women: affluent, country clubby, housewifey types. A HAND reaches for a BOTTLE OF LEMONADE (100% Natural) , bringing it down to the eye level of -- JILLIAN ST. THOMAS. She is lean, a swimmer's body perhaps, with terrific acuteness and authority in her thought, speech, and action. Debate this woman? Fine, but you'd better know what the hell you're talking about. Her stare can stop a train. She's casually dressed. Only her JACKET stands out. It's waist-cut, with a colorful diagram of protons and electrons circling a nucleus embroidered on the back. JILLIAN (reads ingredients) Filtered water, high fructose corn syrup. Lemon juice concentrate. Citric acid. Gum acacia...? (grumbles) Totally natural, yeah right. She returns the bottle and turns, coming face-to-face with SIMON TEMPLAR, wearing a moustache and glasses now. He has a bottle of LEMON JUICE in his hand. TEMPLAR Try this. (smiles) Sorry, I overheard. (hands her the bottle) The real thing. No chemicals, no preservatives. She reads the label. Satisfied, she looks at Templar. JILLIAN Thanks. She puts it in her cart and wheels off and CUT TO: INT. SUPERMARKET - PRODUCE SECTION - MINUTES LATER Jillian is examining apples. There is a THUMPING NOISE. It persists. Finally she looks over at -- TEMPLAR. He's standing in front of the watermelons. He's thumping one with his thumb. He notices Jillian. TEMPLAR Hello again. These aren't ripe. How are the apples? JILLIAN Excellent. They're in season. Templar walks over to the apples. Picks one up. Studies it for a moment. TEMPLAR I wonder why He didn't want us to eat these. A pause. She looks at him, puzzled. JILLIAN Who? TEMPLAR God. In the Garden of Eden. JILLIAN Oh right. Sorry, little slow today. Bad headache. (looks at the apple) Uhm, actually, I don't know. TEMPLAR Why wasn't it: "No bananas." Or: "Avoid, at all cost, kumquats." Wonder what God had against apples. She gives him a funny look and turns away. JILLIAN Sorry. Can't help you. TEMPLAR How about William Tell? You really think he shot one of these off his brother's head with an arrow? Jillian turns around again. A pause. JILLIAN Do I know you? TEMPLAR Unlikely. I just moved to New York. She stares at him. This is a very strange man. Intriguing yes, but also possibly a lunatic. She decides to take the dismissive route: JILLIAN Well uhhm, sir, to answer your apple questions, one, I don't know what God's problem was. Two, William Tell, like Paul Bunyon, never existed. And in case you're wondering, Isaac Newton discovered gravity through planetary observation not because one of those fell on his head, and I seriously doubt that eating one a day will keep the doctor away. (beat) Okay? She wheels her cart off. Says over her shoulder: JILLIAN By the way - welcome to the Big Apple. Templar watches her wheel off. His eyes glint. This is going to be interesting... CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER SUPERMARKET - PARKING LOT - DAY Jillian slams down the hatch of her station wagon, now filled with groceries. She gets in. The car pulls out of the parking lot. INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING Jillian, driving, drinking her lemonade, listens to a cassette tape. An authoritative, scholarly, Indian voice: VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) Nuclear fusion occurs when pairs of nuclei meet and their protons and neutrons fuse together into a single nucleus. The fused nuclei move off at high speed, producing energy. Nuclear fusion could provide us with almost unlimited power. JILLIAN No, really? Moron. VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) All you need are two hydrogen gases, deuterium and lithium, and a machine to make them fuse under controlled conditions. JILLIAN C'mon, Dr. Singh. Tell me something I don't know. Jillian sees something through the windshield. She turns down the volume and squints -- JILLIAN'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD A ROLLS ROYCE sits on the road shoulder. As we pass the Rolls, we see SIMON TEMPLAR standing next to it wearing a hopeless expression. BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN looks at the Rolls in the rear-view mirror. She frowns. JILLIAN Just keep driving. Jillian frowns again. Against her better judgment, she pulls over. Throws it in reverse. EXT. WESTCHESTER - SUBURBAN ROAD SHOULDER - DAY Jillian's station wagon backs up to the Rolls Royce on the road shoulder. Jillian gets out. TEMPLAR Hello! She walks up to him. Together they look down at THE REAR TIRE. It's flat, a pancake. JILLIAN Where's the spare? TEMPLAR I.. .well.. .I'm not really certain. JILLIAN You do know how to change a tire. TEMPLAR Sorry. (beat) I'm not very... mechanical. Jillian rolls her eyes. JILLIAN Give me your keys. Templar hands them over. They walk to the rear. Jillian opens the trunk. They both look down at -- . THE TRUNK'S INTERIOR - THE SPARE TIRE is also flat. TEMPLAR (sheepish) Sorry. Jillian rolls her eyes again. JILLIAN All right, where do you live? TEMPLAR Close. JILLIAN It's your lucky day. (begins to walk off) Come on. Templar watches her walk off. He smiles grimly. CUT TO: INT. JILLIAN'S CAR - DRIVING The car winds through Westchester roads. VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) Research has centered on a machine called a tokamak, developed in Russia, essentially a doughnut shaped tube that contains the gases to be fused. At this, Templar stares at the tape cassette. VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) The tokamak hasn't worked because the two gases must be heated to a temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees, and kept together for several seconds. JILLIAN Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak's got it all backwards. TEMPLAR Uhhm. Excuse me. Who is that? JILLIAN Him? A powerful, well-respected man who doesn't know a goddarnn thing what he's talking about. If I got one tenth of his funding... Jillian reaches down and yanks off the cassette player. She looks out the window, grumbling. They drive on. TEMPLAR It's the next left. First driveway on the right. EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - TEMPLAR 'S HOME Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circle of the largest mansion in Westchester County. Just stupendous. INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON Jillian stares, open-mouthed, at the mansion. JILLIAN You live here? (turns to him) Are you for real? He picks up Jillian's lemonade bottle. TEMPLAR Like the label says. No chemicals, no preservatives. JILLIAN (points at the house) You work for this or inherit it? TEMPLAR My father made shoes. I inherited the company. Now I make shoes. JILLIAN (looks at the house) That's a helluva lot of shoes. TEMPLAR Uhm listen, I'm not very good at this and I realize we just met, but I'm even-tempered, politically moderate, belong to no religious cults, have no children I know of, am free of communicable diseases, I happen to find you attractive... JILLIAN Wait a minute, hold on. Are you asking me out on a date? TEMPLAR Yes. JILLIAN How do you know I'm not married? TEMPLAR I believe the fourth finger on your left hand is... JILLIAN (quickly) Okay so I'm not married. I could have a boyfriend. TEMPLAR I'd be surprised if you didn't have several. JILLIAN Be surprised. Lemme give you a hand. Jillian pops the wagon's back hatch and gets out. Templar follows. They walk to the wagon's rear. JILLIAN What about you? There's no wife stashed on some island someplace? TEMPLAR No wife stashed on some island. They pick up Templar's groceries; each takes two bags. JILLIAN No mistress? C'mon. No bimbo on the side? TEMPLAR Not a one. They walk toward the mansion. JILLIAN Well, that's a start. Here's the deal with me: I am not particularly even-tempered, I'm staunchly liberal, belong to no religious cults but I do believe in God as a basic force of good, have no children because one has to have sex to do that and, well, let's not pursue that, am free of communicable diseases, see above, and you're an attractive man, if a little weird, and well.. .hell, why not. (smiles) You've got a date, shoemaker. What's your name? TEMPLAR Michael. Michael Quinn. They reach the mansion's front veranda. They set the groceries on a wicker couch. JILLIAN I'm Jillian St. Thomas. They shake hands. Jillian fishes for a pen. JILLIAN I'll give you my number. TEMPLAR Just say it. I have a good memory. JILLIAN (looks at him) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight. TEMPLAR Good. Great. I'll call you. JILLIAN I've heard that before. TEMPLAR I will call you. You saved me today. Thanks again. She walks off to her car. Templar turns toward the front door. Jillian suddenly stops. Turns. JILLIAN Hey. (Templar turns) What's my number? TEMPLAR (without hesitation) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight. JILLIAN smiles and continues toward the car, mumbling: JILLIAN And he has a brain. What do you know. AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR - TEMPLAR watches Jillian get in her wagon and drive off. Then Templar keys open the door and enters. INT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - DAY The place is empty. Totally. No furniture. Nothing. Just Templar's two CARRY-ON BAGS on the floor in front of Templar. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT It's late now. About 10 p.m. Templar sits on a packing crate in the vacant living room with a glass of scotch, studying Jillian's life. There are pages of personal data and many photographs: Jillian in cap and gown; Jillian in a lab coat; Jillian at the beach, etc. DISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: A LEGAL PAD, with Templar's handwritten note: NO HARD COPIES - COMPUTER SOFTWEAR TEMPLAR stares into the screen of his mini-computer. It is two hours later. INSERT - THE MINI-COMPUTER SCREEN - Templar has entered every detail of Jillian's life. Looks like this: Home state: Massachusetts Hometown: Milton Highschool: Milton Academy Highschool mascot: Bulldogs University: Harvard University mascot: Crimson It just goes on and on: names of parents, family members, teachers, pets, boyfriends; favorite movies, colors, sports teams, hobbies, etc. DISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: TEMPLAR finishes entering the details of Jillian's life. He copies it onto a 3 1/4 disk, pulls out the disk and shuts off the minicomputer. He leans down and picks up a SHOE BOX. Opens it. He lifts out a WOMAN'S SHOE and jerks the heel, which lifts away from the sole on hinges. revealing a hidden compartment, in which Templar places a small transistor. He clicks the heel shut. THE SHOE -- MATCH DISSOLVES TO: THE SAME SHOE, now on Jillian's foot and WIDEN TO -- INT. MANHATTAN - LE CIRQUE -- Jillian and Templar at a corner table in Le Cirque. The meal is over. They're drinking coffee, laughing, at ease. The "date" is going well. TEMPLAR I am not eccentric. JILLIAN No? You live in the biggest house in America but do your own shopping, you talk to strange women about the history of apples, and you give a first-time date.. . shoes? Isn't the tradition flowers? TEMPLAR You said you liked them. JILLIAN I do. I'm joking. They're beautiful. Thank-you. They smile at each other. A WAITER brings more coffee. There's a sudden commotion. Jillian and Templar look -- ACROSS THE ROOM - a group of WAITERS are clapping their hands for a YOUNG COUPLE seated at a table. JILLIAN (to the waiter) What happened? WAITER (smiles) He just asked her to marry him. Anything else? JILLIAN looks at the radiant young couple. Smiles. TEMPLAR Just the check please. (the waiter exits; Jillian looks at him) You didn't answer my question. Maybe it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should just shut up... JILLIAN No, it's all right. Okay: "Why Jillian never got married, chapter One:" I don't know where you're from. . . TEMPLAR Canada. JILLIAN I don't know what it's like there, but here, if a teenage girl doesn't want to be a cheerleader, or drink 'till she pukes every weekend, or talk endlessly on the phone every night about absolutely nothing, then she doesn't win many popularity contests, know what I mean? That pretty much took care of highschool. TEMPLAR College? JILLIAN Try earning double p.h.d.'s from Harvard before you turn twenty-three and having a social life. TEMPLAR Can I ask a personal question? (she nods) What's your I.Q.? JILLIAN (laughs) That's personal? My I.Q.? Let's just say it's high. TEMPLAR Very high. JILLIAN Yes, very high. As high as yours. TEMPLAR You don't honestly mean that. JILLIAN Oh, you're a smart one, shoemaker. It's in the eyes. I can always tell. They stare at each other. Neither averts eyes. JILLIAN I just don't often get the opportunity. It feels nice. TEMPLAR For me, too. (and he means this:) You're very pretty. JILLIAN Stop it. Flattery will get you... someplace. I don't know where yet. She smiles. The waiter arrives with the check; gives it to Templar. Jillian picks up her purse and takes her wallet out. Templar sees her doing this... TEMPLAR No no no, absolutely not. Put that away. JILLIAN It's not for us. It's for the couple over there. (points at the couple across the room) Waiter, put their bill on my card please. WAITER Maam? Are you sure? Jillian nods. The waiter takes Jillian's card, exits. Jillian smiles at Templar. [Due to his mean origins and evolution, Templar has witnessed approximately three charitable acts in his whole life, and this was the third.] Thus does Simon Templar smile uneasily back. CUT TO: INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT Neat, modest, non-descript. Jillian and Templar enter. Jillian walks across the living room into a bar alcove off the living room. JILLIAN I'll make the booze. Turn on the news. I want to catch up on that Russia thing. Templar turns on the T.V. His eyes rove around, casing the place. JILLIAN (o.s.) What do you want, Michael? I've got everything. TEMPLAR Scotch please. No ice. CNN EVENING NEWS with anchor BERNARD SHAW comes on. BERNARD SHAW (on T.V.) .. ..of the steadily growing NeoCzarist Party, leveled more allegations against President Victor Karpov. According to Romanov, two men, Gregor Tretiak... Templar looks at the T.V. and double takes. A PHOTO OF GREGOR TRETIAK has appeared on the screen. BERNARD SHAW (o.s.) .. . and Ivan Gracha... A PHOTO OF IVAN GRACHA, 50's, short, beady-eyed, sinister, appears on the screen. JILLIAN pokes her head out of the bar. JILLIAN What brand? BERNARD SHAW (o.s.) ...allegedly the most powerful of Russia's underworld bosses, are linked to President Karpov in illegal enterprises... JILLIAN walks over to Templar. They watch together. JILLIAN That country's going to explode. TEMPLAR It very well might. Oban. JILLIAN What? . TEMPLAR My brand of scotch. Oban. Have any? JILLIAN No, but there's a liquor store five minutes away. She grabs her coat, heads for the door. TEMPLAR Wait. Don't be ridiculous. She stops. Looks at him. JILLIAN I want to be ridiculous. (pause) Michael, I haven't had anybody over in...a long time. And I happen to like you. I want to do this right. Okay? (he smiles; nods) I'll be back in ten minutes. (points at fireplace) Build a fire. She winks at him and exits. Templar walks to the window and stands there, waiting. We hear Jillian's car start, see the headlights. TEMPLAR You're making this too easy, dear. He pulls from his pocket a BLACK CASE, flips it open, turns it on. On a miniature computer screen is a detailed map of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. Two locations are pulsing: 1) Jillian's house and 2) a moving object, transmitted from a homing device, which we now see  INT. JILLIAN' S CAR - DRIVING -- it's in JILLIAN'S SHOE as she stamps on the brake at a stoplight and waits and we CUT BACK to the house... INT. JILLIAN' SHOUSE - BACK HALLWAY TEMPLAR moves down the hall opening doors, looking for Jillian's lab. He moves quickly, ruthlessly. He comes to a heavily locked FIRE DOOR. He unpockets a set of burglar's tools. For Templar, these locks are a joke. He opens them with alarming speed. He pushes open the door, revealing a DESCENDING STAIRCASE. He descends. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BASMENT Templar finds a lightswitch and flips it on. His eyes widen. Here we find -- JILLIAN'S LABORATORY. A POOL OF WATER (the size of a small swimming pool) is surrounded by HUNDREDS OF TEST TUBES of various shapes and sizes containing chemicals. Templar moves through, eyes scanning everything. He sees JILLIAN'S COMPUTER. Walks over to it. He unpockets the HOMING SYSTEM and sets it on the desk. The PULSING LIGHT is still moving; Jillian hasn't yet reached the liquor store. He turns on Jillian's monitor and hard drive. The COMPUTER SCREEN blinks on. We see a MENU: A.) Personal finances B.) Income tax C.) Things to do D.) Addresses E.) Research Templar positions the cursor on "E.) Research" and hits "enter." The modem engages; this appears: ******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* PLEASE WAIT Then this appears: RETRIEVAL CODE: _____________________ TEMPLAR Smart girl. Send your data into cyberspace and only you can retrieve it. Because only you have the code. He unpockets the 3 1/4 disk containing the data from Jillian's life and pushes it into the disk drive. He types a command; a new screen appears: DATA ENTRY SYSTEM Press any key to begin Templar hits a key and the old screen reappears: ******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* PLEASE WAIT RETRIEVAL CODE: ______________________ But now, in the space next to "Retrieval Code," Templar's data appears. word after word, like this: -- "Massachusetts" -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED -- "Boston" -- -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED. -- "Milton" -- -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED -- "Milton Academy" -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED -- "Bulldogs" -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED It's incredibly fast, a new word appearing every second, as the system tries to crack Jillian's code. But the computer denies access to each word. The HOMING DEVICE suddenly BEEPS. The pulsing light has stopped, indicating Jillian is at the liquor store. Templar grimly turns back to the computer. CUT TO: INT. WESTCHESTER LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT The clerk, WALTER, hands Jillian her change. She exits with a SCOTCH BOTTLE in a brown wrapper. CLERK Goodnight Jillian. JILLIAN Night, Walter. INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY - NIGHT Templar paces; he looks at the homing device. The PULSING LIGHT is moving back toward Jillian's house. Templar looks at the computer; his system continues entering words: "Hendrix." ACCESS DENIED. "Purple Haze." ACCESS DENIED. "Red Sox." ACCESS DENIED. "Celtics." ACCESS DENIED. On and on...each is met with ACCESS DENIED. INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING - NIGHT Jillian, driving, turns on the radio. She hums along. INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY Templar stares at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulse is getting closer; it's do or die now... Templar's system suddenly stops. It has run through every word. Each has met with failure. TEMPLAR frowns. He yanks the system disk from the disk drive. He begins pacing... TEMPLAR Okay, think. Think. Templar suddenly gets an idea. He sits and types: "Tokamak." ACCESS DENIED Templar stares at the screen in frustration. He looks at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulsing light is getting really close. Templar concentrates with every brain cell. We can feel him think. He's remembering something. MEMORY FLASHBACK We're in Jillian's car again, when they first met. JILLIAN Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak's got it all backwards. BACK TO THE LABORATORY Templar grabs a pencil and notepad and spells out: TOKAMAK. Under this he spells it backwards: KAMAKOT. He turns to the computer and types: "KAMAKOT" And instantly this flashes: ACCESS GRANTED. TEMPLAR Open sesame. The retrieval begins: A DOCUMENT appears on the screen: THE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION Submitted by: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS Templar scrolls through the document; we see a dizzying display of graphs, tables, plans, specifications, etc. Templar pulls out the disk containing Jillian's data and shoves a fresh disk into the disk drive. He begins copying Jillian's research from harddrive to disk. He looks at the HOMING DEVICE. Christ, she's almost back.. .and indeed -- EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE -- Jillian's car comes wheeling into the driveway. INT. JILLIAN' S LABORATORY - NIGHT The document is copied. Templar grabs the copied disk from the disk drive and rips the slip of paper from the notepad. He flicks off the computer and sprints across the lab, then up the stairs. EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE Jillian reaches for the doorknob and enters -- INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE She comes in. TEMPLAR, relaxed, lounges on the couch, flipping through some magazines. He smiles: TEMPLAR That was quick. She walks past him to the bar alcove. JILLIAN Now Mr. Michael Quinn, let's have that scotch. Hey, what happened to the fire? TEMPLAR I thought we'd create our own. JILLIAN (smiles) Down boy. He gets up; goes to the fireplace; grabs some logs and lays them across the andirons and we -- DISSOLVE TO: THE LOGS, now gently burning. Cole Porter is playing. CAMERA PANS past Jillian's shoes on the carpet, past the Oban Scotch on the coffee table, now half empty, to -- -- the couch, where Jillian and Templar are locked in a heavy kiss. Jillian stops. JILLIAN Whoah whoah whoah, time to put on the brakes. Those lips oughtta be licensed buddy... TEMPLAR Sorry. I wasn't trying to... JILLIAN I know you weren't but if we keep going I'm gonna be the one who gets us both in trouble. Whew! (fans herself) Haven't felt like that for awhile. (she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes) Am I going to see you again? A pause. Perhaps, just perhaps, for the first time in his black life Templar's having a hard time lying... JILLIAN Michael? TEMPLAR (smiles at her) How about breakfast? JILLIAN It's a date. I'll walk you out, shoemaker. EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT In the threshold they kiss again. TEMPLAR Good-night. JILLIAN 'Bye. Drive safe. Templar walks off to his Rolls Royce parked in the driveway. He smiles at her and waves. He turns toward his car; his face goes hard and cold. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - CONTINUOUS LATE AFTERNOON On the Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's equivalent of the Champs-Elysees  MICHAEL ROMANOV stands on a raised platform outside the gates of a PALATIAL MANSION taking up a whole city block. TEN THOUSAND SUPPORTERS surround him. Many carry large, slogan-filled banners. Four THUGGISH-LOOKING MEN stand guard inside the mansion's compound, giving Romanov the eye. One is ZERO (Tretiak's bodyguard on Blackfriars Bridge). MICHAEL ROMANOV Where is Russia's capital? Moscow? The Kremlin? No, Russia's capital is... (points at mansion) THROUGH THOSE GATES! (crowd CHEERS) A den of thieves! A LIMOUSINE pulls through the crowd, which reluctantly parts. The guards within the compound open the gates. MICHAEL ROMANOV And here - the Prince of Thieves! GREGOR TRETIAK sits in the back of the limousine, silently glaring at Romanov. The limousine rolls inside the compound, the gates CLANGING shut. MICHAEL ROMANOV Every citizen in St. Petersburg knows what that man does, yet the police don't arrest him. They protect him! How can this be? Maybe we should ask our elected whores in Moscow! The CROWD CHEERS WILDLY and starts hurling rocks, bottles, etc, through the gate at -- -- TRETIAK, emerging from the limousine. Tretiak's guards surround him; they move quickly up the mansion's marble steps, dodging the thrown debris. SIRENS WAIL. Four large police vans roar up, the back doors flinging open. ST. PETERSBURG POLICE, in riot gear, deploy from the vans. The police push into the crowd, wielding riot shields and batons. A melee breaks out, Romanov supporters versus the police. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - EVENING Tretiak and his men move past A GUARD STATION manned by TWO GUARDS watching six SURVEILLANCE MONITORS (showing, at all times, certain areas of. the compound). This is a former nobleman's residence; a 20 foot diameter CRYSTAL CHANDELIER hangs from the domed roof fifty feet above. A spectacular staircase ascends to a mezzanine, with offices (formerly bed chambers) off it. Tretiak approaches a man in a lab coat, ZUBOV, wearing a grim, anxious expression. Zubov chainsmokes constantly. ZUBOV There's a problem. Tretiak follows Zubov down stairs into -- INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - BASEMENT LABORATORY -- a large room with TECHNICIANS hunched over computers. Tretiak follows Zubov to a large bank of computers. ZUBOV (indicates computer) This is the data your thief sent us. Tretiak looks at Zubov's COMPUTER SCREEN. INSERT - THE COMPUTER SCREEN. Again we see: THE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION Submitted by: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS BACK TO SCENE TRETIAK (confused) Cold fusion? ZUBOV Yes. Fusion at room temperature. Regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community. A myth. (smiles) Then I read this. Zubov begins scrolling through the document; again we see the displav of graphs. tables. plans. Specs.. etc. ZUBOV She first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak - is impractical. You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy is wasted than created. Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion. (scrolls more pages) The hydrogen isotopes needed. (scrolls more pages) The physical plant. She even estimates its cost. Extraordinary. (scrolls more pages) The next pages are the critical part, what no one in fifty years has discovered. (looks up at Tretiak) The combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature. Tretiak leans toward the screen, waiting. TRETIAK Well? Let's see. ZUBOV Tretiak - I think from reading this that the woman's done it. She may have found a source of unlimited energy. TRETIAK What do you mean may have. Show me. ZUBOV I said there was a problem. Zubov hits the "scroll" key. The next page appears; we see the heading at the top of the page: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION But there's something wrong with the rest of the page. Terribly wrong. We know this because of  TRETIAK'S EXPRESSION, and it's not too happy. TRETIAK Where's the rest of it? ZUBOV It's in her head. and CUT TO: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING JILLIAN, humming the Cole Porter song from the previous evening, fills a basket with breakfast for two: eggs, bagels, etc. Sunlight streams in. Birds chirping. She wears jeans and her jacket with the atomic diagram embroidered on the back. She grabs flowers from a vase; tosses them in the basket. Smiles. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM She enters with the basket. Looks at the disheveled couch and the bottle of Oban. She hums the Cole Porter song, stabs her feet in THE SHOES TEMPLAR GAVE HER and goes to the front door. EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT Jillian comes out, running into -- YURI, her lab assistant, who comes up the front stoop. Mid-20's, heavy Russian accent, white lab coat. YURI Good morning, boss. Where are you going? JILLIAN To see a friend. Be back in a couple hours. She gets in her car. Yuri gives her a look, goes inside. INT. JILL IAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM Yuri enters. The foyer phone RINGS. Yuri answers. YURI Doctor St. Thomas' residence. ILYA (o.s., in Russian) There's been a change of plans. Yuri stares at the phone and -- CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER - TEMPLAR' S MANSION - MORNING The huge estate, as before. Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circular driveway. Jillian gets out with the breakfast basket. Moves up the flagstoned walk. Suddenly the front door opens. A WOMAN, mid-30's, pretty and well-dressed, comes out and locks the door. JILLIAN watches her. The woman comes down the walk. WOMAN May I help you? (beat) Do you have an appointment? JILLIAN A what? WOMAN To see the house. JILLIAN The man who lives here... who owns the house... WOMAN What man. The estate is rented for weddings and corporate events. Are you. ..interested...? JILLIAN No. No. The rental agent gives Jillian a funny look and gets in her car. Drives off. Jillian stares at the house, thunderstruck. Then she sharply inhales: JILLIAN Oh my god. ... Jillian gets in her car. CUT TO: TEMPLAR'S COMPUTER screen, which reads: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* PRIVATE UNMARKED ACCOUNTS PLEASE ENTER SECURITY PASSWORD INT. J.F.K. INT. - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS TEMPLAR sits in the British Air lounge. He has shaved and his eyeglasses are gone; he looks like himself again. In the b.g., businessmen are relaxing, reading newspapers, drinking coffee. Over the intercom: INTERCOM VOICE Varig Air flight 157 to Rio de Janeiro, departing at 8 a.m, boarding now from gate seventeen. Templar checks his wristwatch: It's 7:40 a.m. Templar types in his password and waits. On the screen, this: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* ACCOUNT OF: TEMPLAR, SIMON BALANCE (AS OF 8/15/95): U.S. $57,895,125.12 (the same balance since London). Templar frowns. Something's not right. He hasn't been paid. CUT TO: INT. JILLIAN' SHOUSE - BACK HALLWAY - MORNING Jillian runs down the hall, breath escaping her lungs. JILLIAN The supermarket, the flat tire, all a set-up. You fool. You fool. (calls down the hall) Yuri! She unpockets her keyring, her hands trembling uncontrollably. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - MORNING Jillian races down the stairs and across the lab to her computer. She moves in a panic, as if in a living nightmare. She turns the computer on. She types in the code word, "kamakot," and her research paper appears on the screen. In the lower right corner it reads: LAST ENTERED: 10:23 p.m. JILLIAN No.. . .. She sees something on the desk. The NOTEPAD on which Templar wrote his notes. The page is indented with Templar's pen marks; the words "tokamak" and "kamakot" are clearly visible. JILLIAN No, this can't be happening. Yuri! (turns, calling) YURI! She jumps, startled, because YURI is right behind her. He moves toward her and -- CUT TO: INT. J.F.K. INT. - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS WOMAN (o.s.) Is that a good system? A WOMAN, 40's, dowdy and serious in an accountant-like way, has sat down across from Templar. Points at Templar's computer. TEMPLAR Yes. WOMAN ACCOUNTANT (o.s.) Going to Europe? (Templar ignores her) Uhmm, I'm going for coffee. Like some? It's really no trouble. ... Okay lady, anything to get rid of you: TEMPLAR Sure. Black please. She smiles and walks off to the coffee counter, passing A BUSINESSMAN, who sits down with a steaming cup of coffee and starts reading the WALL STREET JOURNAL. Templar eyes the man, then looks back at his computer. He begins typing. The phone modem engages.  Templar types: LION CONTACTING BEAR. IS BEAR HOME? -- This comes back: AFFIRMATIVE. -- Templar types: LION HAS NOT BEEN PAID. EXPLAIN. -- This comes back: LION'S DATA IS DEFECTIVE. -- Templar types: DEFINE "DEFECTIVE." -- This comes back: LIONS EMPLOYMENT TERMINATED. Templar stares at the screen, his mind racing... THE ACCOUNTANT WOMAN comes back to the table with Templar's coffee. Sets it before him. Smiles. TEMPLAR Thanks. INTERCOM (v.o.) British Air flight 74 to London now boarding from gate fifteen. I repeat, British Air Flight 74... The Woman Accountant rises, picks up her bag. WOMAN ACCOUNTANT Well, that's me. So long. She smiles. Templar sort of smiles back. She walks off to catch her flight. THE BUSINESSMAN next to Templar, hidden behind his newspaper, sets his coffee cup down next to Templar's. The Businessman flips a page, engrossed in an article. He reaches back for his coffee, but takes Templar's cup. He drinks from the cup. TEMPLAR Excuse me, that's my. . . . The Businessman's newspaper is shaking. Violently. It falls to the table. The Businessman's face is flushed. He twitches. He pitches over. His head THUDS on the table. Templar feels the Businessman's carotid artery. He's dead. Templar picks up his coffee and smells it. Templar's eyes dart to the lounge. The Lady Accountant is gone. Nobody in the lounge has noticed what's happened. Templar hurriedly collects his things. CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER - JILLIAN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY AN AIRPORT TAXI stops at the curb. Templar gets out, paying the cabbie. The taxi pulls away. Templar approaches the house, eyes darting. He moves toward the door, unpocketing his 9mm pistol. He checks the doorknob, turning it. It's open. ... INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - DAY Templar enters. No one is here. He moves through the living room into the back corridor, glancing into the kitchen, where we see that -- INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY -- SOMEONE is behind the refrigerator, holding a SILENCED GUN in a blackgloved hand. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY Templar moves through the hall, looking in each door. He comes to the lab staircase. The door is open. Templar heads down the stairs. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - DAY Templar comes down; he walks to the computer. He looks at the document on the screen. He begins scrolling, going to the end this time. We see the graphs, tables, plans, specs., etc. Then the critical page appears: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION And under that. . . .. A NINTENDO GAME. Little spaceships are flying around chasing other little spaceships! TEMPLAR stares at it, stunned: what he sent the Russians is essentially worthless. Templar shuts off the monitor. The screen blackens. The black screen reflects light. It reflects A PERSON coming down the stairs. A person with a gun... Templar dives away as THREE BULLETS blow the computer monitor to shards. THE WOMAN FROM THE J.F.K. LOUNGE, not an accountant but an assassin, draws a bead on -- TEMPLAR, who scrambles across the room ducking under lab tables as BULLETS shatter bottles, beakers, test tubes; glass fills the air. TEMPLAR stands up, his 9mm leveled at the woman. The woman's gun is leveled at Templar. - TEMPLAR That's a Reuger nine shot. I counted nine. FEMALE ASSASSIN What if you're wrong. The tension boils. Templar was right: her hand flashes to the gun, ejecting the spent clip. She tries to ram in a fresh clip but she's not fast enough... TEMPLAR'S across the room in half a second. He presses his gun to her forehead. TEMPLAR When were you hired and for what? I'm not in a very good mood... Templar cocks the hammer. This gets her attention. FEMALE ASSASSIN Okay. Take it easy. I was hired a week ago to take you and the woman out, and detonate the house. It was empty when I got here. TEMPLAR Who's your employer? FEMALE ASSASSIN I don't ask names. TEMPLAR Did they have accents? Russian? (she nods; he lowers his gun) I'm paying you out of your contract. Don't ask questions. What's your price? FEMALE ASSASSIN Fifty thousand for you, fifty for her, fifty for the house. Templar pulls out his wallet, from which he unfolds three pieces of negotiable paper. Hands them to her. She examines them. TEMPLAR U.S. bearer bonds. Good as cash. FEMALE ASSASSIN About the airport - no offense you understand. TEMPLAR None taken. Go and don't come back. And she turns and walks off. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM Templar enters, looking around, thinking. He looks in the bathroom. He looks in the closet. On the floor are Jillian's footwear: sneakers, pumps, cowboy boots, etc. Right, Templar, the shoes... TEMPLAR pulls out his HOMING DEVICE and clicks it on. INSERT - HOMING DEVICE SCREEN Like before, an electronic rendering of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. But no pulsing light. Templar enters commands, adjusting the screen, widening it to GREATER NEW YORK. Somewhere in Queens, fairly close to the Atlantic Ocean, we see a PULSING LIGHT. But it's fixed, inert. The pulsing light begins to move east, quickly. Templar watches it. The pulse is moving too quickly for an automobile. And it's heading for the ocean. And it goes in the ocean! TEMPLAR (dawning on him) A. . . .plane. Indeed, Simon Templar, a plane. CUT TO: INT. PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT OVER ATLANTIC A mid-sized gulfstream. JILLIAN sits in a wheelchair, covered with a blanket. She stirs. Mumbles something. Slowly opens her eyes. Yuri approaches. Yuri lifts away the blanket. Jillian's wrists are tied to the wheelchair armrests, her ankles to the footrests. Yuri produces a SYRINGE. He grabs Jillian's forearm and pushes in the needle. Jillian's head bobs forward. CUT TO: INT. J. F. K. INTERNATIONAL - CONCOURSE Templar hurries through the concourse with his carry-on bags, taking a left, moving past sign: AIR FRANCE CONCORDE - - - - > INT. J.F.K. - "AIR FRANCE" - CONCORDE TERMINAL The passengers are in a line, going through security. Templar walks up next to A GUY IN A BROOKS BROTHERS SUIT. Stares at him. After a few seconds of this... BROOKS BROTHERS MAN Can I help you with something? TEMPLAR Your ticket. What'd you pay for it? BROOKS BROTHERS MAN What? TEMPLAR I'll give you twenty grand for it. Cash. Right now. (they stop) I need to get on that plane. BROOKS BROTHERS MAN Very badly obviously. (studies Templar) Fifty thousand and it's yours. Templar rolls his eyes but the guy is unmoved. Templar scowls and pulls out his bearer bonds... CUT TO: INT. MARSEILLES - AIRPLANE HANGAR - CONTINUOUS A hangar at Marseilles' Marignane Airport. A MAN is sprawled inside the engine cowling of a WWI classic BIWING FIGHTER. We only see his legs. VOICE Remy! Telephone. REMY (IN ENGINE COWLING) Oui. Un moment. REMY SAMARKAND, 40's, Algerian, pulls himself up and sits on the engine cowling. Bandanna around neck. Cigar. A tattoo here, a scar there... COCO, a young mechanic, hands Remy a CELLULAR PHONE. REMY SAMARKAND Merci, Coco. (Coco walks off) Remy Samarkand Aeronautique, Remy Samarkand. TEMPLAR (v.o.) I need a favour, Remy. REMY SAMARKAND (smiles) Anything for Simon Templar... CUT TO: EXT. PARIS, FRANCE - CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - THREE HOURS LATER The Concorde touches down as we SUPER: CHARLES DE GAULLE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, PARIS, FRANCE EXT. DE GAULLE AIRPORT - TARMAC Templar, with his carry-on bags, and Remy Samarkand run across the tarmac toward a LEAR JET being fueled. In the b.g. sits the huge Concorde jet. They yell over the howling jet engines. TEMPLAR IT'S A LITTLE JET, MAYBE A TURBO PROP. ENTERED SCOTLAND FIVE MINUTES AGO, GO ING TO ST. PETERSBURG. CAN WE GET TO IT BEFORE THEN? REMY SAMARKAND OUI . OVER FINLAND. INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - MINUTES LATER THE HOMING DEVICE - The screen shows a MAP OF EUROPE. Two locations are pulsing: 1) Remy's jet, moving north from Paris; and 2) The jet carrying Jillian, moving across Scotland heading due east. The plane is in flight. Templar's homing device and mini-computer sit on the cockpit console. TEMPLAR What are you smuggling these days? REMY SAMARKAND Oh, things. How long has it been  two year? Three? Now tell me: what's so important about this plane? TEMPLAR Fifteen million dollars of my money. (picks up cellular phone) And a score to settle. Templar punches numbers and CUT TO: EXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY The city's decrepid industrial section. PANNING PAST buildings we come to the facade of "APEX ELECTRONICS," the only well-maintained building on the block. A throbbing drum-beat is heard within... INT. EAST BERLIN - APEX ELECTRONI CS - DAY Organized. Spotless. You could eat off the floor. A STEREO plays GERMAN TECHNO-ROCK at a zillion decibals. A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE hangs from a hoist. BERTA FRANK (hereafter "FRANKIE), late 20's, blonde spiky hair, pretty in a sort of dangerous way, is soldering a panel of transistors to the satellite. A wall-mounted T.V. plays a news program. GERMAN NEWS ANCHOR (German) In Russia, Michael Romanov has been accused of inciting riots and violence in St. Petersburg... The phone RINGS. Frankie grabs it. FRANKIE Ja. TEMPLAR (v.o.) How's the weather in Berlin, Frankie? FRANKIE Simon? Where are you? INTERCUT - SIMON IN REMY' S PLANE / FRANKIE IN BERLIN TEMPLAR Unimportant. How soon can you be in St. Petersburg? Frankie looks at her wristwatch. FRANKIE Five hours. What type of job? TEMPLAR Eyes and ears. Two hundred thousand cash for two days work. FRANKIE Who's the mark? TEMPLAR Gregor Tretiak. His headquarters. His office in particular. Frankie lights a cigarette. Thinks. FRANKIE Gregor Tretiak is not a very nice man, Simon. Four hundred thousand. TEMPLAR Deal. Now listen, Frankie... DISSOLVE TO: INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY Four hours later. Jillian sits, head bowed, unconscious. Yuri sits opposite. He is nodding off. If only Jillian could wake up... The PILOT shouts back. PILOT We're over Helsinki. Yuri wakes, sits upright. Yawns. INT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY Remy's peering out the window. Sees something. REMY SAMARKAND Simon, there! Two miles ahead, THE RUSSIAN JET roars past, heading east toward St. Petersburg. Remy jerks the stick, banking into a right turn behind the Russian jet. Remy looks at his ALTITUDE GAUGE. REMY SAMARKAND They're descending. Remy looks at Templar; Templar nods back. Remy pushes the stick; the Lear jet begins descending. INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY Jillian sits, still unconscious. Or is she? JILLIAN' S POV - THROUGH SLITTED EYES Through the tiniest slit of eye, so as not to appear conscious, Jillian looks at Yuri, then at TWO PARACHUTES shelved above the emergency exit. BACK TO SCENE - YURI stands up and stretches. He goes to the window and looks out. [Wheelchair trivia: wheelchair armrests are removable, enabling a patient to transfer himself from the chair to a regular chair, or car seat, etc...] JILLIAN'S RIGHT HAND (photographed in extreme close-up under the blanket) pulls out the PIN securing the armrest to the wheelchair. She lifts the armrest, separating the aluminum tubing, freeing her right wrist. INT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY Through the windshield is the RUSSIAN GULF STREAM. Remy, his headset on, turns to Templar. REMY The St. Petersburg tower wants us to circle. TEMPLAR No. Follow them down. REMY What do we do when we land? TEMPLAR Haven't figured that out yet. INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY The aircraft is tilted forward in descent. The PILOT shouts back to Yuri: PILOT (Russian, subtitled) Prepare for landing. The Pilot shuts the cockpit door. Suddenly JILLIAN'S EYES are open; her hands are free and she's throwing off the blanket and gripping the wheels. She pushes; the wheelchair bursts forward. YURI gets to his feet; the wheelchair slams against his shins. Jillian WHIPS the detached armrest across Yuri's head. Yuri falls backward, dazed. Jillian rolls to the emergency door, one hand yanking open the door, the other grabbing a PARACHUTE from the shelf. Wind howls through the cabin. Jillian gets the parachute on. Her ankles are still bound to the footrests. To hell with it, she'll lose the wheelchair in mid-air. She pushes forward as -- -- YURI lunges across the floor, grabbing the wheels. JILLIAN AND THE CHAIR teeter on the edge of emergency door exit, half in, half out. Yuri clings to the chair wheels. His body jerks forward. He's sliding on his stomach. Jillian and the chair are pulling him out. Terror in Yuri's eyes. He grabs for the door frame. His fingers slip. Jillian, the wheelchair, and Yuri hanging from the wheelchair, plunge from the aircraft. INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY Templar's bagging his computer and homing device. REMY suddenly clutches his arm. REMY Simon. Templar looks up. TEMPLAR' S /REMY' S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD JILLIAN AND YURI fall from the aircraft. INT . THE RUSS IAN GULFSTREAM The pilot, looking down at Jillian and Yuri, clicks on his short-wave radio: PILOT We have a problem. EXT. SKIES OVER ST. PETERSBURG - DAY JILLIAN freefalls in the wheelchair, her ankles still bound to the chair's footrests. YURI is beneath her, clutching the wheels. He tries to pull himself up. JILLIAN yanks the rip-cord; a plume of silk spills out and Jillian and the chair SLINGSHOT UP, decelerating from 120 m.p.h. to 20 m.p.h. in two seconds. Yuri can't take the "G" force; his hands rip away from the chair. He plummets, SCREAMING, and 3000 feet later he will hit concrete in St. Petersburg. Jillian pulls out the footrest pins (the footrests separate from the chair in the same manner), freeing her ankles. The chair releases, falling away. INT. REMY' S JET - CONTINUOUS Templar turns to the cockpit storage hatches behind him. He yanks open one designated: PARACHUTES. REMY SAMARKAND Don't! TWO HUGE TOUCANS fly out of the hatch. They flap around the cockpit. Templar looks askance at Remy... TEMPLAR Remy... REMY SAMARKAND I get ten grand for them in Paris. Maybe a Russian would pay more? Templar grabs a PARACHUTE PACK and races to the back of the plane. He YANKS OPEN the EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR. Cold air blasts his face. TEMPLAR Put down in Helsinki and wait for my call! And Templar jumps and -- CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS An autumn day in Peter the Great's city. Peaceful. Normal. Pedestrians walk the streets. [note: St. Petersburg is called "Venice of the North" because it's built atop marshy islands connected by canals. There are over 400 bridges; on the canals, boat traffic is often as dense as automobile traffic.] A WOMAN, glancing up, notices something. WOMAN (Russian) Look. (points skyward) Look! Other pedestrians stop. They, too, look up at -- A PARACHUTIST (Jillian of course) descending into the heart of the city! And down she comes, landing hard in the middle of an intersection. TAXIS and AUTOMOBILES swerve aside, nearly killing her. Others SCREECH to a stop. JILLIAN gets to her feet, wild-eyed and frantic, tangled in cord and parachute silk. She looks around at -- CROWDS OF PEDESTRIANS staring at her. JILLIAN Help me. I'm American. Police! A ST. PETERSBURG POLICE CRUISER comes through the intersection to a stop. A YOUNG COP, just 20, hangs up his c.b. radio and gets out. He approaches Jillian. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - PETER AND PAUL FORTRESS CITY PARK Across the Neva River from Jillian is a city park with a HUGE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF PETER THE GREAT. Under the statue, two OLD RUSSIAN GEEZERS are playing chess, smoking pipes, arguing, etc. Down TEMPLAR comes. The parachute snags on the BRONZE HORSE'S HEAD. Templar dangles 15 feet off the ground. He looks at the GEEZERS directly below. Hello there. TEMPLAR Sorry about this. He shrugs off the parachute pack and falls, landing on the chess board, scuttling the pieces. The Geezers fall backward on their behinds. Templar gets to his feet, gaining his bearings, looking for Jillian. He takes off running. INT. POLICE SEDAN, DRIVING - CONTINUOUS - DAY Jillian sits in the back seat, catching her breath. The Young Cop looks at her in the rear-view mirror. JILLIAN Do you speak English? YOUNG RUSSIAN COP Yes. Some. JILLIAN Thank God. (takes a deep breath, composes herself) I'm an American scientist. Last night, in New York, a man stole something from me, then this morning I was kidnapped by my lab assistant, god this sounds like a bad novel . . . . . Suddenly a ROCK bounces off the windshield. JILLIAN What was that? EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - DAY The police cruiser moves past A THRONG OF MICHAEL ROMANOV SUPPORTERS carrying placards and banners. They begin pelting the cruiser with rocks and bottles. INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY The cruiser clears the Romanov supporters. Rocks and bottles smash on the back windshield. YOUNG RUSSIAN COP There could be revolution maybe. City very dangerous. IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD - TWO OTHER POLICE CRUISERS pull into the street, blocking it. The Young Russian Cop brakes; the cruiser comes to a stop in front of the other cruisers. An OLDER RUSSIAN COP, followed by a PLAINCLOTHESMAN, approach the young cop's cruiser. EXT. TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY TEMPLAR sprints across the Neva River Bridge connecting the Peter and Paul Park with downtown St. Petersburg. He suddenly stops short, seeing -- TEMPLAR' S POV - TWO BLOCKS AWAY -- JILLIAN in the cruiser, the Older Cop and the plainclothesman approaching. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - INTERSECTION - DAY The Older Cop leans in the window. OLDER COP (Russian) Is this her? YOUNG COP (Russian) Yes sir Sergeant Ravik. The plainclothesman emerges from behind the Older Cop. In one shocking, effortless motion, he places a silenced handgun to the Young Cop's head and squeezes the trigger. Blood spatters the windshield. JILLIAN gasps in horror at the plainclothesman. It is...ILYA. The Older Cop opens the door, shoving the Young Cop's corpse to the passenger side. Ilya gets in back next to Jillian, pressing the HANDGUN into her ribs. The cruiser ROARS off into St. Petersburg traffic. EXT. AT THE FOOT OF TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS TEMPLAR looks around. He sees A MOTORCYCLE STAND filled with MOTORCYCLES. Runs to it. Chooses a big, powerful, Honda street machine. He pulls out his burglar's tools; jams one in the ignition. He has it running in seconds. He throws it in gear and ROARS off. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - CONTINUOUS - DAY Templar blasts through traffic on the Honda. He's on a street parallel to Jillian's. AT AN INTERSECTION Templar looks to his right, where he can see, one block over on the parallel street -- THE POLICE CRUISER moving through traffic. Templar guns the motorcycle. The engine WHINES. He races ahead, accelerating through the gears. AT THE NEXT INTERSECTION - TEMPLAR throws the cycle into a skidding, hair-raising turn. He's going 'round the block to cut off the sedan. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - DAY The police cruiser moves through the intersection. Suddenly TEMPLAR'S MOTORCYCLE, Templar-less, veers into the path of the cruiser. The cruiser hits it head on. The motorcycle rides up the cruiser's hood and smashes through the front windshield. The cruiser careens out of control. It fishtails twice and crashes into A STREETLIGHT POLE. INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - DAY UP FRONT, the Older Cop is unconscious; he's taken the full brunt of the motorcycle through the windshield. IN THE BACK, Ilya is groggy, semi-conscious. JILLIAN is reeling also; there's a gash on her forehead. The BACK PASSENGER DOOR jerks open. TEMPLAR lunges inside. Ilya raises his gun but he's weak, disoriented. Templar yanks it from his hand and pistol whips him. This has all happened so fast. Jillian looks at Ilya then at Templar... JILLIAN What...? WHO...? And Templar yanks Jillian out. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS - DAY The intersection is chaos: PEDESTRIANS running up, surrounding the police cruiser, vehicles stopping, etc. Templar, virtually dragging Jillian, plows through the crowd, passing a Russian Army Corporal who's just gotten out of his ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK. RUSSIAN ARMY CORPORAL (Russian) Let me help! TEMPLAR (Russian) (pointing back at the police sedan) Help them! The Corporal runs to the smashed cruiser, and -- TEMPLAR and JILLIAN run to the Corporal's SUPPLY TRUCK. INT. RUSSIAN ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK - DAY The driver's side door opens. In comes Jillian, then Templar. Templar shoves Jillian across the front seat and gets in, behind the wheel. He floors it. They accelerate into traffic. Templar looks at Jillian. She's trembling, staring catatonically straight ahead. JILLIAN Who are you. Tell me who you are and what the hell is going on. TEMPLAR I was hired to steal your research, but you know that by now. You left the critical data off the disk. Where is it? memorized, right? (she doesn't answer) That's a bad cut. Here. He hands her his HANDKERCHIEF. She swats it away. TEMPLAR Look, you're in big trouble. The guy who hired me will do anything to get your research. Once he has it, you're a corpse. Give me the missing data and I'll get you out of here. You can trust me. She stares at him in disbelief. JILLIAN Trust you? (chews the word) Trust you...? She grabs the door handle and yanks it open. Templar grabs her arm, pulling her back. They wrestle back and forth... TEMPLAR Damn it, don't be stupid...! She picks up the CORPORAL'S STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE, sitting in a holder on the console between them, and throws it in Templar's face. TEMPLAR ARGGH! Templar recoils, blinded, releasing Jillian. He jerks the steering wheel to the side and stomps on the brakes. JILLIAN lunges out before the supply truck fully stops. She hits the pavement running. She hurries off, blending into the crowded sidewalk. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS Templar gets out, cursing, wiping the hot liquid from his eyes. He looks around. Runs off in Jillian's direction, abandoning the supply truck. CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - LOMONOSOVA AVENUE Templar, running, out of breath, rounds a corner onto Lomonosova Avenue, in the city's shopping district. It's jammed with PEDESTRIANS, SHOPPERS, MERCHANTS, etc. Templar moves through the crowd, eyes scanning left and right. There's no sign of Jillian. Then he sees her. Just a glimpse. 50 yards ahead. Moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the FONTANKA (the largest and most beautiful of the city's grand canals). EXT. LOMONOSOVA AVENUE - FONTANKA CANAL BRIDGE - SUNSET Templar runs over the Fontanka Canal Bridge. Nothing. He comes back the other way. Nothing. He stops in the middle of the bridge, exhausted, out of breath. Below him, passing under the bridge, all types of WATER CONVEYANCES (skiffs, barges, dinghies, etc) are navigating the canal. And emerging from underneath the bridge, seated in the back of a WATER TAXI,...is Jillian. Templar races off the bridge. EXT. FONTANKA CANAL - EMBANKMENT PROMENADE - SUNSET Templar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal. The water taxi is 50 yards past the bridge. JILLIAN sees him coming. TEMPLAR closes the gap. 30 yards. 20 yards. Now 10. Now he's running alongside the taxi, staring at Jillian. And she stares back at him, stony, expressionless. The canal is wider now, and the water taxi accelerates, pulling away from the slower skiffs. Templar slows to a jog. He stops, lungs heaving. The sun is setting to the west. The water taxi speeds off into the setting sun, leaving Templar with this image of Jillian: eyes unblinking, staring at him with pure, unadulterated hatred. CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT Night is falling. Down the street from Tretiak's headquarters, A FEDERAL EXPRESS VAN rolls up to a traffic light. INT. FEDERAL EXPRESS VAN - NIGHT FRANKIE has arrived in St. Petersburg. She sits at the wheel in a Federal Express uniform. She pulls out a charge of C-4 plastique with a timer. She opens the van door; tosses it into a sidewalk TRASH RECEPTACLE. She accelerates through the light, now green, and takes a left into TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS, parking behind a LIMOUSINE which has just entered. The limousine's doors open. Several dark-suited men get out. One of them is IVAN GRACHA (the Russian mafia figure shown on the C.N.N. broadcast). INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE - NIGHT A MAP OF ST. PETERSBURG AND OUTLYING REGIONS is spread out on Tretiak's desk. Tretiak, Ilya, Zubov, and ten men are present. ILYA There could be another solution. The woman is not-the only scientist working in this field. Is she? Tretiak turns to Zubov, who nods. ZUBOV No. There are others. TRETIAK Get on a plane. Leave tonight. The door opens. Zero, the huge bodyguard, enters. ZERO Gracha is here. Tretiak goes immediately to his desk, pressing the "RECORD" BUTTON on a v.c.r. within. The surveillance camera in Tretiak's office begins taping the meeting. IVAN GRACHA and six bodyguards enter. GRACHA This had better be important. It's my wife's birthday. TRETIAK My apologies to your wife. GRACHA An apology from Tretiak? An historic moment. TRETIAK (placating) Come now, Ivan, why must we feud. GRACHA We feud because we hate each other. TRETIAK It is true there have been harsh words between us. We are rivals. But rivalry is bad for business. Upon what conditions would you accept a partnership? Be reasonable. GRACHA Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. TRETIAK Agreed. (they shake hands) I need the men in your areas, Ivan, for two days. Particularly Moscow and points South. GRACHA Why? Tretiak hands TWO PHOTOGRAPHS to Gracha. One is of JILLIAN, taken somewhere in Westchester, wearing her "atomic" jacket. The second is an Interpol photo taken of TEMPLAR in a cafe in Amsterdam. TRETIAK To find this woman... and kill this man. GRACHA (smiles) This is a private matter, I take it. (Tretiak smiles) Then you'll have them. TRETIAK Ilya - some wine for Ivan Gracha. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NI GHT TWO GUARDS man the guard station, eyeing the bank of six video monitors. Frankie enters with a big DELIVERY BOX. FRANKIE (Russian) Delivery. Frankie hands Guard 1 the box and hands Guard 2 a clipboard for his signature. Frankie looks at the surveillance monitors and raises an eyebrow. ON TRETIAK'S OFFICE MONITOR - we see Tretiak with Ivan Gracha raising a toast. In the screen's lower corner are the letters "REC." The meeting is being taped. EXT. NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT. THE C-4 in the trash receptacle blows. It blows up TWO CARS and A TREE. A monstrously concussive explosion. INT. TRETIAK' S OFFI CE Gracha drops his wine glass; it shatters on the floor. Gracha and his men unholster their weapons. Tretiak's men go for theirs. A tense stand-off. GRACHA What is this, Tretiak? TRETIAK Put your guns down. Tretiak goes to his desk; stabs an intercom button -- INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT The guards, save one, barge out the front door. The remaining guard answers the intercom, leaving FRANKIE unattended by the surveillance monitors. Her hand moves to THE CO-AXIAL CABLE behind the video monitors, yanking it. She plugs a TRANSMITTOR into the monitor, then replugs the co-axial cable into the transmitter. The guard turns to Frankie. FRANKIE What was that? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREET - NIGHT TEMPLAR stands in a shop doorway. He pulls out his homing device. Adjusts the screen. INSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE The computerized screen now shows the ST. PETERSBURG CITY GRID. Two pulses: 1) a fixed pulse (Templar) and 2) a moving pulse (Jillian) on the other side of town. Templar turns his collar up; walks off into the night. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS - NIGHT TEMPLAR comes down a street in a scummy part of town. A GUY in a doorway swigs a vodka bottle, looking dangerously at Templar. A few PROSTITUTES pass. Templar pulls out the homing device. INSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE - The MOVING PULSE is one block from Templar, emanating from inside a huge building, the NEVSKY RAIL STATION. BACK TO SCENE - Templar pockets the homing device and walks across the street to the train station. INT. NEVSKY STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE - NIGHT An enormous facility, 100 yards long with a vaulted ceiling and entrances at the north and south ends. Templar-enters from the north, looking around. He walks quickly to the center of the station concourse. STATION LOUDSPEAKER (v.o.) Next train to Moscow boarding on platform 8. Templar approaches Platform 8. Passengers are boarding the next train to Moscow. Against the wall, a gang of ten PROSTITUTES are smoking, drinking vodka, laughing. Templar freezes. JILLIAN is with the prostitutes. Her back's to Templar, but it's her. Same "atomic" jacket, the shoes Templar gave her, same height, same weight. ... Templar isn't the only one who's spotted her... TWO MEN IN BLACK TRENCHCOATS, obviously Tretiak's men, are converging upon Jillian from the other direction. They haven't yet seen Templar... Templar moves off quickly, drawing his gun. As Tretiak's men move in for the kill. TEMPLAR falls in behind them, WHIPPING the barrel of his gun over one, then the other. They fall, unconscious. The PROSTITUTES, alarmed, whirl around and... ...It's not Jillian. Templar, thunderstruck, looks at THE PROSTITUTE'S feet. She's wearing JILLIAN'S SHOES and JACKET. On her wrist is JILLIAN'S WRISTWATCH. Templar turns. The TRAIN TO MOSCOW is pulling out of the station. ... Templar sprints away, back toward the station concourse. It's all clear now; Jillian sold her clothes and watch and bought a ticket to Moscow. EXT. NEVSKY STATION - NIGHT AUTOMOBILES are parked in front of the station. Templar picks a B.M.W. out come the burglar's tools. Templar's through the door lock in two seconds. He gets in and shoves a tool in the ignition lock. CUT TO: INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN B.M.W. - NIGHT Templar speeds down the highway, moving in and out of traffic. His cellular phone chirps. He unpockets it, clicks it on. FRANKIE Simon. Good news. INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT In the b.g. through a window, we see Tretiak's headquarters looming down the street. Frankie sits in front of six VIDEO MONITORS like those in Tretiak's headquarters; they are receiving the video transmissions from Tretiak's surveillance cameras. We see exteriors, Zubov's lab, corridors, etc. Frankie is looking at A MONITOR OF TRETIAK'S OFFICE; Tretiak is pacing, talking on the phone. FRANKIE They haven't found her and they don't know where she is. INTERCUT - FRANKIE IN HOTEL/TEMPLAR DRIVING TEMPLAR She's on a train to Moscow. FRANKIE That's bad news. They're 'stopping every train leaving the city. TEMPLAR Call you later, Frankie. Templar tosses the phone and jerks the wheel. The B.M.W. veers wildly across three lanes of traffic, swerving off the highway down an exit ramp. CUT TO: EXT. ROAD SOUTH OF ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT The St. Petersburg city outskirts. Templar's B.M.W. rounds a corner onto a two-lane road running next to the Moscow line train tracks. INT. TEMPLAR'S B.M.W - NIGHT Templar stares ahead through the windshield. TEMPLAR'S POV - THE TRAIN TRACKS - A half mile ahead is a street crossing. We see the blinking caboose lights of the TRAIN TO MOSCOW. It's stopped at an intersection in front of TWO BLACK SEDANS parked across the tracks. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - NIGHT JILLIAN sits alone, looking around nervously, wondering why the hell the train's stopped. Her hair is brushed over the gash on her forehead. She wears the prostitute's ratty jacket and shoes. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS Two of Tretiak's men enter the first passenger car, heads swiveling back and forth, checking every passenger's face. EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT Templar runs up to the rear passenger car. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT Tretiak's men come through the third car. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CARS - NIGHT Templar comes the other way looking for Jillian. Through one car and into the next. He sees JILLIAN. This time it is her. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT On come Tretiak's men, into another car. They're one car away now... INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - JILLIAN'S CAR JILLIAN sits up in her seat; she looks through the connecting door into the next car, which TRETIAK'S MEN are entering. She rises to flee, running into -- -- TEMPLAR. Jillian's eyes bulge. She's going to scream. Templar clamps her mouth and shoves her forward to the exit door which opens to the parallel tracks. Templar wrenches open the door and sticks his head outside, looking down the tracks. We hear a TRAIN WHISTLE and RUMBLING WHEELS. Templar comes back inside. TRETIAK'S MEN are half-way through the next car and approaching fast. TEMPLAR We're going to jump. Okay? Jillian, terrified, wide-eyed, nods. And they jump. EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS Templar and Jillian lunge from the train onto the parallel tracks. A train whistle BLARES. Jillian looks up; her face contorts with shock at -- A TRAIN bearing down on them at 60 m.p.h. 100 feet. Now 70. 50. Jesus, it's right on top of them... TEMPLAR grabs her hand and yanks her across the tracks with 10 feet to go. The TRAIN SCREAMS past them. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - DAY TRETIAK'S MEN enter the car where Jillian was. Outside, the St. Petersburg train flashes by, blocking any view of Templar and Jillian on the other side of the tracks. They continue down the aisle, into the next car. EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS The train to St. Petersburg is gone. Jillian stares at Templar with hateful eyes. He gets up and yanks her to her feet. Pulls her back toward the train to Moscow. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT A GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is having a heated conversation on a cellular phone. Outside, we see TRETIAK'S MEN walking toward their vehicles. Templar and Jillian enter the private berth across from the businessman. It has reclining chairs and a curtain for privacy. The train BEGINS MOVING again. Templar and Jillian sit, regarding each other. TEMPLAR You can't get rid of me. JILLIAN Like a bad flu. TEMPLAR Pretty smart, selling the clothes and watch. You were going for the U.S. embassy, weren't you? JILLIAN Present tense please  I am going. Before we discuss the present, let's discuss the past. She stares hard, malevolently at him. JILLIAN Who the hell are you. I want full name, address, profession, and don't - don't - say Michael Quinn of 112 Mason Street, shoemaker. TEMPLAR My name is Simon Templar. I don't have an address because I live in hotels. I'm a professional thief. JILLIAN Good. We're getting somewhere. I'd like to respond to that. The German Businessman is looking at them. Jillian pulls the curtain shut. Then she SLAPS Templar, hard, across the face. JILLIAN You wicked man. (slaps him again. You liar. (slaps him again) Thief. She draws back to slap him again. He catches her arm. They freeze this way, faces inches apart. She's trembling, her face a mask of hatred. JILLIAN I hope you rot in hell. He lets go of her. She stands up. TEMPLAR Where are you going? JILLIAN As far away from you as I can. Templar pulls out his 9mm pistol. TEMPLAR Sit down. Jillian stares at the gun. JILLIAN You're joking. TEMPLAR Michael Quinn jokes. I don't. She glares at him. Slowly sits. Templar pulls out his cellular phone. Punches numbers. TEMPLAR Remy. Be at Moscow Airport at eight a.m., fueled and ready to go. Templar clicks off the phone and pockets it. Then he pockets the gun, its barrel pointing at Jillian through his jacket. With his free hand he grabs her arm and puts it under his arm, clamping it to his body. TEMPLAR We're going to sit here and not make a scene. I'd get some rest. Templar leans back, shutting his eyes. TEMPLAR I sleep light. Jillian, out of the corner of her eye, notices something through the curtain... ACROSS THE AISLE - THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is folding up his cellular phone and stuffing it in his satchel briefcase on the floor. He leans back and closes his eyes. The satchel briefcase sticks into the aisle. Close enough for Jillian to touch... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BENARES, INDIA - ESTABLISHING - MORNING The exquisite, astonishing city on the Ganges River. EXT. BENARES - UNIVERSITY OF BENARES A courtyard in the traditional Indian style. Zubov and two of Tretiak's men approach a building. Zubov rings the doorbell. Seconds pass. The door opens. An Indian gentleman peers out. He's about 50, in a madras shirt and nehru jacket. This is DR. VIJAY SINGH, whose taped lecture we heard in Jillian's station wagon. ZUBOV Dr. Singh? Dr. Vijay Singh? VIJAY SINGH Who are you and what do you want? ZUBOV My name is Vapin Zubov. I would like to discuss something with... VIJAY SINGH (scowls) Come back at a decent hour... Dr. Singh begins to shut the door. Zubov puts his hand in the door, jamming it. ZUBOV I would like to discuss cold fusion, Doctor. Dr. Singh's demeanor changes. Pushes open the door. VIJAY SINGH Come in. CUT TO: INT. THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING PASSENGERS are yawning, pulling up their window blinds. Sunlight streams in. A PORTER passes by. . PORTER Thirty minutes to Moscow, thirty minutes... The Porter moves past the German Businessman; he's asleep and snoring. Across the aisle -- JILLIAN'S EYES are darting from the German Businessman, to TEMPLAR, who's looking out the window. JILLIAN I need to use the ladies' room. I think you can trust me to... TEMPLAR I don't trust anybody. Jillian gives Templar a disgusted look. She rises and moves into the aisle. Ternplar follows. JILLIAN Tell me something. How much were you paid? TEMPLAR It's not your business. Move. JILLIAN I think it is. C'mon. Tell me. TEMPLAR Fifteen million dollars, but it didn't work out. Did it. They pass a PORTER serving snacks (fruits and cheeses) from a cart. Jillian looks' at the cart. JILLIAN Does it bother you? What you do? TEMPLAR No. JILLIAN You have no conscience? No sense of morality? TEMPLAR Define morality. JILLIAN It's a commonly used and generally understood word. TEMPLAR Not by me. . They've arrived outside the LADIES ROOM. Jillian opens the door, begins to enter. TEMPLAR Wait. JILLIAN You are not going in there with me. Templar brushes past her, leaving the door open. He steps up on the toilet, examining the WINDOW above. JILLIAN Okay, how about: Do unto others as they would do unto you. TEMPLAR How about: Do unto others before they do unto you. Templar pulls up the window. It opens only five inches; it's prevented from rising further by TWO SAFETY SCREWS drilled through the frame. JILLIAN How about: love thy neighbor. TEMPLAR The man who said that was crucified by his. Satisfied, Templar steps down and walks back to Jillian. She shakes her head, laughs mirthlessly. JILLIAN Were you raised by wolves? Who were your parents, Lucretia Borgia and the Marquis de Sader TEMPLAR The two people in question weren't as nice as that. I wouldn't know. I never met them. Are you through? It's all yours. She gives him a look and shoves past him into -- THE LADIES ROOM Jillian enters, closes the door and locks it. She stands on the toilet and examines the window. Sees the safety screws. She steps down. She turns on the sink, then kneels and pulls up her pantleg, revealing THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN'S CELLULAR PHONE stuffed in her sock. She pulls it out. She turns the sink on full blast, creating as much noise as she can, and punches numbers. JILLIAN International operator please. (pause) The American Embassy in Moscow, please. Jillian waits for the call to connect and CUT TO: INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CAR - AISLES Jillian exits the ladies' room. JILLIAN You really will rot in hell, know that? TEMPLAR Good, all my friends will be waiting for me. They move down the aisle, passing the SERVING PORTER, Jillian's hand dangles over the fruit and cheese cart. She plucks up a SERVING KNIFE with two fingers and slides it up her sleeve. JILLIAN Friends? I thought you trusted no one. TEMPLAR I don't. Give it to me. JILLIAN (innocently) What. TEMPLAR The knife you just took. Jillian sighs. Pulls the serving knife out of her sleeve and hands it over. When she turns back toward her berth, she doesn't like what she sees -- THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN has woken up. He's yawning, opening up a stack of business correspondence sitting on the armrest of his chair with a LETTER OPENER. JILLIAN continues down the aisle, sweating it out. If the guy discovers that his phone is missing... Each step is a mile. Finally Jillian and Templar come to their berth. The German Businessman is reading a letter. The letter opener is sitting on the stack of unopened letters. Jillian "accidentally" knocks the stack of letters and letter opener off the armrest. They fall to the floor next to the German Businessman's satchel briefcase. Jillian quickly drops to a kneeling position and begins gathering up all the letters. JILLIAN I'm so sorry! As Jillian rises and hands the German Businessman his letters, we see that  THE CELLULAR PHONE is back in the German Businessman's satchel briefcase. Templar and Jillian sit down. CUT TO: EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING The train pulls into the station. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING The Porter comes down the aisle, calling out: PORTER Moscow Station, Moscow Station! Templar and Jillian move with the other passengers toward the exits. As they pass the ladies' room: JILLIAN Give me a second, will you? I don't feel well. TEMPLAR Make it quick. Jillian goes in the bathroom. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM Jillian enters and stands on the toilet. Out comes the German Businessman's LETTER OPENER. She centers the opener in one of the screw heads, leans into it, and twists. She begins unscrewing it. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM Templar is impatiently looking at the ladies' room door. The passengers are filing past him. He knocks on the door. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM Jillian's got one screw out. The other is coming. Templar KNOCKS again. JILLIAN Just a second. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM Templar knocks again, LOUDER. No response inside. The German Businessman passes by him... GERMAN BUSINESSMAN Porter, I seem to have lost my letter opener... Templar stares at the guy. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES ROOM The door SMASHES open, splintering the lock. Templar bursts in. Something instantly gets his attention. The fully opened window. And no Jillian... Templar bolts out. CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING Jillian hurries up the escalator to the main concourse. A stupendous, vaulted interior. As impressive as Grand Central in New York or Victoria in London. She moves through the crowd. Eyes scanning everything and nothing. She bumps into A COMMUTER, who scowls. Jillian takes cover by one of the immense marble pillars. She pulls her collar up. Waits it out. ACROSS THE CONCOURSE - A MAN studies her. He's tall, blonde, looks like he played linebacker for Ohio State. He approaches. She eyes him. Everyone is a potential enemy. But this guy is obviously American. BLONDE MAN Ms. St. Thomas? Jillian? JILLIAN Yes. The Blonde Man opens his wallet, flipping out his EMBASSY BADGE and C. I. A. CREDENTIALS. WHITEHEAD John Whitehead, Special Agent, Central Intelligence Agency. Was your trip all right? JILLIAN Yes it was fine, oh who cares, I'm finally safe... (squeezes his hand) Do you have a car? WHITEHEAD Yes, outside. First I'd like to ask you some questions. That was an interesting story you told the embassy. JILLIAN Interesting? It's true. WHITEHEAD Please understand: the United States Embassy receives fifty calls a day. My husband's been murdered, my daughter's been sold into white slavery, you get the idea. So before we waste a lot of people's time, Ms. St. Thomas, you say you have p.h.d.s in chemistry and nuclear physics. What's the atomic symbol for, say. ..gold? Pause. Jillian stares at Whitehead. JILLIAN You've gotta be kidding me... CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING Templar dashes across the platform, looking everywhere. Jillian has vanished. Suddenly his cellular phone chirps. He unpockets it and clicks it on. TEMPLAR Talk to me, Frankie. INT. ST. PETERSBURG - FRANKIE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING FRANKIE, red-eyed and drinking coffee, is staring at the video transmission from Tretiak's office. Tretiak and Ilya are talking. . INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO (as deemed necessary) FRANKIE She called the U.S. Embassy a half hour ago. TEMPLAR What? (considers this) Does Tretiak know? FRANKIE Simon, the U.S. Embassy has more leaks than a Polish submarine. Who do you think intercepted the call? As FRANKIE says that, she doubletakes at the monitor showing Tretiak's office. Frankie's eyes widen. ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - A THIRD MAN has entered the room. It is the crusading reformer, MICHAEL ROMANOV. Frankie stabs a button on a tape recorder next to her monitors. It begins taping the transmission from Tretiak's office. TEMPLAR Thanks, Frankie. FRANKIE Simon, wait. . . . CLICK. Frankie turns some dials, bringing into ZOOM FOCUS Tretiak and Romanov. She ups the volume. We hear this: TRETIAK Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland. How will that sound to the average Russian? FRANKIE (a whisper) I don't believe it... CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - ESCALATOR - DAY TEMPLAR runs up the escalator, plowing through the disembarking passengers, taking two stairs at a time. INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING Templar comes off the escalator. The place is packed with COMMUTERS. He moves off, eyes darting in all directions for Jillian, while meanwhile  ACROSS THE CONCOURSE, BY THE PILLAR - CONTINUOUS JILLIAN . ..Cd, that's big "C" little "d," cadmium's valence is 2, its atomic number is 48 and its atomic weight is 112.411 or would you like that carried out five more decimal places? Good enough? WHITEHEAD (smiles) Good enough. Come this way, Ms. St. Thomas. He ushers her off. As they move from behind the pillar, 50 yards away -- ACROSS THE CONCOURSE - TEMPLAR sees Jillian and Whitehead. He looks around, thinking. He sprints for the side exit. EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - MAIN ENTRANCE/EXIT - DAY The circular drive where travelers are picked up and deposited by taxis, buses, automobiles. Jillian and Whitehead exit the station. AHEAD - TWO MERCEDES SEDANS are waiting. Several darksuited MEN stand next to an open back door. JILLIAN (shakes her head) What a nightmare.. To think my work could just be taken from me... WHITEHEAD You're safe now, Doctor St. Thomas. We'll have you back in New York in no time. They continue toward the parked Mercedes. Suddenly Jillian blinks. She sees something. It's TEMPLAR, driving a Russian sedan. He rolls to a stop across the circular drive, staring a hole right through Jillian, grimly shaking his head at her, trying to warn her... JILLIAN Agent Whitehead... Whitehead looks at Jillian. Pause. Jillian eyes Templar across the drive. AGENT WHITEHEAD Yes? Jillian looks at the men waiting by the Mercedes. She looks at two Moscow police officers standing to the side. Something's wrong. Something doesn't feel right. AGENT WHITEHEAD Ms. St. Thomas? You had a question? They're drawing closer to the waiting Mercedes... JILLIAN Nothing, I was just thinking that when my research was stolen I felt like the Buffalo Bills after they lost four World Series. WHITEHEAD Hah hah, I bet you did. I'm a baseball fan too hah hah... Jillian looks at him differently. The Buffalo Bills lost four Super Bowls, Whitehead. They continue toward the waiting sedans. JILLIAN'S EYES dart around. Her forehead is sweaty. And she bolts from him, taking Whitehead by surprise. JILLIAN sprints across the circular drive for Templar's car, Whitehead after her. The men by the waiting Mercedes converge on Jillian from the side. TEMPLAR throws open the passenger side door for Jillian. The men coming from the Mercedes open fire on Templar, blowing in the sedan's side window. Templar ducks. JILLIAN'S almost there... She reaches the open sedan and dives inside. She tries to shut the door; WHITEHEAD gets hold of it. JILLIAN SCREAMS at Templar. JILLIAN Go! Templar floors it. The car SQUEALS away from the curb. Whitehead runs alongside, trying to get the door open. The car accelerates. Whitehead sprints but can't keep up. His feet leave the ground; he clings to the doorframe through the blown-out window. Whitehead pulls his gun from his shoulder holster and aims across Jillian's body at Templar. His finger squeezes the trigger as Jillian shoves his hand up. BULLETS blow holes in the roof of the car. JILLIAN hits Whitehead, hard, in the head. Whitehead's head snaps back. She hits him again. Whitehead falls away from the car. He rolls twenty feet and stops, dazed but alive. INT. TEMPLAR' S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY Templar guns the sedan through a RED LIGHT. Cars to the left and right SCREECH to a stop. The sedan flies on... JILLIAN TAKE ME TO THE EMBASSY. TEMPLAR We're going to the airport. Templar guns the accelerator. EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - CIRCULAR DRIVE - DAY The TWO MERCEDES pull up to Whitehead, who staggers to his feet. He gets in the lead Mercedes; the two cars race off after Templar and Jillian. INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY Templar floors it through another intersection. he looks in his rear view mirror. There's no sign of the two Mercedes. They've escaped. TEMPLAR Good. JILLIAN Is it? Who's worse  them or you? Templar looks down and registers shock -- - - IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD, A BLIND MAN with a walking stick is tap tapping across the intersection. Jillian cringes, expecting the worst. Templar throws the steering wheel and -- EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY -- The sedan swerves, clearing the BLIND MAN by two inches, skidding wildly through the intersection. INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY Templar fights the wheel but he's losing... The skid can't be corrected. Jillian SCREAMS. EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY The sedan slides sideways, hits the curb and flips over, spinning like a top across the sidewalk. CUT TO: INT. WHITEHEAD'S MERCEDES - DAY The Mercedes moves through traffic. Whitehead and the other men look around. The Mercedes rounds a corner. Across the intersection is the OVERTURNED SEDAN on the sidewalk, surrounded by gawking PEDESTRIANS. EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION The Mercedes pulls up. Whitehead and his men get out. They warily approach the sedan, drawing guns. The pedestrians back off, getting the hell out of the way. Whitehead and his men surround the car. They kneel, guns trained inside...Templar and Jillian are gone. Whitehead barks at his men. WHITEHEAD Fifteen block radius. Go house to house. Whitehead looks around at the surrounding buildings. We FOCUS on one of them, a RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH several blocks away, under scaffolding and mesh wire, in the process of renovation. CAMERA pushes in on the church's HUGE ONION SHAPED TURRET. . . . . INT. MOSCOW - RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH  and we're in the turret's interior: round, with stained glass windows, a desk and chair. A trap door leading to the vestibule below BANGS OPEN. JILLIAN comes up, followed by Templar, his gun in hand. They're cut and bruised, exhausted. Jillian slumps against the wall, shivering. Templar puts his equipment on the desk and goes to each of the windows. From this elevation he can see the entire city. TEMPLAR'S FIRST POV - RED SQUARE, a mile across town, where a thousand Muscovites are listening to a pro Michael Romanov speech. Shifting from Red Square to the city outskirts, we see MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, where Remy waits. TEMPLAR'S SECOND POV - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY is just a few blocks away - we see the American flag flying from the roof stanchion. In the intersections around the embassy, Tretiak's men stand by their vehicles, watching. Every point of access to the embassy is sealed. We see WHITEHEAD. A Mercedes pulls up to him. ILYA gets out. TEMPLAR The embassy's surrounded. BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN is staring at Templar's computer. The modem is engaging. JILLIAN sits up, staring at the screen. Jillian reads an ELECTRONIC MESSAGE which appears: BEAR CONTACTING LION. GIVE HER TO ME. IN RETURN, 20 MILLION AND SAFE PASSAGE. IF YOU REFUSE YOU WILL DIE. Jillian's eyes grow wide with terror. Templar looks out a third window. TEMPLAR'S THIRD POV - Tretiak's men are going building to building in a fifteen block radius sweep, closing in on the church. TEMPLAR The airport's out. They're drawing a noose around us. We don't have much time. TEMPLAR turns away from the window. He sees Jillian looking at his computer. He walks over to it and reads the message. Jillian gets slowly to her feet, watching Templar. JILLIAN's mouth quivers as Templar types: LION CONSIDERING OFFER. Templar looks at Jillian. She stares back. A long moment. Neither moves. JILLIAN What are you going to do? Tell me. I deserve at least that. (desperate now) I'll die. If you take their offer, they'll kill me. TEMPLAR And if I don't, they'll kill me. Interesting situation I'd say. Jillian sinks to the chair, her voice shaking. JILLIAN Oh god. It's over, it's all over... You're not human. You're an animal. TEMPLAR I'm a businessman. I perform services for profit. And spare me the lecture. You didn't spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich. Richer than anyone on earth. Richer than God. (beat) I'll make you an offer - pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about one month's. . . Pause. She slowly looks up at him. JILLIAN I don't hold the patent rights to cold fusion. TEMPLAR What? JILLIAN You fool. Don't you understand? (her voice cracks; she begins to softly cry) It wasn't about money, it wasn't about becoming rich... TEMPLAR If you don't own the patent rights, who does? JILLIAN A foundation in my name. The royalties were going to go to scientific research, curing cancer, .. .christ how can you understand this... She lowers her head, weeping openly. CAMERA PUSHES in on Templar, staring at her. Even the darkest of men have a seed of goodness. Here, for the first time, does it flower in Simon Templar. But we don't know this. Templar betrays nothing. He picks up his homing device and clicks it on. He types in this command: MOSCOW. The device beeps; THE MOSCOW STREET GRID appears. He types a new command: SUBTERRANEAN DATA. Moscow's SUBTERRANEAN GRID appears superimposed over the street grid; we see the guts of the city; the Moscow subway, water and gas mains, etc. In a corner of the screen is a TABLE OF SCHEDULES. Templar analyzes the information on the screen. He quickly rises; goes to Jillian, pulling off his belt. He pulls her up. She stands limply, still weeping, no longer resisting. He's bigger and stronger, there's no use. Templar gathers Jillian's wrists together and ties them with the belt. He pulls her to the trapdoor and CUT TO: EXT. MOSCOW - SIDEWALK Several pedestrians walk by. Templar walks Jillian quickly to a MANHOLE COVER. He kneels and hoists the cover off. He points into the hole. Jillian, her wrists bound, steps down uneasily, her feet finding the top rung of a STEEL LADDER. She descends into the manhole. Templar follows. INT. MOSCOW - SUBTERRANEAN SEWER SYSTEM - DAY Jillian and Templar come down the ladder, dropping to the steel-gridded walkway over the Moscow sewer. Templar pulls Jillian twenty feet down the walkway. At this point in the wall there is a HATCH with a compression HATCHWHEEL, the turning of which opens the hatch, like on a submarine. Within the hatch we hear RUSHING WATER. TEMPLAR That's a municipal water main. In one hour you're going in there. Templar pulls out a SWITCHBLADE. Clicks it on. Jillian, shivering with terror, stares at the blade... TEMPLAR Listen. They shut it down twice a day for five minutes to clean the filters. Once at noon, once at midnight. Noon is in one hour. JILLIAN How do you know all this? TEMPLAR Part of my job. Now ask the logical question... JILLIAN .. . where does it go? TEMPLAR Very good. Under the United States Embassy. There's an exit hatch into the embassy courtyard. That's where we're going. JILLIAN We...? Templar lowers his gun. He lowers the blade to her wrists and cuts the belt. TEMPLAR You heard me. A long pause. They stare at each other. JILLIAN Then what happens? TEMPLAR Let's get to the embassy, then we'll talk about it. JILLIAN Templar - about that night at my house TEMPLAR Don't talk about it, okay? He turns away from her. She watches him. JILLIAN Okay. CUT TO: EXT. MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - DAY The Michael Romanov supporters are marching past the Kremlin with PLACARDS BEARING ROMANOV'S FACE, chanting: KARPOV MUST GO! Ahead, awaiting them, are -- Two units of MOSCOW POLICE in riot gear. A POLICE SERGEANT clicks on a megaphone. MOSCOW POLICE SERGEANT Disperse. Disperse! On come the Romanov supporters. Rocks start flying. The Romanov supporters push into the line of police. The police push back with shields and truncheons. A melee breaks out. The Romanov supporters surge past the police. It is a wild, uncontrolled, chaotic scene. EXT. MOSCOW - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - DAY ROMANOV SUPPORTERS flood past the embassy gates, chased by Moscow Policemen. Fights rage allover the street. A full-fledged riot is breaking out. OVERTURNED CARS are burning. LOOTERS run through the streets with stolen goods. We hear the sporadic CRACKLE of small arms fire. IN THE U. S. EMBASSY COURTYARD A U. S. MARINE and ARMY GREEN BERET detachment, grimfaced and heavily armed, stand silent vigil inside the embassy's wrought-iron gates. COLONEL WILLIAM CROSBY, embassy c.o., exits the embassy and approaches the front gates. A FULL BEER BOTTLE smashes at his feet, showering him. COLONEL CROSBY Jesus H. Christ. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE U. S. EMBASSY Ilya and his men stand next to their vehicles, silently watching the embassy. CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW SEWER SYSTEM - DAY The WHOOSHING water in the municipal water main begins to subside. Templar looks at this watch. INSERT - TEMPLAR'S WRISTWATCH - it is exactly 12 noon. TEMPLAR Right on time. The water subsides to a trickle. Templar grips the hatchwheel and turns it. Opens the hatch. Residual water spills out onto the walkway. Templar pulls himself into the water main. He extends his hand to Jillian. Jillian looks uncertainly inside. TEMPLAR Four blocks. Right under Tretiak's men and up into the embassy compound. You can do this. She grabs Templar's hand. He pulls her up and inside -- INT. MOSCOW - MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - DAY -- a four foot diamater pipe. Templar pulls out a PENLIGHT, switches it on and sticks it between his teeth. On hands and kneess Templar and Jillian move off through the water main. INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET Templar and Jillian crawl up. Templar shines his penlight at the ceiling; AN EXIT HATCH WITH HATCHWHEEL is above them. JILLIAN It doesn't seem like we've gone far enough. TEMPLAR We haven't, up there's the street in front of the embassy. (looks at his wristwatch) Come on. We've got two minutes. They crawl off through the water main. INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN UNDER EMBASSY Templar and Jillian crawl toward A SECOND EXIT HATCH. TEMPLAR There it is. They reach the exit hatch. They look at it. Jillian trembles. JILLIAN Oh my god... The EXIT HATCH has no hatchwheel. It's sealed. Jillian, panicked, looks down the water main. JILLIAN We. ...we've got to go back. TEMPLAR (checks his watch) Not enough time. (thinks) The hatch under the street. JILLIAN What about Tretiak's men  TEMPLAR Better than drowning. They scramble off. We hear WHOOSHING WATER coming down the pipe. JILLIAN The water's back on! Back they go, crawling as fast as they can. INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET Templar and Jillian reach the exit hatch under the street. Templar grips the hatchwheel as -- THE WATER ROARS through the pipe, hitting Jillian flush, blowing her backward; she desperately clings to Templar's shoulders as he spins the hatchwheel. The water rises mercilessly. There's a foot of air, then six inches, then just three, then none at all, and they're under water... TEMPLAR desperately turns the hatchwheel, spinning it one last time and WHOOOSH, the hatch door blows open  INT. MOSCOW - MANHOLE BELOW THE STREET - - and SMASHES against A ONE FOOT DIAMETER PIPE running along the wall of the service manhole, CRACKING a fissure in it. PRESSURIZED GAS blows out of the pipe. TEMPLAR pulls himself up. He reaches down and pulls Jillian up. Templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel shut. JILLIAN looks at the GAS spewing from the cracked pipe. She sniffs the air. Templar looks at the pipe. A warning is printed in five languages: GAS - DANGEROUS. TEMPLAR City gas line. JILLIAN We can't stay here, we'll asphyxiate. Templar and Jillian clamber up the steel runged ladder to the manhole cover. Templar pushes up the manhole cover, popping his head out, looking around. HIS EYES widen with alarm --- A POLICE VAN is rolling straight for his head. He ducks and closes the manhole cover as the VAN RUMBLES over it. Templar listens. Above, the van has stopped. Templar pushes up the manhole cover. The VAN has stopped directly over the manhole. EXT. MOSCOW - STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY Templar slithers out. Pulls up Jillian. They're under the van now. The van's rear door opens; TEN MEN jump down to the pavement. We see their BLACK BOOTS; they are MOSCOW POLICE, arriving to arrest the looters. Templar and Jillian crawl toward the van's rear. Templar looks toward THE U.S. EMBASSY. It's 100 yards away, but looks like 100 miles. TEMPLAR Both of us will never make it. But one of us can. (draws his gun) Give me ten seconds, then break for the embassy and don't stop running until you're at the gates. It's a hundred yards, so move it. JILLIAN What are you going to... TEMPLAR That's my business. JILLIAN Wait... (he stops) .. .Simon. Don't do this. They'll kill you. A long, tense pause. TEMPLAR The world can do without Simon Templar. It can't do without you. (smiles grimly) See you around sometime. He takes a deep breath and logrolls out. ABOVE THE VAN - TEMPLAR gets to his feet in the street, gun drawn. He races from the van, heading in a direction away from the embassy. ACROSS THE STREET - ILYA double takes, seeing Templar sprinting from the van. ILYA Kill him! Ilya, Whitehead and Tretiak's men sprint down the street after Templar, firing as they run, leaving -- JILLIAN UNDER THE VAN with a clear path to the embassy. She counts it off: three. . . . four. . . . five . . . . . TEMPLAR dives behind an OVERTURNED CAR and comes up firing on Tretiak's men. IN THE U. S. EMBASSY'S FRONT COURTYARD Colonel Crosby watches the situation unfold. COLONEL CROSBY What the hell is going on. IN THE STREET - ILYA, WHITEHEAD and the other men close in on Templar, laying down a withering fusillade of fire. Templar returns fire from behind the car. UNDER THE VAN - JILLIAN JILLIAN . . . nine. . . . TEN. . . . Jillian logrolls out from under the van. She sprints for the embassy gates. BEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR sees Jillian running for the embassy. As he returns fire, he exhorts her under his breath. TEMPLAR Go. Faster.. . . ILYA, firing on Templar, sees Jillian. He spins, running in a new direction. He's going to get Jillian before she can reach the embassy. JILLIAN, sprinting, screams to the embassy marines. JILLIAN Open the gate! IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - COLONEL CROSBY turns to his second in command, a Lieutenant JONES. COLONEL CROSBY Do it. Lieutenant Jones and a MARINE PRIVATE push open the embassy gates. COLONEL CROSBY watches Jillian helplessly. There's nothing he can do. Not until she reaches the embassy. On Jillian comes, legs pumping, feet pounding the pavement. ILYA is right behind her. She can feel his breath he's so close. Twenty yards. Fifteen yards. Ten... BEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR dodges bullets, corning thick and heavy now, and watches in terror as --- ILYA, with a desperate reach, collars Jillian. She shrugs off her jacket, leaving Ilya with the jacket but no Jillian. Jillian lunges through the embassy gates... ... and is instantly surrounded by U.S. Marines. Jillian looks up at Colonel Crosby, panting. JILLIAN I'm an American citizen. COLONEL CROSBY You have our full protection ma'am. (looks at Ilya) Back away from the gate. Ilya's black eyes stare at Colonel Crosby. He backs away from the gate. He turns and sees  AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR, out of bullets with his hands raised, surrounded by Tretiak's men behind the overturned automobile. Ilya, fuming, walks across the street to Templar. AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - ILYA walks up to Templar. With the calm efficiency of a hangman, Ilya puts his hand on Templar's shoulder and forces him down, down to his knees. He sticks his gun to Templar's head. He's going to execute Templar right there, behind the overturned car in the street. IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - JILLIAN, watching, frantically turns to Colonel Crosby. JILLIAN Do something! COLONEL CROSBY That's Russian soil out there, ma'am. Jillian turns away, horrified, shielding her eyes. BY THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR AND ILYA TEMPLAR (Russian) Wait. A cigarette. It's customary. Ilya looks at Templar. Looks at his men. And Ilya laughs. Chuckling at first, then open-mouthed. All of TRETIAK'S MEN laugh in Templar's face. Ilya takes out a cigarette. Hands it to Templar. Lights it for him. TEMPLAR (Russian) Thank-you. And Ilya and Tretiak's men continue to laugh. They won't be for long... Because Templar is looking at A GRATE above the municipal lines below. And TRETIAK'S MEN are sniffing the air, wondering why it smells like rotten eggs... Templar flicks the cigarette into the grate and dives away as -- THE ENTIRE STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY blows sky high as THE GAS MAIN ignites . Ilya, Whitehead, and the other men are blown off their feet. Some are killed. Asphalt and dirt rain down, followed by -- WATER, as the municipal water main goes up. Ilya and Whitehead get to their feet, looking around, water falling like a monsoon. Templar is gone. And the police van is SPEEDING away. INT. POLICE VAN - DAY Templar guns the van through Moscow streets. He pulls out his cellular phone. Punches numbers. EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY Remy stands by his jet, smoking a cigar, looking impatiently at his watch. His cellular phone beeps. REMY Simon, where the hell are you... You want me to do what? Remy clicks off the phone and scrambles up into the cockpit of the Lear. INT. POLICE VAN - DAY Templar guns the van straight for -- A group of TRETIAK'S MEN conducting the building-to building search. They pull two sedans into the intersection, blocking it. INT. MOSCOW INTERSECTION - DAY Templar doesn't slow - he accelerates, and hits the two cars where their bumpers meet, BLASTING through them -- -- and races on past the intersection. INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY Remy's Lear jet skirts Moscow rooftops, just 200 feet off the ground. As the jet clears the KREMLIN roof, we see majestic Red Square spreading before us... EXT. RED SQUARE - DAY TEMPLAR'S POLICE VAN roars into Red Square as -- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY'S LEAR JET touches down. In Red Square. It taxis to a stop next to Lenin's tomb. The police van SCREECHS up next to the Lear. Templar races from the van to the jet, dodging BULLETS fired from -- TRETIAK'S MEN, firing from sedans entering the square. The Lear jet accelerates straight for the oncoming sedans, lifting off, almost scraping the landing gear against their windshields. It wings into the air, clearing the top of the Ivan Memorial by a foot. And heads west. To freedom. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT - REESTABLISHING A shot of the city as we SUPER: St. Petersburg - two days later EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT The gates open. A BLACK SEDAN pulls into the drive and stops. Zubov gets out, then Dr. Singh, dressed in a conservative Indian suit, carrying a briefcase. Tretiak emerges from the mansion, greeting Doctor Singh. INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT Dr. Singh enters behind Tretiak and Zubov. They move to Zubov's lab table. Dr. Singh dons reading glasses. Zubov places Jillian's research before him. Singh flips a page, then another. He is awed. It's like Salieri looking at Mozart's sheet music. He's searched all his life for something and... another person has found it. DR. SINGH Yes. (beat) Yes. (beat) Yes, yes. . . . . (looks up) I will give you a list of the things I will need. I request solitude. Remove those men. (turns back to Jillian's document) Leave me now. Please. Tretiak and Zubov exchange a look. They exit. Dr. Singh rubs his brow, bearing down on the material, flipping through the pages which DISSOLVE INTO: PAGES being flipped, but these contain photographs... JILLIAN No. (beat) No. (beat) No. WIDEN TO -- INT. F. B. I. - MANHATTAN BUREAU - DAY JILLIAN sits with F.B.I. agents RABINEAU and LONNER. AGENT RABINEAU One more. Rabineau flips the page. SIMON TEMPLAR'S PHOTO stares at Jillian. She studies it a moment. Shakes her head. AGENT LONNER Be certain, Ms. St. Thomas. Look again. She looks again. Studies Templar's photograph. JILLIAN I'm certain. It's not him. Agents Rabineau and Lonner exchange a look. EXT. MANHATTAN - CENTRAL PARK - DAY Jillian walks down the tree-lined mall. Templar is standing there. She walks up to him. A moment. JILLIAN They showed me photographs of criminals. (beat) And a photograph of you. TEMPLAR And...? JILLIAN I said that the man in the photograph doesn't have the eyes of a criminal. (pause; they stare at each other) The Washington symposium is tomorrow afternoon. I'm going. I'm presenting my research to the scientific community. TEMPLAR What about your data... JILLIAN It's in my head. I'll wing it. TEMPLAR (draws closer to her) You need to conduct further research anyway. I'll help you. JILLIAN What are we researching. ..? Jillian draws closer. Their lips are almost touching... TEMPLAR The benefits of warm fusion. Templar pulls her lips to his and CUT TO... INT. JILLIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There follows a love scene. Afterward, in each other's arms: JILLIAN It is in the eyes. You're not bad. TEMPLAR Being bad is the only thing I've ever been good at. JILLIAN You can be good at being good. (she strokes his hair) If you're afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow. If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast. If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind. And if between right and wrong, do what is right. TEMPLAR Who said that? JILLIAN (smiles privately) My grandmother. Templar gently takes her face in his hands. Whispers to her. TEMPLAR How did I meet you. This saint. (smiles) Saint Thomas. They kiss. DISSOLVE TO: INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT Late at night. Dr. Singh is working feverishly. The desk is stacked with papers and books. He is surrounded by three chalk boards with chemical isotope diagrams. He is adding chemicals to a bath of hydrogen in a COMPRESSION CHAMBER. DR. SINGH Zinc oxide. Iridium mercurate. Sodium bicarbon nitrate. A cobalt magnesium isotope. Liquify the cobalt at 665 degrees fahrenheit, add the magnesium. ... The chemicals begin to mix. He picks up an ELECTRODE NEEDLE attached to a LIGHTBULB. Dr. Singh takes a deep breath. He introduces the electrode needle into the compression chamber through a rubber valve. And like a miracle, the LIGHTBULB ILLUMINATES. Dr. Singh looks up as if he's just seen Shiva. DR. SINGH My god. It actually works. DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

JILLIAN That question will be answered in ten minutes, Mr. Rothstein. REPORTER 2 Marilyn Jones, Doctor St. Thomas. Dr. Vijay Singh has said that your theories are insupportable... JILLIAN (smiles) Sorry, but I'm not interested in Doctor Singh's opinions on this or anything else. JILLIAN moves up the steps, radiant and beautiful; it is the pinnacle of her life. She looks across the Mall. TEMPLAR stands there. Alone, smiling at her. Jillian winks at him, mouthing the words: "open it." TEMPLAR understands. He pulls a GIFTWRAPPED BOX from his pocket and opens it. Inside is a TIE-PIN; a stick figure man with a halo over his head. Templar sticks it through his tie. Picks up the accompanying card. INSERT - THE CARD reads: Anyone can be a saint, Simon Templar. Templar looks back at Jillian. He sees something. Behind Jillian, moving toward her through the crowd, is a BLONDE MAN UNDER AN UMBRELLA. It looks like... Ilya. Templar squints for clearer vision. He begins walking toward the Smithsonian. He quickens to a jog, now he's running... ON THE SMITHSONIAN STEPS - THE REPORTERS crush into Jillian. REPORTERS Ms. St. Thomas, Ms. St. Thomas... JILLIAN Please, no more questions. ... Across the sea of people, TEMPLAR reaches the Blonde Man. Templar grabs his arm; whips him around. BLONDE REPORTER Hey! What's the idea? It's not Ilya, just a reporter with blonde hair. Meanwhile JILLIAN, backing up the stairs from the reporters, draws closer to - - A DARK-HAIRED MAN, seen from behind, who lowers an umbrella, pushing a button on the handle, revealing a GLISTENING NEEDLE POINT. CAMERA moves over his shoulder, revealing...ILYA. With dyed black hair. JILLIAN keeps backing up the stairs... ...Behind her, Ilya's needled umbrella strikes her. JILLIAN feels something. Like a bee sting. Her hand moves to her hip... .. .as ILYA moves off through the crowd... ...TEMPLAR comes through the crowd to Jillian. The F.B.I. AGENTS grab him. JILLIAN Stop it! I know him! The Agents release Templar. Jillian looks at him. Templar's panting, out of breath. JILLIAN Simon? What is it? TEMPLAR Are you all right? JILLIAN Yes. (smiles) Go get a seat. Jillian moves up the stairs into the Smithsonian. ACROSS THE MALL.. .ILYA is gone, melting into the sea of umbrellas. INT. SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE - MAIN HALL - DAY The room is packed with scientists and reporters. Jillian mounts a podium in front of the room. JILLIAN Good afternoon.

In international news, the situation in St. Petersburg worsened... CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - DVORTSOVAYA PLOSHCHAD - DAY The square is filled with thousands of MICHAEL ROMANOV SUPPORTERS. They're camped out now. A C.N.N. NEWS TEAM transmits from the square. WOLF BLITZER The scene is reminiscent of the Tiananmen Square crisis, Bernard. The death toll stands at forty-eight civilians and at least twenty-one armed forces personnel. Rumors escalated today that... EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - ADMIRALTY - ESTABLISHING A LIMOUSINE pulls through a 'crowd of ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the heavily guarded gates of the Admiralty, Russia's Naval headquarters, akin to Annapolis. WOLF BLITZER .. . General Nicolai Radischev... (we see a photo of Radischev) ...has promised Michael Romanov his support, pending the outcome of today's meeting between Romanov and President Karpov. ROMANOV, in the back of the limousine, waves to his supporters. They go wild, clapping and cheering. The limo continues into the Admiralty compound. EXT. ADMIRALTY - DAY The limousine rolls through a guarded checkpoint, stopping before -- THE ADMIRALTY'S NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY: in a more dangerous time, this is the place from which Russian military leaders would conduct nuclear war. It's an acre-sized field of concrete, recessed 30 feet into the earth. It looks like a very large, very deep swimming pool emptied of water. In the middle is a concave-shaped entrance hatch (visualize an enormous bowl turned upside down). The two halves of the concave hatch open down the middle, each side retracting into the facility. On the concrete floor next to the hatch is a SMALL DETECTION UNIT. We'll find about the unit shortly... Romanov and four bodyguards exit the limousine. Two RUSSIAN SECRET SERVICEMEN escort Romanov to the entrance hatch. They descend down stairs to -- INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS - DAY - - a large room dominated by an ELECTRONIC MAP OF THE WORLD. Rows of computer stations run the length of the room. It looks like a N.A.S.A. control room. The Secret Servicemen lead Romanov across the room to -- INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY An office, relatively comfortable, with a computer, a television and v.c.r., and a small satellite link. VICTOR KARPOV, the popularly elected President of Russia, rises. Karpov is 55, intelligent, with a calm, professional demeanor. ROMANOV A nuclear bunker, Mr. President? You must worry for your safety. KARPOV I have reason to. ROMANOV Yes. You do. They glare at each other. KARPOV You understand my policy on taping meetings. Romanov consents with a wave of his hand. Karpov motions to his ATTACHE, who flips the switch on a VIDEO CAMERA mounted in the wall. KARPOV I'll get to the point. Your remarks are irresponsible; they've caused civil unrest. Unless you appeal to your supporters to stop rioting, I will institute martial law. (beat) Tell me what you want. ROMANOV A public debate, then new elections. We'll let the people decide. KARPOV (considers this) Agreed. They shake hands. Romanov rises and exits. CUT TO: A HAND reaching for a SHOTGLASS. The hand shakes so badly.. .it has to set the glass down. WIDEN TO -- INT. MANHATTAN - LOWER EAST SIDE BAR - DAY -- TEMPLAR, drunk at noon in a wretched little dive on Avenue A. His face is drawn and pale. Haunted. Hasn't slept or shaved for days. His fingernails are dirty.

Inside is a plane ticket. A plane ticket to St. Petersburg... DISSOLVE TO: INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE - DAY Tretiak sits behind his desk. The room is dark. TRETIAK The woman's death was unfortunate. You lost. I lost. To think what we could have done with her formula. But life goes on, no? TEMPLAR sits opposite Tretiak, staring at him. He is shaved and rested, his eyes utterly alert. TRETIAK When Romanov gains the presidency Russia will be ours. The possibilities are, you would agree, endless. (beat) You have talent. Unique talent. I need that talent to break into an impregnable facility. Be part of this, Templar. TEMPLAR (considers this) Fifteen million, plus the fifteen you owe me. TRETIAK I owe you nothing. You were hired to steal something and you failed. TEMPLAR Thirty million, and I use my own men. TRETIAK Twenty million, and one of my men goes with you. Templar nods in agreement. Rises. Goes to the door. TRETIAK Templar. A question. (Templar turns) You had feelings for the woman, didn't you? TEMPLAR I don't have feelings, Tretiak. Templar, his face hard, cold, expressionless, exits. Tretiak watches him. CUT TO: INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - OFFICE - DAY A hotel in the heart of the city. We hear sounds of demonstrations and rioting in the street below. Templar sits at a table with Harry Winston, Remy Samarkand, and Frankie. ARCHITECTURAL PLANS and PHOTOGRAPHS of the Admiralty's Nuclear Situation Facility are spread amongst room service trays. ILYA, and the massive ZERO sit on the couch, listening. Ilya eyes Templar. Templar periodically meets Ilya's eyes. These exchanged glances are rife with hostility. They've been at this a while and everyone's frustrated. FRANKIE No, no, no, Karpov's office is in the nuclear operations room. The entry hatch can't be activated from above - only below. REMY It's lead-lined and reinforced with eight feet of concrete. Explosives and drills are out. TEMPLAR Electronic by-pass? FRANKIE Negative. Understand something, Simon, please: this is not a bank. This is the former Soviet Union's missile command. Forced entry is impossible. A long pause. Everyone looks at each other. Templar examines A PHOTOGRAPH of the facility. He fixates on it. He sees something. TEMPLAR What's that? Templar points at the SMALL DETECTION UNIT next to the Nuclear Operations entrance hatch. Frankie looks at the photograph, then picks up a set of blueprints. Starts flipping through... FRANKIE Uhhm.. .that is the facility's... (comes to the relevant page and reads:) ... radiation detector. In the event of nuclear fall-out it automatically closes the hatch. Everyone turns to Templar. TEMPLAR You're saying the system can think. FRANKIE Yes. TEMPLAR Then it can be lied to. CUT TO: INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - DAY Romanov and Tretiak stand on one side of the lab. ACROSS THE LAB, ZUBOV and DR. SINGH are huddled over a hydrogen tank, just like the one we saw in Jillian's lab. The tank is surrounded by hundreds of testtubes and beakers containing chemicals. TRETIAK The world will continue to spend half its gross national product on oil. ROMANOV And Russia will spend none. Within five years we will be the wealthiest nation on earth. TRETIAK And it's leaders, Romanov, the most powerful people. CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - ADMIRALTY - NIGHT The situation in the city has worsened. The ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the admiralty now number several thousand. They carry pro-Romanov banners and shout: DOWN WITH KARPOV! In the b.g., we see more rioting. Gunfire crackling. An overturned truck. A MILITARY AMBULANCE careens around the corner and rolls past the Romanov supporters up to the Admiralty gates. TWO RUSSIAN NAVY M.P.'s open the gates. The ambulance pulls inside. The driver's window rolls down. It's Harry Winston dressed as a RUSSIAN ARMY PARAMEDIC. HARRY WINSTON (Russian) Two soldiers shot by looters! The M.P. waves the ambulance through. Harry waves back. The ambulance pulls into the Admiralty compound, going past to the rear, to the NAVAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD. EXT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL The ambulance pulls up next to the emergency ward. The back door opens. Remy, dressed as a PARAMEDIC, gets out. Remy and Harry haul out two heavily bandaged RUSSIAN SOLDIERS on stretchers. The stretchers expand into rolling gurneys. Harry and Remy roll the wounded soldiers inside. INT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL Harry and Remy roll the gurneys through the emergency ward. NAVAL DOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling around, attending to WOUNDED SOLDIERS. The scene is frenetic. The gurneys roll past the operating rooms, through double doors, into a room. No one notices. INT. ADMIRALTY - HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM A room stocked with hospital supplies. The wounded "soldiers" spring off the gurneys. They are TEMPLAR and ILYA. Ilya wears the uniform of a NAVAL M.P. Templar wears a bulky, lead-lined anti-radiation suit. Templar shoulders his backpack. Harry Winston stands on a counter, pushing up the CEILING TILE. Templar and Ilya climb atop the counter. Harry forms a stirrup with his hands and hoists Templar, then Ilya, through the hole in the ceiling. INT. ADMIRALTY - VENTILATION DUCTS - NIGHT Templar and Ilya crawl through the ventilation duct to a WIRE MESH OPENING. Templar rips off the wire mesh screen. Thirty feet below, in the recessed entrance to the nuclear situation facility, TWO NAVAL GUARDS are walking their shift. They walk around the corner. . . TEMPLAR We've got sixty seconds. Move. EXT. ADMIRALTY - SIDE OF BUILDING Templar crawls out of the ventilation duct, his feet finding a windowsill. Just three inches to stand on. Ilya crawls out, his feet finding the same windowsill. The two men are side-by-side. They begin inching across the sill to a STEEL-RUNGED ladder leading to the concrete floor below. Ilya's FOOT suddenly slips. His arms flail. He tries to keep his balance, but fails. Templar catches Ilya's wrist. A terrifying tableau: Ilya, hanging over the concrete floor below, held up only by Templar. If Templar let's go, Ilya's dead. They stare at each other... And Templar pulls Ilya back. Ilya gets his footing. Catches his breath. Nods to Templar. They continue to the ladder and descend. EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards walk their shift. EXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT Templar and Ilya hurry across the concrete floor to the entrance hatch. Templar kneels next to the RADIATION DETECTOR, unshouldering his backpack. Templar's anti-radiation suit has a goggled hood, which he dons. He then carefully lifts from his backpack a PLEXIGLASS RECTANGULAR BOX the size and shape of a shoe box, and a high-powered cordless BOLTDRIVER. The plexiglass box has two' compartments, one empty, the other filled with SMOKY GAS. Templar positions the plexiglass box over the radiation detector. He unpockets FOUR CONCRETE BOLTS CREWS and bolts the box tightly to the concrete floor with the cordless boltdriver. (The plexiglass box has a steel mount with holes for this purpose.) EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards reach the end of the perimeter wall, then turn back toward the nuclear situation facility... EXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT Templar turns a knob on the plexiglass box; THE DOOR separating the two compartments within the box OPENS. Inside, THE SMOKY GAS releases. It wafts into the radiation detector's sensors.. ..Templar watches anxiously, talking to it... TEMPLAR Radon isn't plutonium but you don't know that... The detector's EMERGENCY LIGHT begins BLINKING. TEMPLAR Boom, you just got nuked. (unbolts the box) Now it's two months later and the radiation's gone... Templar rips the plexiglass box away from the detector, releasing the RADON GAS into the air. A moment passes. The EMERGENCY LIGHT turns off and, open sesame, THE CONCRETE HATCHDOORS separate, revealing STAIRS. Templar rips off his hood. He and Ilya descend. EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards are nearing the rear of the Admiralty. Around the corner is the nuclear situation facility... INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY Templar and Ilya race down. At the base of the stairs is the HATCHDOOR open/close switch. Templar throws the "close" switch. Above, the hatch doors start to close.. EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards come around the corner just as... ... THE CONCRETE HATCH DOORS pull shut. INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY Templar and Ilya move through the nuclear situation room to President Karpov's office. INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY Ilya and Templar enter. Ilya opens the credenza behind Karpov's desk, revealing ROWS OF VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES. Ilya rifles through the tapes. Templar kneels behind the T.V. and V.C.R. He switches the T.V.'s satellite link from "RECEIVE" to "TRANSMIT," and adjusts the satellite frequency. Ilya hands Templar a VIDEO CASSETTE TAPE. Templar throws it in the V.C.R. and hits a button. The V.C.R. transmits the tape over the satellite link to the - - EXT. ADMIRALTY ROOF -- Satellite DISH on the Admiralty's roof, which sends the transmission into outer space, where it bounces off a satellite and returns to -- INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT -- a V.C.R. in the hotel suite, where Frankie hovers over an array of sophisticated editing equipment. Tretiak, Romanov, and several of Tretiak's men stand to the side. Templar's transmission plays on a T.V. It's a tape of the Karpov/Romanov meeting: KARPOV Tell me what you want. ROMANOV A public debate, then new elections. We'll let the people decide. KARPOV (considers this) Agreed. Frankie hits "play" on A SECOND V.C.R.: Here, we see the Tretiak/Ivan Grachameeting, taped earlier: TRETIAK Upon what conditions would you accept a partnership? Be reasonable. GRACHA Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. Both V.C.R.'s are connected to a VIDEO MORPHING SYSTEM not unlike those used by filmmakers. Frankie hits some buttons on the morphing machine. On the first V.C.R. MONITOR - ROMANOV'S IMAGE is lifted from the videotape. It simply disappears. CUT TO: INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATIONS FACILITY - NIGHT Templar and Ilya, waiting. Templar looks at his watch. TEMPLAR Come on, Frankie... INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT Frankie, finished, hits "play." We see an altered version of the Karpov/Romanov meeting. Romanov has been morphed out and Ivan Gracha bas been morphed in. ON THE SCREEN, it now looks like this: PRESIDENT KARPOV Tell me what you want. GRACHA Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. PRESIDENT KARPOV Agreed. President Karpov shakes Gracha's hand. BACK TO SCENE Frankie turns to Tretiak and Romanov. FRANKIE Should I send it? TRETIAK Not yet. Romanov clicks on his cellular phone. ROMANOV General Radischev please. Yes, an emergency. Frankie, alarmed, turns to Tretiak. FRANKIE What's he doing? Templar won't have time to get out of there... Tretiak nods to ZERO who opens the door into the hall. TWO MOSCOW POLICEMEN enter. They stride over to Frankie, yank her up and handcuff her, dragging her off. CUT TO: EXT. ADMIRALTY - GARRISON - NIGHT The Naval Guard in the garrison looks up with wide, startled eyes at -- THREE RUSSIAN TANKS rumble up to the Admiralty, followed by a detachment of RUSSIAN ARMY SPECIAL FORCES. NAVAL GUARD (under his breath) Mother of God... The tanks smash through the gate, rolling into the Admiralty compound. The Special Forces Men walk silently past the startled Naval Guard, who rushes inside and hits a KLAXON HORN. INT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT Harry and Remy, startled by the klaxon, look out the storage room window at...the tanks. HARRY Come on, Simon, move it... EXT. ADMIRALTY - COMPOUND - NIGHT THE TANKS roll into the Admiralty compound: a message blares from one of the tank's loudspeaker: TANK LOUDSPEAKER (v. o .) This is a matter of national security. I repeat, this is matter of national... The tanks roll up to the nuclear situation facility. The Special Forces Men walk up to the open hatch. INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE Templar looks at his watch. He's waiting for Frankie to send back the morphed tape... TEMPLAR Come on, Frankie. Suddenly the transmission starts coming across the satellite link, recording over the old tape. It's almost finished... INT. ADMIRALTY - OPERATIONS ROOM - NIGHT The Special Forces Men come down the stairs and across the room toward Karpov's office... INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR BUNKER - KARPOV'S OFFICE Templar yanks the MORPHED TAPE from the v.c.r and goes back to Karpov's credenza. He kneels by the drawer. Something fast and unexpected happens, like slight-of hand. Templar pulls A SECOND TAPE from inside his suit and puts it back in the drawer, sliding the morphed tape under the credenza. He stands, turns, and freezes... ILYA (remember, he is dressed as a NAVAL M.P.) has his gun leveled on Templar. Ilya steps past Templar. Lifts the tape from the drawer - the tape from Templar's waistband. The door bursts open. The Special Forces men pile inside. The Special Forces MAJOR regards the situation. ILYA I found him over there. (holds up the tape) With this. SPECIAL FORCES MAJOR Give it to me. (turns to his men) Arrest President Karpov. Four Special Forces Men race out. INT. ADMIRALTY - NIGHT President Karpov and his wife are sleeping. The door blasts open, throwing a beam of light on Karpov, who sits up, staring with a confused expression at -- The SPECIAL FORCES MEN, glaring back at him. CUT TO: EXT. DVORTSOVAYA PLOSCHAD - EARLY MORNING It's 4 a.m., but revolution is in the air. Thousands of St. Petersburgers are pouring into the square. It is an anxious, surreal scene. RUSSIAN TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES surround the square. THE CROWD explodes with thunderous cheers as -- MICHAEL ROMANOV, escorted by soldiers, comes through the crowd. GENERAL NICOLAI RADISCHEV, tall, stern, career Army man, follows with a contingent of junior officers. Behind Radischev are TEMPLAR, FRANKIE and PRESIDENT KARPOV, under arrest, escorted by SPECIAL FORCES MEN. Romanov climbs atop a TANK TURRET. He looks out over the crowd. THE CROWD comes to a hush. Like Lenin's arrival at Finland Station. A history-in-the-making atmosphere. ROMANOV Friends, countrymen, I give you Major Antonin Scarpinin. Major Scarpinin (the Special Forces Major), climbs atop the tank turret. MAJOR SCARPININ Twenty minutes ago a team of Russian Special Forces, acting on confidential information, raided President Karpov's office... ACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK and his men emerge from several limousines. As Tretiak moves through the crowd, IVAN GRACHA and twenty of his men approach. TRETIAK Thank you for coming, Ivan, it is a great night for Russia. IVAN GRACHA I don't give a damn who's president. I'll make my money either way. TRETIAK Maybe you should take greater interest in politics, Ivan Gracha. Tretiak and Gracha turn to Major Scarpinin, listening... ON THE TANK TURRET - TEMPLAR and FRANKIE are shoved by soldiers up next to Scarpinin. Templar and Frankie exchange a steely glance. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY and HARRY come through the crowd. Seeing Templar and Frankie atop the tank, they stop in their tracks and watch... MAJOR SCARPININ This man, a known international thief, aided by this woman, a German operative, were arrested stealing a surveillance videotape from President Karpov's office. Scarpinin shows THE SEIZED TAPE to the crowd, then hands it to Romanov, who climbs atop the tank. TEMPLAR AND FRANKIE are pulled down from the turret and led away to TWO ARMY TRUCKS in the background. ROMANOV One month ago I said I would prove that those who call themselves our leaders... (points at KARPOV) .. .are in league with those who we know to be thieves, traitors, rapists of our once-great country. Do you want to see this proof? THE CROWD (out for blood) YES! Romanov hands the tape to Major Scarpinnin, who walks it over to an army communications TECHNICIAN standing by a portable V.C.R. linked to the HUGE SCREEN (seen in Romanov's earlier speech) above Romanov. ON THE TANK TURRET - ROMANOV points at the HUGE SCREEN. The crowd waits breathlessly. .:. ON THE SCREEN - the tape begins playing, but we don't see Karpov's office. Shockingly, we see...Tretiak's. Simon Templar stashed the tape Frankie recorded of the Tretiak/Romanov meeting in Karpov's office. We see: TRETIAK Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland. How will that sound to the average Russian? ROMANOV The average Russian is a fool. IN THE CROWD there is confusion, incredulity. ROMANOV'S eyes widen. TRETIAK and MEN stare in disbelief at the screen. IVAN GRACHA and his men slowly back away from Tretiak. ROMANOV He exists to be dominated. To partnership in government. TRETIAK No Romanov  to partnership in crime. MICHAEL ROMANOV looks down at the crowd and... . ...500,000 RUSSIANS stare back at him in silence. ROMANOV That.. . that it is a fraud... (turns to General Radischev) I can explain. RADISCHEV (motions to MAJOR SCARPININ) Arrest him. Scarpinin and his Special Forces Men close in on Michael Romanov, the crusading reformer. ACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK AND HIS MEN, huddled in a protective circle, stare into the angry faces of half a million Russian citizens. Total silence. A pin could drop. Tretiak and his men brandish their weapons. The intimidated crowd backs off. They move quickly toward their vehicles, the CROWD parting for them. A DETACHMENT OF RUSSIAN MARINES comes through the crowd. They are heavily armed and ready for business. Tretiak aims and fires. A MARINE goes down. CIVILIANS SCREAM and dive away. pandemonium breaks out. TRETIAK'S MEN open fire. The MARINES return fire. A harrowing amount of ammunition is expended in seconds. Ten of Tretiak's men and many marines take hits. ZERO dies instantly. A brutal, close-quarters firefight. The outnumbered marines take the worst of it. Tretiak, Ilya, and Tretiak's surviving men run past the fallen marines to their vehicles. They pile into the first two cars and SQUEAL away, heading down the Nevsky Prospect. ACROSS THE SQUARE - AT THE ARMY TRUCKS Panic and pandemonium. Soldiers running here and there amidst panicked civilians. A SPECIAL FORCES SERGEANT stands guard outside one of the trucks. A NAVAL PARAMEDIC, supporting a WOUNDED PARAMEDIC, staggers up. Harry Winston and Remy, of course. HARRY WINSTON (Russian) Sergeant, give me a hand. The Sergeant gives Harry a hand. REMY stands up; whips the barrel of his gun across the Sergeant's head, who collapses onto Harry. Harry drags him off and  REMY pulls the pin on the truck's doorlock. The door swings open. Templar hops down  TEMPLAR Get Frankie. Remy and Harry hurry off to the other army truck. TEMPLAR gets in the truck, sliding behind the wheel. He starts the ignition and throws it in drive. The truck rumbles forward, hopping the curb. THE ARMY TRUCK ROARS out of the square, pursuing Tretiak's vehicles down the Nevsky Prospect as, behind him -- - - the TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES also roar out of the square, followed by Russian Marines, Special Forces, and the enraged crowd. They too head down the Nevsky Prospect for the mafia headquarters... CUT TO: EXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Tretiak's vehicles wheel into the circular drive. No guards are present. Tretiak and men exit the vehicles and race inside -- INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Tretiak and his men hurry in. No guards here, either. Tretiak's on his cellular phone. TRETIAK Get the plane running, we'll be there in five minutes. (to his men) Clean out the safe. Burn the records in my office. Tretiak and Ilya go quickly to the basement stairs. Tretiak's men go for the upstairs staircase. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV' S LAB A T.V. shows a newscast from the Ploschad. Dr. Singh and Zubov, having seen everything that just transpired, are frantically destroying their data and records. Zubov is burning the cold fusion hardcopies in a waste basket. Dr. Singh is deleting the computer files. Tretiak and Ilya come down the stairs. Zubov pops a 3 1/4 disk from the computer. ZUBOV We reduced the fusion formula to one disk and destroyed everything else. TRETIAK Good. And Tretiak draws his gun. As does Ilya. Zubov and Dr. Singh stare at the guns. DR. SINGH What.. . what are you...? Tretiak shoots Zubov. Ilya shoots Dr. Singh. The two scientists fall, dead. So much for honor among thieves. Then Tretiak wheels on Ilya, his gun coming up. Yes, so much for honor among thieves... Tretiak freezes, startled. Because Ilya has his gun leveled on Tretiak. Tretiak tries to speak. Words won't form. Ilya FIRES. Tretiak pitches over backward. Ilya walks past Tretiak's corpse, yanks the computer disk from Zubov's lifeless hand and turns -- TEMPLAR stands across the lab, gun in hand. Ilya's eyes dart around the room. ILYA We can share this, Templar. TEMPLAR We don't own it. ILYA Who does? TEMPLAR (eyes glinting) The Jillian St. Thomas Foundation. There is a sudden shrill WHISTLING SOUND. Templar and Ilya look around. ILYA Don't be a fool. TEMPLAR I'm a fool? You thought you could get away with murder. Used curare didn't you? Induces blood-clotting. Templar clicks back the hammer... ILYA What do you want? The WHISTLING is louder. Anyone with military service knows the sound of incoming ordnance... TEMPLAR What do I want? I want.. . revenge. Now give me the disk. There's a massive EXPLOSION above. The laboratory is ROCKED. A SHELF OF CHEMICALS teeters over, falling on TEMPLAR, knocking the gun from his hand. The beakers of chemicals SMASH all around Templar Ilya sprints for the stairs. Templar grabs for his gun, lying in a puddle of CARBOLIC ACID. He grabs the gun; the acid burns his flesh. He drops it and races for the stairs. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Ilya emerges from the basement stairwell and races for the front door. Templar comes up; sprints after Ilya. Ilya, with Templar hotly behind, gets to the front door, flings it open, and... freezes. And Ilya and Templar are suddenly staring down the barrel of -- A RUSSIAN TANK. Just sitting there in the mansion courtyard. Russian soldiers behind it. Ilya and Templar duck. The tank FIRES. The MISSILE PROJECTILE explodes from the tank's barrel, flies through the mansion's front door over Ilya and Templar's heads... ... wings across the interior of the mansion... .. . and SLAMS into the rear wall of the mansion, exploding, blowing the wall down, revealing ANOTHER TANK at the mansion's rear, lumbering toward it. Ilya slams the door shut and whirls on Templar. They trade blows. Ilya has the better of this. He shoves Templar aside and races back through the foyer. Templar recovers and races after Ilya, tackling him in the middle of the floor. They roll on the floor, trading vicious blow after vicious blow, when --- -- A TANK SHELL RIPS into the mansion's domed cupola. Templar and Ilya look up in horror as -- THE 20 FOOT DIAMETER CRYSTAL CHANDELIER descends. Templar and Ilya dive away. The chandelier CRASHES spectacularly in the middle of the foyer, exploding like a glass grenade. A HUGE PIECE OF CRYSTAL hits Templar in the side of the head, opening a gash, dazing him. There's no place to go. Except up. Ilya races for the staircase. Templar recovers and takes up the chase again. Up the staircase they go. A SECOND TANK MISSLE slams into the dome, imploding it. CHUNKS OF STONE and MASONRY fall on Ilya and Templar, knocking them both backward. INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT The lab is rocked by the explosions. RACKS OF CHEMICALS in beakers fall to the floor, SMASHING. The chemicals begin to ooze together. A chemical reaction is occurring. The mixing chemicals begin emitting smoke. INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - CORRIDOR/TRETIAK'S OFFICE Tretiak's men are at the windows with automatic weapons, firing on the army below. Two men drag a crate into the office. They open it, revealing an  ANTI-TANK GRENADE LAUNCHER. They pull it from the crate and set up the tri-pod... ON THE STAIRCASE - TEMPLAR AND ILYA continue up the staircase. Ilya reaches the mezzanine. He climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater in the dome. He pulls himself up. Templar repeats Ilya's actions: climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater. As he pulls himself up... ILYA appears. He compresses his foot against Templar's knuckles. Templar grimaces. There's no way out this time. There's a burst of ORANGE LIGHT as A TANK SHELL explodes on the roof, knocking Ilya off his feet, allowing -- -- Templar to pull himself up to the roof. EXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS / NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT The tanks continue firing. Russian Marines fire round after round into the mansion. Tretiak's men inside return the fire. Harry, Remy and Frankie run up, looking with alarm at the vicious firefight. Realizing Templar is within... INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE The anti-tank grenade launcher is operational. One of Tretiak's men loads, the other fires, and -- EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT -- an ANTI-TANK SHELL launches from the window and hits the tank in the courtyard, blowing its turret off. Tretiak's men fire assault rifles from the windows. No one's surrendering. It's a fight to the death... EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ROOF - NIGHT Templar and Ilya, on the mansion's roof. The view is mind-boggling: the nighttime St. Petersburg skyline looming in the background and, below, three Russian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion. Across the exploding, crumbling rooftop, Ilya and Templar go. A TANK SHELL explodes in front of Ilya. Ilya falls, concussed by the shell. Templar dives upon him, wrenching the COMPUTER DISK from Ilya's pocket. Ilya slams his forearm into Templar's head. The disk flies from Templar's hand, scuttles across the roof shingles, falling through a crater... ... it flutters to the mansion floor, 50 feet down. They get to their feet, circling each other. Their footing is not trustworthy, like ice in Spring. Tank shells SLAM into the mansion's upper architecture and roof. A shell hits the mansion's east wall, detaching the DRAIN PIPE running up it. Ilya draws a SWITCHBLADE. Backing Templar up. Templar's at the very edge of the building. There's no place to go. Templar's feet are unsteady. Because the cornice of the building is crumbling beneath him. ... And Templar falls. He looks over his shoulder, his wrists turning, hands opening, and... ... Templar catches the detached DRAINPIPE. The drainpipe sags under Templar's weight, bending... And it stops. Templar hangs there, bobbing up and down above the alley between the mansion and the adjacent building, fifty feet below. Ilya turns back. He's going after the disk. Ilya jumps through the crater to the mezzanine and races down the staircase...while in the basement... INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT Another whole shelf of chemicals falls, smashing. The chemicals continue to mix... EXT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ROOF Templar dangles from the drainpipe. KA-CHUNG. It gives. It gives again. The drainpipe is about to break. Templar looks down into the flames and demolition below... INT. TRETIAK's MANSION - STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT Ilya races reaches the foyer. The building is imploding, chunks of stone falling all around him. Ilya's eyes are wild. He wants that disk... Ilya gets to it. Clutches it. It's finally in his hands. He goes for the staircase. ... INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT The chemicals are steaming now, in a froth, becoming more and more and more volatile... EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT Templar, dangling from the drainpipe, looks wildly around for an escape. If he could just get to that adjacent building... It's too far. And his hands are slipping... Then, from the mansion's basement, the very guts of the building, the chemicals in the lab detonate and -- THE MANSION EXPLODES FROM WITHIN. INT. TRETIAK' S MANS ION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT Ilya's eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him. Ilya falls, engulfed in flame, still clutching the cold fusion disk. EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT The drainpipe fully detaches from the collapsing mansion wall. It falls away from the mansion, with Templar still holding on... Templar releases from the drainpipe and catches the lip of the roof cornice of the adjacent building. Templar pulls himself up and looks back at... TRETIAK'S MANSION. The entire building comes apart at the seams. It crashes into a heap of rubble. FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT. MANHATTAN - REESTABLISHING - DAY The skyline of the great city as we SUPER: NEW YORK CITY - ONE MONTH LATER EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - ESTABLISHING It's mid-day. People coming and going. INT. ROCKEFELLER - AN OFFICE CAMERA PANS past the office door, stenciled -- ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION - CHARITABLE DONATIONS -- to a huge desk. Two middle-aged LADIES are going through a four-foot stack of MAILED DONATIONS. They are LUCY and DELORES. LUCY Here's one from that guy who owns most of Brooklyn. Ten bucks again. LUCY I'll alert the media. Guy's richer than god... DELORES (reads a check) Hey, Mr. Anderson at the Met gave a thousand this year. Lucy? But LUCY'S not listening. She's staring at a check. Her eyes are like hubcaps. LUCY Oh my goodness gracious... (looks at Delores) Get Mr. Thomas, Delores. DELORES What is it? LUCY A check for fifty... (gulps) ...million dollars. Delores gets up, goes to Lucy, who's hyperventilating. Lucy hands her the check. Delores starts hyperventilating. Lucy reads the letter: LUCY It's from a "Jillian St. Thomas Foundation," for the benefit of scientific research. DELORES Never heard of it. Lemme see. Lucy hands Delores the letter. INSERT - THE LETTER is printed under a letterhead with a logo design: the stick figure man with halo, the same design as the tiepin Jillian gave Templar. BACK TO SCENE Delores looks at Lucy. Lucy looks back. And over this we hear a voice. We've heard it before... JILLIAN ST. THOMAS If you're afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow... EXT. MANHATTAN - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SUNSET A lone man stands on the bridge. The spires of Manhattan rise above him. The sun is setting... JILLIAN ST. THOMAS If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast. If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind... CAMERA closes in on the hard, defiant face of a man who has changed a great deal in these months. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS And if between right and wrong... And Simon Templar joins Jillian here, speaking with her soul... SIMON AND JILLIAN ...do what is right. And Simon whispers to himself... SIMON I will do what is right. PULLING BACK, we see that the sunset has cast rays through the bridgework. And we can't be certain, it is vague, but the rays filtering through the bridgework seem to cast a halo over Templar's head. He is, now, The Saint. THE END to be continued...

               Boys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough.
               Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them.

               A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT

               A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT

               The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them.
               FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into
               the bow.

               THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS

               BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes
               the controls.

                                     A YOUNG SOLDIER
                         His face covered with the remains of
                         the motorman.  Starts to lose it.
                         Begins to shudder and weep.  His
                         name is DeLancey.

               THE BOYS AROUND HIM

               Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects
               them.  It starts to spread.

                                     A FIGURE
                         Pushes through the men.  Puts himself
                         in front of DeLancey.

               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far
               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,
               powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a
               cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
               helmet and lights the cigar.

               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
               terrified.

               Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?

               Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

               Delancey Oh, Jesus...

               Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your
               left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for
               those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're
               not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage
               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the
               cheek and moves on to the bow.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL
                         IN FRONT OF THEM.

               PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND

               It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none
               of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it
               belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his
               eyes back to the objective.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH

               The six surviving boats alongside.

               EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE

               From the landing crafts.  Arc toward the top of the cliffs.

               THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN

               A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft.  A dozen
               men are INSTANTLY KILLED.  Among them, DeLancey.

                                     MILLER
                         Somehow survives.  Jumps into the
                         breakers.

                                     MILLER
                         MOVE, GODDAMN IT!  GO!  GO!  GO!

                                     EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE
                         THE GERMANS On the edge of the cliff.
                         Rain down MACHINE GUN FIRE and
                         GRENADES.

                                     THE AMERICANS
                         Struggle through the surf.  FIRING
                         up as best they can.  Making for the
                         base of the cliffs.

               INCENDIARY GRENADES, HURLED FROM ABOVE,

               EXPLODE, SPREADING FIRE

                                     MILLER
                         Ignores the EXPLOSIONS and BULLETS.
                         Uses hand signals and curt orders.

                                     MILLER
                         THERE!  THERE!  HOOKS THERE!  FIRE
                         SQUAD, THOSE ROCKS!

                                     THE MEN
                         Obey instantly.  Set the grappling
                         hooks.  Take position.  Return fire.

               THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE

               Drown out most voices.  Except the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED
               AND DYING.

                                     THE MEN
                         Know what they have to do.  Start up
                         the ropes.  Into the teeth of the
                         German defenders.

                                     MILLER
                         Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine
                         gun.  Starts climbing with the first
                         group.

                                     THE CLIFF FACE
                         The Americans swarm up the ropes.
                         Taking turns firing up at the Germans.

               MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER

               A soft-faced boy.  Grabs him by the back of his collar.
               Roughly yanks him up.  Nearly choking him.  They boy climbs
               on.

                                     HALF-WAY
                         An American private is HIT.  FALLS,
                         taking two others with him.  All
                         three land on the rocks below.
                         Another way to die.

                                     NEAR THE TOP
                         Less steep.  They leave the ropes.
                         Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.

                                     MILLER
                         Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men.
                         Others bottleneck behind them.  Miller
                         scans the route and the defenders.

               Sees an open gap.  Deadly.  Beyond is a protective overhang.
               With a clear line to the top.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the route.

               Miller motions to six men huddled near him.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Take an instant to get ready.  Then
                         SCRAMBLE into the gap.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               Do their best to cover them.  POUR FIRE up at the Germans.
               Bad angle.  No Germans are hit.

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN
                         FIRE.  All KILLED.  They fall to the
                         rocks below.

               SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and
               best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.

               Sarge That's a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         It's the only way.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns to the next half-dozen men.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU'RE NEXT!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Move to the head of the gap.  Miller
                         moves for a better angle against the
                         machine guns.  Calls to JACKSON, a
                         tall, gangly Southern country boy,
                         sharp-shooter.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,
                         WILL YOU?

                                     JACKSON
                              (heavy Southern accent)
                         You betcha, Captain.

               Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.
               Turns to the second six.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Take deep breaths.  Head into the
                         gap.

               MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE

               JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.
               SARGE gets one.  Not enough.

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are
                         KILLED.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns, looking for the next six.
                         His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN
                         who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker.
                         Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy Brooklyn accent)
                         Captain, can I put in for a transfer?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start
                         the paperwork.

                                     THE THIRD SIX
                         Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller
                         exchange a look.  They both see the
                         madness of what they're doing.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               OPEN UP on the Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     SARGE
                         Rolls his eyes, takes a breath.
                         Scrambles into the gap.  The other
                         five right behind.

                                     IN THE GAP
                         BULLETS EVERYWHERE.

               Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce
               down.  EXPLODE below.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller
               sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.

               A perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING
               TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER

               SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He
               swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward
               Miller.

               A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant
               from death.

               SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE

               Under the overhang to safety.

               MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL
               IS BLOWN OFF.

               UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'll be Goddamned!  I'm not dead!

               Sarge hollers back to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO
                         THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!

                                     MILLER
                         I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.

               Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.
               HIT more Germans.

               SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop
               near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw
               long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.

               THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.

               Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.

                                     MILLER
                         Crosses the gap.  His men follow.

                                     AT THE CREST
                         The Americans swarm over the top.
                         FIRING.

               TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.

               Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans
               are CUT DOWN.

               MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man
               who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel
               charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade, your turn.

               Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.

               Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to
               the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.
               Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED
               EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.

                                     MILLER AND SARGE
                         Survey the field.

                                     SARGE
                         What the hell were you doing?  Drawing
                         fire!

                                     MILLER
                         Worked, didn't it?

                                     SARGE
                         You tryin' to get yourself killed?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need to, the Krauts go that
                         covered.

               Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff
               at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering
               the rocks and the beach below.  He's clearly affected.

               Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves
               on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German
               bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE

               EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of
               CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.  A huge government building stands
               in the heart of Washington, D.C.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:
                         WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C.

               JUNE 8, 1944

               INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Very busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,
               quickly and efficiently.  No small talk.

                                     A CLERK
                         Older than the others, sad-eyed,
                         adds a sheet of paper to a large
                         pile in his out-box.

                                     CLOSE SHOT
                         An outgoing telegram.  It reads:
                         "We regret to inform you...killed in
                         action...heroic service..."  This is
                         the paperwork of death.

                                     THE CLERK
                         Pulls out a file.  Reads.  Finds
                         something troubling.  Quickly shuffles
                         through some other papers.  Finds
                         what he's looking for.  Rises from
                         his desk and hurries out of the
                         office.

               INT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Seen through the glass wall.  The clerk speaks to a YOUNG
               LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.
               He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the
               office with the clerk on his heels.

               INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Again, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks
               to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly
               bothered by what he's being told.  The Captain takes the
               papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.

               INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               A busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The
               walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex
               deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of
               ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly
               hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff
               officer, walks in.

               Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know
               about.

               One-armed colonel Yes?

               Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha
               Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother
               was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this
               morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams
               this afternoon.

               The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear
               and freeze.

               One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.

               Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The
               youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First
               Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front.

               One-armed colonel Is he alive?

               Young captain We don't know.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.

               One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his
               heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go.

               EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY

               A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising
               behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.

               EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY

               A whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as
               far as the eye can see.

                                     IN THE YARD
                         A tire swing.  A bushel basket nailed
                         to the barn over a dirt basketball
                         court.

                                     A PORCH SWING
                         Sits empty.  Moves slightly.

               ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR

               Four American flag decals.  Each one, a man in service.

                                     MARGARET RYAN
                         Steps out.  Around sixty.  Her face
                         shows the lines of a life of hard
                         work and mother hood.  A good woman.

               She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the
               fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind
               the black car.

               She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her
               house.  She starts to grow uneasy.

               As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She
               reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.

               The car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out,
               one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come.

               INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY

               Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.
               GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to
               his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.  Half-
               a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and
               the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the
               file.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                              (softly)
                         Goddamn it.

               One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company
               in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan
               brothers died on the Juneau.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Any contact with the fourth brother,
                         James?

               One-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles
               inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines.

               General Marshall hardens.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Well, if he's alive, we're going to
                         send someone to get him the hell out
                         of there.  That's just what the
                         General's staff wanted to hear.

               EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY

               NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE.
               Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force
               of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the
               craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in
               the distance.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:
                         Normandy 1300 hours June 9

                                     MILLER
                         Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through
                         the fire and dives into a sludge-
                         filled crater.  He surfaces, sees
                         Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a
                         horrific smell.  Their conversation
                         is repeatedly broken by FIRING And
                         DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we
                         swimming in?

                                     REIBEN
                         Shit, sir.

                                     SARGE
                         Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're
                         in a cranberry bog.

                                     REIBEN
                         Out of the frying pan, into the
                         fucking latrine.

                                     MILLER
                         Look at the bright side, the Krauts
                         sure as hell don't want to advance
                         and hold this cesspool.

               Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.

                                     MILLER
                         Get Fire Control, we need some
                         artillery...

               Radioman Trying, sir.

               MORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben's worried.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, what if they send some other
                         company into Caen ahead of us while
                         we're pinned down here?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, we're the only Rangers
                         this side of the continent, we've
                         got to be first into Caen.

                                     SARGE
                         Who cares?

                                     REIBEN
                         I care.  Don't you know what Caen's
                         famous for, Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         Frogs?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie.

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah?  So?

               THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant.  Miller, Sarge
               and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German
               positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck
               down again.

                                     REIBEN
                         So, you ever heard of employee
                         discounts?  My uncle sells shoes,
                         gets twenty-five percent off
                         everything in the line, got a closet
                         filled with the best looking shoes
                         you ever seen.

               MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.

                                     REIBEN
                         Just picture some French number been
                         spending all day, every day, making
                         cream-colored, shear-body negligees
                         with gentle-lift silk cups and
                         gathered empire waists, what the
                         hell you think she wears at night?

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, how the hell do you know so
                         much about lingerie?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's
                         got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in
                         it, from the time I could crawl, we
                         carry Caen lingerie, it's the best
                         there is, it's all I been thinking
                         about since the invasion.

               Another pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS
               HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         There's a war on, good chance they're
                         not still making lingerie in Caen.

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Captain, they'll always make
                         lingerie, it's one of the three basic
                         needs of man -- food, shelter, silk
                         teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

                                     REIBEN
                         Happy to, sir.

               Radioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at
               H.Q., right away.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe the war's over.

               A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops
               falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben
               looks dubiously at Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I don't think so, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                              (to Radioman)
                         Stay at it until you get fire control.
                              (to Sarge)
                         Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles
               out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.

               EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY

               Chaos.  Under fire.  INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN
               SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Runs over the broken ground and makes
                         it to the sandbagged H.Q.  He stumbles
                         down the make-shift stairs.

               INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY

               Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which
               continue through the scene.  Miller salutes a Major.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.

               Major Go on in.

               Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a
               dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.
               Very busy.  A field map dominates the center of the small
               space.

               The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him
               respectfully.  He's clearly someone special.

               COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.
               He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of
               the storm.  He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...I understand your problem, but if
                         we don't get those tanks off-loaded
                         by 0600, we're going to have an entire
                         division up at Caen with its ass
                         hanging out of its pants...

               A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of
               paper.

               Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list.

                                     MILLER
                         My what?

               Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in-
               action.

               Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.

                                     MILLER
                         Find a chaplain.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...alright, let me know when.

               Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Have the Second and Third Regiments
                         hold at St. Michel until we get those
                         tanks.  Aide Yes, sir.

               Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Report.

                                     MILLER
                         Sector four is secured, we put out
                         the last three German one-fifty-fives,
                         found them about two miles in from
                         Ponte du Hoc.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Resistance?

                                     MILLER
                         A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery,
                         we took twenty-three prisoners, turned
                         them over to intelligence.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Casualties?

                                     MILLER
                         Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

               An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.

                                     MILLER
                         They didn't want to give up those
                         one-fifty-fives, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         It was a hard assignment, that's why
                         you got it.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Where are your men now?

                                     MILLER
                         Pinned down, a mile east of here,
                         waiting for some help from the navy
                         guns.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         I'm sending Simpson to take over for
                         you, the division is going to Caen,
                         you're not coming with us, I have
                         something else for you.

                                     MILLER
                         Sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         There's a Private James Ryan who
                         parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
                         First near Ramelle.  I want you to
                         take a squad up there.  If he's alive,
                         bring him back to the beach for
                         debarkation.  Take whoever you need,
                         you've got your pick of the company.

                                     MILLER
                         A private, sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         He's the last of four brothers, the
                         other three were killed in action.
                         This is straight from the Chief of
                         Staff.

                                     MILLER
                         But, sir...I...I...

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Spit it out, Captain.

               MILLER HESITATES, THEN:

                                     MILLER
                         Respectfully, sir, sending men all
                         the way up to Ramelle to save one
                         private doesn't make a fucking,
                         goddamned bit of sense.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

               The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel
               Anderson glares at Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         You think just because you hold the
                         Congressional Medal of Honor, you
                         can say any damn thing you please to
                         your superior officers?

               Miller considers the question, then smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir, more or less.

               Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head
               off, then he smiles, too.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Alright, I'll give you that.
                         Continue.

                                     MILLER
                         The numbers don't make sense, sir.
                         His brothers are dead, that's too
                         bad, but they're out of the equation.
                         Sending men up there is bleeding
                         heart crapola from three thousand
                         miles away.  One private is simply
                         not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson
                         This one is.  He's worth a lot more
                         than that.  Which is why I'm sending
                         you, you're the best field officer
                         there is.

               Miller Shrugs.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?
                         Fine officer, regular church goer,
                         writes poetry, he might like a mission
                         like this.
                              (beat)
                         And he's taller than me.

               Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's
               time to get back to business.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         That's enough, Captain, you have
                         your orders.  Major Thomas will fill
                         you in.

               Miller knows when to back off.  He salutes.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Good luck, John.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank you, sir.

               Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.
               Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices
               the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they
               go back to work.

               EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY

               A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the
               deck of the enormous ship.

               EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY

               HUGE EXPLOSIONS.  The big naval shells SLAM into the German
               position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field.

                                     IN THE CRATERS
                         Miller's Ranger company ducks and
                         covers.  The BARRAGE SUBSIDES.  The
                         Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging
                         from crater to crater, advancing
                         against the remaining Germans who
                         return SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs and dives into a crater
                         with Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge,
                         we're heading out.

                                     SARGE
                         Caen?

                                     MILLER
                         I wish.  You and I are taking a squad
                         up to Ramelle on a public relations
                         mission.

                                     SARGE
                         You?  Leading a squad?

                                     MILLER
                         Some private up there lost three
                         brothers, got a ticket home.

                                     SARGE
                         What about the company?

                                     MILLER
                         Simpson.

                                     SARGE
                         Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking
                         pogo stick!

                                     MILLER
                         I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with
                         his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.

                                     SARGE
                         Beasley's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade.  Translators?

                                     SARGE
                         Fresh out.

                                     MILLER
                         What about Talbot?

                                     SARGE
                         Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn,
                         I'll go see if I can find another
                         one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and
                         Wade, meet me at transport.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the
               crater and crouch-run in opposite directions.

               EXT. TRANSPORT H.Q. - NINETEENTH INFANTRY - DAY

               Just in from the beaches.  DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS.
               Nothing close.  Dust.  Confusion.  Vehicles of every sort
               moving out.  Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks.  In the middle
               of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make-
               shift desk made out of crate.  He yells at a PRIVATE.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS OUT
                         OF THERE!

               Private They're blocked in!

                                     SERGEANT
                         THEN UNBLOCK 'EM!

               SARGE< REIBEN, JACKSON AND WADE

               Wait nearby.  Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering.
               The others are relaxed.

                                     MILLER
                         Strides through the chaos, avoiding
                         the passing vehicles.  He sees his
                         men and walks toward them.  Reiben
                         hurries up to Miller, pleading.

                                     REIBEN
                         Please, sir, you can't take me to
                         Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir,
                         please, I told you, they make Caen
                         lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's
                         the best there is, it's...oh, please,
                         sir...

                                     MILLER
                         Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're
                         the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (desperate)
                         No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or
                         what about Faulkner?  Or that little
                         guy with the glasses?

                                     MILLER
                         Trust me, you're the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (whimpering)
                         But, sir...

               Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides
               off toward the Supply Sergeant's table.  Sarge falls in next
               to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         You get a translator, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I've got a line on one.

                                     TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE
                         Chaos.  Vehicles THUNDERING by.  The
                         Supply Sergeant juggles runners and
                         paperwork.  Miller steps up to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, I need a truck.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how
                         'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top,
                         red with black interior.

                                     MILLER
                         White-walls?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         No white-walls, sir, there's a war
                         on.
                              (to the Private)
                         NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER
                         THERE!
                              (to Miller)
                         I can't help you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         A half-track, anything.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir.  Division is using
                         everything on wheels to get up to
                         Caen.
                              (notices Miller's
                              shoulder patch)
                         How come you guys aren't going?

               Miller ignores the question.  He spies a jeep.

                                     MILLER
                         How about that jeep?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog
                         told me if anyone breathes on it,
                         I'll get busted and if anyone so
                         much as touches it with their little
                         finger, I'll get court marshaled.
                         If you were to take it, they'd shoot
                         me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk
                         all the way up to Ramelle?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         What's at Ramelle beside a lot of
                         Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going
                         home, if he's alive.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Senator's son?

                                     MILLER
                         No, three brothers of his were killed
                         in action.  Command wants him out of
                         there.

               The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Damn...I got a couple brothers...

               Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly.  The Supply
               Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY

               Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep.
               Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam
               of men and vehicles.  Miller rides shotgun.  Reiben, Jackson
               and Wade are crammed in the back.

               The SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go.  Behind him, GENERAL
               GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his
               huge staff.  He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.

                                     GENERAL GAVIN
                         SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY
                         GODDAMNED JEEP!?

               The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns
               to take his lumps.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American
               staging area.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to make one stop.

               Miller points the way for Sarge.

               EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly
               white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles
               and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.
               SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out.

                                     MILLER
                         Wait here.

               He strides into the tent.

               INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious
               nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and
               gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,
               detailed work.

               One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
               patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
               glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
               EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
               Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

               Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

               Upham Sir, I'm Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         I understand you speak French and
                         German.

               Upham Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have an accent?

               Upham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a
               touch of the Bavarian.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, you've been re-assigned to me,
                         we're going to Ramelle.

               Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.

               Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.

                                     MILLER
                         That's my understanding.

               Upham Lots of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have a problem with that,
                         Corporal?

               Upham Sir, I've never been in combat.  I make maps.  I
               translate.

                                     MILLER
                         I need a translator, all mine have
                         been killed.

               Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll come back to you.  Get your
                         gear.

               Upham hesitates.

               Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?

               Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

               Upham I'm writing a book and I...

               Miller's expression gives him his answer.

               Upham Uh, how about a pencil?

                                     MILLER
                         A small one.

               Miller shoos him off.

                                     MILLER
                         Go, go...

               Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the
               others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA
               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
               in military history.

               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered
               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles
               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-
               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships
               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of
               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some
               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny
               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day
               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are
               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
               equipment, bodies.

               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine
               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly
               take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in
               the back of the jeep.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, can I ask you a question?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         Where are you planning on putting
                         Private Ryan, sir?

               Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         It's just that it's kind of crowded
                         back here, I was wondering if you're
                         expecting to have more room on the
                         way back?

               Miller points out a turn to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Left.

               Sarge makes the turn.  Miller folds up the map and pockets
               it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now we've got a straight shot, due
                         north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,
                         two villages between here and there,
                         St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take
                         the jeep as far as we can, then go
                         on on foot.

                                     SARGE
                         We in radio contact with anybody up
                         there?

                                     MILLER
                         Somebody put the wrong crystals in
                         every one of the Hundred-and-First's
                         radios the night before the drop,
                         not one of them works.  We're going
                         in blind.

                                     REIBEN
                         I usually like surprises.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we likely to run into?

                                     MILLER
                         A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut
                         divisions, no fronts, no lines, the
                         drops were completely fouled up,
                         we've got little pockets of
                         paratroopers all over the place,
                         trying to hang on.  Command says we
                         hold St. Mere, but north of that,
                         it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's
                         where he's supposed to be, he's more
                         than likely dead.

                                     SARGE
                         Hell of a mission.

                                     MILLER
                         Yep, hell of a mission.

               IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP

               Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring
               at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful
               smile.

               Upham Hi.  So, uh, you're all Rangers?

               Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an
               insect.

               Upham I'm Upham.

               (pointing at his corporal's stripes)

               Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.
               Their jaws drop.

                                     REIBEN
                              (to Wade)
                         You want to shoot him, or should I?

               Wade It's not my turn.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,
                         Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

               Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.

               Upham Miller?

                                     MILLER
                         I don't want anybody to shoot him,
                         that's an order.  He speaks French
                         and his German has a touch of the
                         Bavarian.

               Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?

               Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         ...who won the Congressional Medal
                         of Hon...?

               Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances
               of Miller's men.  Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-
               faced.

               No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as
               if it had never happened.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony
                         of this mission is fucking killing
                         me.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, how so?

                                     REIBEN
                         I should be on my way to Caen, sir.
                         It's like Beethoven, the guy's one
                         of the greatest composers ever lived
                         and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean,
                         who'd he piss off?  And here I am,
                         the Beethoven of ladies foundation
                         garments, one step away from Caen,
                         the center of the known lingerie
                         universe and instead, I'm going to
                         Ramelle to save some fucking private
                         who's probably already dead.

                                     MILLER
                         There's to be a bright side, look
                         for it.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous
                         for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company
                         is going to Caen and we're going to
                         the goddamned cheese capital of
                         France.  There is no bright side.

                                     MILLER
                         There's always a bright side.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm listening, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Well, I, for one, like cheese.

               Wade pipes up cheerfully.

               Wade Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's
               something up there for me to blow up.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, you're a happy idiot.

               THEY ROUND A TURN

               SKID TO A STOP AT A:

               BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES

               A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him.

                                     MILLER
                         How's the road up to St. Mere?

               Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding
               somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.

                                     MILLER
                         Anybody getting through?

               Lieutenant The lucky ones.

               Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying
               gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels
               down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters.
               They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct
               hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.

               AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS

               On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of
               a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham
               grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's
               reaction.

                                     IN THE BACK
                         The men bounce up and down like
                         stuffed animals, doing their best to
                         not be thrown out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, this is better than Coney
                         Island!

                                     A HUGE BUMP
                         Bounces Reiben up and slams his back
                         down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN
                         PAIN.

                                     MILLER
                         Just trying to make room for Ryan.

               Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his
               shovel from under his bruised ass.

               THEY ROUND A BEND

               See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning,
               obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN

               Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER

                                     MILLER
                              (sweetly)
                         Sarge?

               SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on.

                                     ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES
                         Thirty yards ahead of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Directs Sarge off the road.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got the road zeroed.

                                     SARGE
                         Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep
                         off the road.

                                     THE JEEP BOUNCES
                         Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing
                         everyone out.  Somehow they hang on.
                         The jeep tears along the rutted field.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Just behind them.

                                     SARGE DRIVES MADLY
                         Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid
                         the biggest ruts and bumps.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Close on their side.  Showers them
                         with debris.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus Christ!

               MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN

               Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got a hell of a spotter
                         somewhere.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Even closer.  The jeep's PEPPERED
                         WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH
                         the smoke.

                                     MILLER
                         S-curves, Sarge.

                                     SARGE
                         Turns shallow curves without slowing
                         down.

               SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER

               Tries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned
               earth.  STOPS SHORT.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON

               THROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt.

                                     SARGE AND MILLER
                         Hang on.  Stay in the jeep but are
                         battered.  All stunned.  MILLER Is
                         first to regain his bearings.  Jumps
                         up.  Checks out the jeep.  Undamaged.
                         Deep in the soft dirt.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge!  Reverse!

               Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.
               The wheels spin.  Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.
               Yells to the others.

                                     MILLER
                         COME ON!  YOU WANNA WALK?

                                     STILL DAZED
                         Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw
                         their heads back on.  Shoulder into
                         the jeep.  Push for all they're worth.
                         The WHEELS STILL SPIN.

               ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT

                                     MILLER IGNORES IT
                         He's the only one who does.

                                     SARGE
                         Captain, they got us zeroed.

               Upham is very nervous.

                                     UPHAM
                         That's bracketing, right?

               They all ignore him.

                                     UPHAM
                         I know about bracketing.  I read
                         about it.  The next one is going to
                         land right on us.

                                     MILLER
                         FORWARD!  FORWARD!
                              (beat)
                         NOW REVERSE!

               Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE.  Rocks it.  SLAMS IT BACK
               INTO FORWARD.  Makes progress.

               ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP.  WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     MILLER
                         PUSH!

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     THE TIRES SCREAM
                         A bit more progress.  It's almost
                         out.

               THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS

               Knowing the shell is coming any second.  Upham is beside
               himself.

                                     SARGE
                              (sweetly)
                         Oh, Captain...

                                     ONE MORE PUSH
                         The jeep rocks back in, deeper.

                                     MILLER
                         SHIT!

               THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE MEN
                         Instantly take off.  Away from the
                         jeep.  As fast as they can.

               THE SHELL SCREAMS IN

               The men hit the dirt.

                                     DIRECT HIT
                         OBLITERATING THE JEEP

                                     THE MEN
                         Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.
                         STUNNED by the concussion.  SHOWERED
                         with dirt, rock and debris.

                                     MILLER
                         Is first up.  Sarge and the men
                         struggle to their feet.  Hear MORE
                         INCOMING.  Miller grabs Upham by the
                         collar and pulls him up.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE COME THE MORTARS!

               THEY ALL TAKE OFF

               Running as fast as they can.

               THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN

               The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between.  But
               there must be a dozen mortars firing.  The shells are almost
               constant.

                                     THE FIELD
                         The six Americans run madly, in zig-
                         zag patterns through the gauntlet of
                         MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  BOOM

                                     RUNNING, STUMBLING
                         BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

               UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND

               Miller yanks him up.  Half-drags him to the edge of the field.

               THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES

               Keep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards
               in.

                                     THE EXPLOSIONS STOP
                         THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling
                         to catch their breath. Check their
                         body parts.  Everything's there.
                         They have their weapons, most of
                         their gear.

               Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is
               nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         General Gavin is going to be very
                         irritated at you, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands on the edge of the woods,
                         almost in a trance.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

                                     SARGE
                         Sssssh!

               Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from
               position to position.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, maps.

               Sarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent,
               frozen in place.

                                     MILLER
                         Two eighty-eights, just under two-
                         and-a-half miles, that way, vector
                         from the jeep, through those two
                         trees at the base of the hill.  The
                         mortars came from behind that rise,
                         there, four of them.

               Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out
               of it.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade, the radio.

               Wade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed.

                                     UPHAM
                         You can tell all that, just by the
                         sound, sire?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not all.  There were nine
                         gunners on the eighty-eights, one
                         had a broken heel on his boot, two
                         had bratwurst for supper last night,
                         one of them is named Fritz, the other,
                         Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard
                         to tell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Corporal, you have just seen one of
                         Captain Miller's many God-given
                         talents.  If, by some miracle, you
                         survive, you will witness many more
                         of them.

               Sarge finished vectoring.

                                     SARGE
                         Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care
                         of those eighty-eights?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not what we're here for.

                                     WADE
                              (re. radio)
                         I've got command, Captain.

               Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                              (into radio)
                         This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,
                         sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-
                         three by baker-three.  Two eighty-
                         eights.  Tell our boys to come in
                         low from the east in case the Krauts
                         have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over.

               A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade
               packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir,
               wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.

                                     SARGE
                         He's right, Captain, it might be
                         kind of dangerous for those flyboys.

                                     MILLER
                         Tell that to Private James Ryan.
                         We've got our orders.  Let's go.

               Miller heads off without pausing or looking back.  The rest
               of the men don't like it, but they follow.  Upham trails,
               amazed at Miller.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               Miller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in
               alongside Reiben.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     REIBEN
                         Get lost.

               Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     JACKSON
                         You writin' a book or somethin'?

                                     UPHAM
                         As a matter of fact, I am.

                                     JACKSON
                         Figured.

               Wade overhears and smiles at Upham.

                                     WADE
                         I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E,
                         I'm small but wiry, with piercing,
                         steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn
                         but handsome face, I'm from Colorado,
                         my father's a mining engineer, don't
                         you take notes?

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         Demolition, right?

                                     WADE
                         Since I was nine years old.  They
                         got a lot of explosives around mines.
                         Me and my little brother could get
                         into any warehouse you ever saw.
                         Damn, we had fun!

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork,
                         Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher.
                         Him and his two brothers got a
                         ministry, The Blessed Church of the
                         Wandering Gospel.

                                     UPHAM
                         In West Fork?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the back of a nineteen and thirty-
                         one stretch Hudson with a big ole'
                         trailer.

                                     UPHAM
                         No kidding.

                                     JACKSON
                         I don't make jokes about things of,
                         or related to, the preaching of the
                         Holy Gospel, including the ministerial
                         calling of my family.

                                     UPHAM
                         So they travel around from place to
                         place and preach?

                                     JACKSON
                         We got us a tent, forty-two feet
                         across, eighteen feet at center,
                         hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs.
                         Circuit's eleven towns, covers all
                         'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller
                         County.  I expect that upon completion
                         of my military service I will be
                         joinin' said ministry.

                                     UPHAM
                         What about the Captain?  Where's he
                         from?

               They all shake their heads.  Miller's out of earshot.

                                     JACKSON
                         You figure that out, you got yourself
                         one nice prize.

                                     SARGE
                         Over three hundred bucks, last I
                         heard.  Wade Company's got a pool,
                         five bucks gets you in, whoever
                         guesses where the Captain's from and
                         what he did as a civilian gets it
                         all.

                                     JACKSON
                         The whole kit and caboodle.

                                     UPHAM
                         But everybody's heard of him, he won
                         the Congressional Medal of Honor, he
                         saved a dozen men.

                                     REIBEN
                         We know.

                                     UPHAM
                         Somebody must know where he's from,
                         what he did for a living.

                                     SARGE
                         Somebody probably does.

                                     UPHAM
                         Why don't you just ask him?

                                     JACKSON
                         The Captain prefers not to discuss
                         certain aspects of his life, in
                         particular, everything up to and
                         including his enlistment in the United
                         States Army.

                                     SARGE
                         I've been with him since Anzio.  I'm
                         closer to him that I am to my own
                         brother but I don't even know what
                         state he's from.  Somewhere in the
                         Northeast as near as I can figure.
                         I don't even have a clue what he did
                         for a living as civilian.

               Reiben shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         No one's gonna win the money for the
                         simple reason that the Captain never
                         was a civilian.  They assembled him
                         at O.C.S. out of spare body parts
                         from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a
                         fact.

                                     JACKSON
                              (defensively)
                         You got somethin' against the Cap'n?

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, no.  I think he's the best
                         officer in the whole goddamned army,
                         bar none.

               They all nod in assent, no argument there.

                                     JACKSON
                         You got that right.

               Miller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation.  Upham
               watches Miller, with even more curiosity.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a
               country cow path.  They're staying close to the cover of the
               brush.  Miller walks tall now.

                                     JACKSON
                         Captain, my feet are most
                         uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we
                         was gonna have to walk all the way
                         to Ramelle, I never would 'a
                         volunteered for this here mission.

                                     MILLER
                         You didn't volunteer, Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                         I most likely would have, sir, had I
                         been given the opportunity.

                                     REIBEN
                         If we find Ryan and he's still alive,
                         that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry
                         this goddamned B.A.R. back to the
                         beach for me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Army life is too dang easy, my feet
                         have gone soft.  Back home, we go
                         out squirrel huntin', I walk forever
                         and a day and then some, don't even
                         raise a blister.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what a B.A.R. weighs?
                         Nineteen and a half pounds, not
                         counting ammo.
                              (re. ammo bandoleers)
                         And you think these things are
                         comfortable?  They may look good but
                         they weigh twelve pounds each, that's
                         thirty-six pounds, right there.

                                     WADE
                         So what?  I've got three satchel
                         charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen-
                         and-a-half pineapples, and all my
                         regular gear.  You don't hear me
                         complaining.

                                     REIBEN
                         That's because, as I have pointed
                         out on numerous occasions, you are a
                         happy idiot.

                                     WADE
                         No, I just happen to take the
                         Captain's advice and look at the
                         bright side of things.

                                     UPHAM
                         How do you do it?

                                     WADE
                         It's easy, it runs in my family,
                         take my grandfather, for example...

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to
                         that grandfather thing again.

                                     WADE
                         As I was saying, before I was so
                         rudely interrupted, my grandfather
                         got old, as grandfathers tend to do.
                         He needed someone to take care of
                         him.  We move around all the time,
                         going from one mine to another, so
                         we had to put him in a home.  Nice
                         enough place but kind of depressing.
                         But not for Granddad.  He just
                         convinced himself he was on a cruise
                         ship, going to Tahiti, he had his
                         own cabin, first class, with room
                         service.  It just so happened that
                         the weather was always lousy, so he
                         never bothered to go up on deck.
                         Happiest guy you ever saw until the
                         day he died.

                                     UPHAM
                         You think he really believed it?

                                     WADE
                         Who knows?  It worked.

                                     REIBEN
                         Fine, you convince yourself you got
                         a pack full of feathers and goddamned
                         Private James Ryan can carry my
                         fucking gear.

                                     WADE
                         Reiben, you can be very unpleasant
                         to be around sometimes.

                                     REIBEN
                         You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I
                         can do much better than this.

                                     WADE
                         Look at Upham, you don't hear him
                         complaining.

               Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a
               shot.

                                     UPHAM
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I was
                         just thinking...

               The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         That I'm so fucking tired of this
                         goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand
                         dollars to see that bastard Ryan
                         crawl on his belly over an acre of
                         broken glass to hear my great-aunt
                         Martha fart through a field-phone.

               The men are stunned.

                                     REIBEN
                         Jesus Christ, he's a natural!

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, are you sure you've never
                         been in combat?

               Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain
               I'd remember.

               Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.

                                     MILLER
                         He's good.

               They walk on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable.

               Miller smiles, situation normal.

               EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active
               battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR
               EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers
               crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.

               Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a
               couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across
               and disappear into the remains of a building.

               Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a
               corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread
               out down the block behind him.

               Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental
               picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of
               an alley across the street and down the block.  They are
               CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.

               As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET
               SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.

               Miller motions Jackson across first.

                                     MILLER
                         Stay low.

               Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,
               kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and
               makes it to the cover of the far side.

                                     JACKSON
                         Dang!  That was close!

               Miller nods to Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Your turn.

               Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him
               very gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Zig-zag, change your pace a couple
                         times, you'll be alright.

               Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, I'm going to draw fire for
                         you.
                              (sternly)
                         But if I do, you goddamned well better
                         go.

               Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.

               CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks to Upham

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

               Upham nods, still terrified.

               MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN

               Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.

                                     MILLER
                         Go.

               Upham runs.

               A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.

               He doesn't budge.

               UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.

               REIBEN watches Upham run.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, that guy can move.

               A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to
               the far side.

               MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't
               even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.
               He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.

                                     SARGE
                              (under his breath so
                              only Miller can hear)
                         Damn fool.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, he's fast!

                                     MILLER
                              (glances at Sarge,
                              speaks to Reiben)
                         Glad of it.

                                     UPHAM
                         On the other side of the street,
                         crouches in a doorway with Jackson.
                         Upham is a bit in shock, less from
                         the nearness of the bullets than
                         from what Miller just did for him.

                                     MILLER
                         DASHES across the street.

               GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches
               behind him.

               HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Bring 'em over.

               UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

               Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         One at a time.

                                     MILLER
                         Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-
                         runs down the block.  He passes a:

                                     BOMBED OUT BUILDING
                         Out of the line of fire.  A dozen
                         dead American soldiers lined up on
                         the ground.  The battered, bloody
                         bodies, only partially covered by
                         ponchos.

               Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.
               Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees the dead and wounded, shows no
                         reaction.  Runs to:

                                     AN ALLEY
                         Captain Hamill and his men are bunched
                         there, out of the line of fire.
                         He's sending off a squad to continue
                         their door-to-door.

               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the
               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.

               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two
               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak
               familiarly.

               Captain hamill How was the road in?

                                     MILLER
                         We had a jeep until a few hours ago,
                         a nice one, it had a cute little
                         flag with a couple of stars on it.

               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.

               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.

                                     MILLER
                         We called in a strike on the eighty-
                         eights that took it out, but it's
                         the Kraut spotter that counts,
                         wherever the hell that bastard is.

               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.

               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying
               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying
               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant
               steeple.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson.

               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson
               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and
               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to
               his back.

               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and
               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
               unusual, long-barrel, rifle.

               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,
               along with Upham, watch curiously.

               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,
               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he
               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He
               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham
               is fascinated.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is that?

               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized
               shell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel
                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,
                         elevated three-glass scope and a
                         single-throw hammer.

                                     UPHAM
                         The Army gave you that?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep.

                                     UPHAM
                         You must be a hell a shot.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not where I come from.

               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.

               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the
               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight
               and waits, absolutely motionless.

                                     UPHAM
                         That must be four thousand yards.

                                     JACKSON
                              (without taking his
                              eye from the scope)
                         Forty-two-hundred, I figure.

                                     UPHAM
                         You take account of the wind?

               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
               back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,
               some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between
               Upham and Jackson.

                                     REIBEN
                              (put-on Southern accent)
                         Dang right, he take 'count of the
                         wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a
                         Kentucky windage?

               Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the
               trigger.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, how many time I got to tell
                         you, I'm from Tennessee.

                                     REIBEN
                         They got squirrels there, too, right?

               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart
               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them
               the St. Mere road is open.

               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to
               Miller.

               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?

                                     MILLER
                         Very far, they're not coming this
                         way, they're going to take Caen first.

               Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a
               lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it
               gets better.  How many men did you bring?

                                     MILLER
                         Five, but we not staying, we're on
                         our way to Ramelle.

               Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private
               Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, you know about that?

               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in
               with the early wounded or dead.

               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED
               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.

               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted
               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two
               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,
               they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.

                                     MILLER
                         Wonderful.

               Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the
               hell out of there before those Krauts show up.

                                     MILLER
                         How do we get out of here?

               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in
               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If
               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,
               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
               tomorrow night.

               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his
               head.

               Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?

               Miller shrugs.

               Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but
               I understand what you're doing?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?

               Captain hamill Good luck.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks.

               Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.

               Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful
               sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's find someplace to hole up.

               Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head
               of the alley, Miller passes Upham.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I'm sorry about what happened,
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         It was nothing.

                                     UPHAM
                         But you could have gotten killed and
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         Like I said, it was nothing.
                              (to the men)
                         Don't bunch up.

               He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham
               watches him go.

                                     UPHAM
                         Did you see what he did, back there?
                         He stepped right into the open, so I
                         could get across.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shit, that was no big deal.

                                     WADE
                         They can't kill him.

                                     SARGE
                         Like hell they can't.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade's right, it's some kind of
                         scientific, magnetic thing, I can't
                         explain it, but I've seen it.

                                     WADE
                         We all have, he's got nine lives, or
                         he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

               The men are equal parts joking and admiring.  Sarge is
               neither.

                                     SARGE
                         No one's bulletproof.  No one.
                              (beat)
                         C'mon, stay low.

               Sarge takes off after Miller.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

               Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins
               of a medieval church.  Miller, settled into a comfortable
               spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed.
               Reiben paces.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, could you please explain
                         the math of this mission to me?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, what do you want to know?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms,
                         since when does six equal one?  What's
                         the sense in risking six guys to
                         save one?

                                     MILLER
                         Ours is not to reason why.

                                     REIBEN
                         Huh?

                                     MILLER
                         Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick
                         up this kid, high-tail it back to
                         division, everything'll work out
                         fine.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'd much rather die in Caen than
                         Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, there's a fairly good chance
                         you're not going to die at all.

                                     REIBEN
                         Easy for you to say, sir.
                              (beat)
                         Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring
                         his fucking neck.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor
                         bastard's mother.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you
                         got a mother?

                                     JACKSON
                         Last I knew.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of
                         us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain
                         has a mother.

               Miller smiles.  Reiben eyes him and reconsiders.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, maybe not the Captain, but the
                         rest of us have mothers.

                                     MILLER
                         You have orders, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

                                     MILLER
                         I'd love to hear it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is
                         a serious misallocation of valuable
                         military resources.  Miller Go on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Well, sir, by my way a thinkin' I am
                         a finely made instrument of warfare.
                         What I mean by that is, if you was
                         to put me with this here sniper rifle
                         anywhere up to and includin' one
                         mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear
                         line of sight, war's over.

               Miller nods.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I want you to listen closely
                         to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe.
                         Jackson, continue.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that
                         the entire resources of the United
                         States Army oughta be dedicated to
                         one thing and one thing only, and
                         that is to put me and this here weapon
                         on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle
                         of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one
                         to question decisions made up on
                         high, sir, but it seems to me that
                         saving one private, no matter how
                         grievous the losses of his family,
                         is a waste of my God-given talent.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade?

                                     WADE
                         Hell, I don't mind this mission,
                         sir, as long as there's something up
                         at Ramelle for...

                                     REIBEN
                              (finishing Wade's
                              sentence)
                         ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah,
                         we heard that.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?

                                     UPHAM
                         Pass.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         I'm just here to keep a bunch of
                         numb-nuts, including one certain,
                         frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate,
                         from getting themselves killed.

               Reiben eyes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         And what about you, Captain?

               Miller looks at Reiben, shocked.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, what's the matter with you?
                         I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain.
                         There's a chain of command.  Griping
                         goes one way, up, only up, never
                         down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to
                         my superior officers.  Up, get it?
                         I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe
                         in front of you.  How long you been
                         in the army?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.
                              (beat)
                         But if you weren't a captain, or if
                         I were a major, what would you say?

               Miller considers his response.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case, I would say this is an
                         excellent mission, with an extremely
                         valuable objective, worthy of my
                         best efforts.

               Reiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no
               obvious sarcasm.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         In addition, as I pointed out earlier,
                         I have a fondness for cheese and I
                         hope to have the opportunity to sample
                         some of the Ramelle products, when
                         we arrive there, to see if they live
                         up to their excellent reputation.
                         Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
                         for the mother of Private James Ryan
                         and I'm more than willing to lay
                         down my life, and the lives of my
                         men, especially you, Reiben, to help
                         relieve her suffering.  The men
                         thoroughly enjoy the performance.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, if you were not a captain, I
                         would compliment you, now, for being
                         an excellent liar.

                                     MILLER
                         But I am a captain.  If I were not a
                         captain, I would thank you for the
                         compliment and tell you that the
                         ability to lie comes from being a
                         top-notch poker player, which I am,
                         having learned at the side of my
                         mother who is, by popular acclaim,
                         the best poker player in...

               The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're
               about to find out Miller's home town.  Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         ...my home town, which shall remain
                         un-named.

               The men ease back, disappointed.

                                     MILLER
                         Any further thoughts on the subject?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like
                         to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,
                         fuck the cheese capital of France
                         and while we're at it, fuck Private
                         James Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll make a note of your suggestions
                         but I'll leave that last one to you,
                         especially if he's already dead.

               The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets
               serious.

                                     MILLER
                         We move out in two hours, try and
                         get some sleep.

               The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all
               settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to
               follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange
               men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow
               suit.

               Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his
               flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,
               he studies his maps while his men rest.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER)

               Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson,
               Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his
               flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,
               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in
               Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.

                                     SARGE
                         You ever going to open those letters?
                         Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe.

                                     SARGE
                         It's not normal, not reading letters
                         from home.

                                     MILLER
                         Since when have things been normal?

                                     SARGE
                         You got me.  Afraid of bad news?

                                     MILLER
                         Nope.

                                     SARGE
                         Good news?

               Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of
               them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at
               the men.

                                     SARGE
                         You think they'll be alright?

                                     MILLER
                         They're fine.  As long as they can
                         gripe, they'll be alright.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about you?

               Miller considers the question, doesn't answer.

                                     MILLER
                         They guys here aren't going to be
                         able to hold out until battalion
                         shows up.

                                     SARGE
                         Nope.

                                     MILLER
                         Command isn't going to let them
                         withdraw and the Germans sure as
                         hell aren't going to let them
                         surrender.

                                     SARGE
                         Three for three.

                                     MILLER
                         If we stayed, we could make a
                         difference.

                                     SARGE
                         You're kidding yourself.

                                     MILLER
                         You never know.

               They sit in silence for a moment.

                                     SARGE
                         I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now you're the one kidding yourself.
                              (beat)
                         Hell of  a mission.

                                     SARGE
                         Yup, hell of a mission.

               Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Rise and shine, boys.  Let's go.

               Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their
               gear.

               EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT

               SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY
               BOOMS.  Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral
               toward the outskirts of town.  They're just a small squad,
               but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are
               very formidable-looking.

               EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

               Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill
               and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:

               A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON

               Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The
               AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the
               countryside like a tidal wave.

               Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.

               IT'S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE.  The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY
               is incredible, strange, other-worldly.

               EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.

               Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.

               MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.

               SARGE notices, says nothing.

               MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes
               go back to the BLAZING SKY.

                                     SARGE
                              (awe-struck)
                         Makes you feel small, doesn't it?

                                     MILLER
                         It doesn't take this.

               Upham's face shows more fear than awe.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wasn't made for this.

                                     MILLER
                              (bitterly)
                         You think the rest of us were?

               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns
               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a
               hold of himself and speaks gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect
                         you, this shit's gonna keep him up
                         all night, anyway.

               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for
               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, this ain't what they pay
                         us for.

               Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points
               the way.

               Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a
               gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until
               you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.

               As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to
               move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private
               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up
               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to
               Reiben.

               Gentle-faced private Here.

               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-
               ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's
               vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.

               Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at
               Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.

               Reiben takes the ammo.

                                     REIBEN
                              (gently)
                         Just what I need.

               Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands
               them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks, but you may need these more
                         than us, or Ryan.

               Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes
               the ammo back.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's move out.

               Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,
               lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill
               and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a
               strange bit of hope.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT

               The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The
               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way
               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside
               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.
               Sarge How long's your hand been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         A couple of weeks.  It started in
                         Portsmouth when they brought us down
                         for loading.

                                     SARGE
                         Is it getting worse?

                                     MILLER
                         No.  It comes and goes.  It stops
                         when I look at it.

                                     SARGE
                         You may have to find yourself a new
                         line of work, this one doesn't seem
                         to agree with you anymore.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll be alright.

               Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk
               on.

               EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)

               Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at
               point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge
               brings up the rear.

               A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate
               only with hand signals.

               JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.

               MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease
               into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY
               MEN appear.

               REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission
               to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them
               go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the
               bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of
               relief and lowers hi B.A.R.

               THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet
               from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed
               with fear.  The others are stone-faced.

               THE GERMANS PASS.

               MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.

               UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh
               of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing
               the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.

               UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly
               exposed.  Shitting bricks.

               Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad
               approaches.

               Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in
               the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-
               kneed, amazed that he's still alive.

               MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the
               rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries
               after Miller, staying close on his heels.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,
               parallel to a cart path.  Wary.

               Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
               other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and
               motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

               Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as
               Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional
               signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts
               away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn
               is visible.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it
                         up.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

               First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by
               the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five.

               Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at
               the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.
               The war is far away.

               Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together
               without speaking for a moment.

                                     MILLER
                         It looks like a Renoir.

                                     UPHAM
                         Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth
                         Symphony, The Normandy?

                                     MILLER
                         I've been humming it.

                                     UPHAM
                         I heard.

                                     MILLER
                         It seemed appropriate.

                                     UPHAM
                         You know classical music?

                                     MILLER
                         Some.

                                     UPHAM
                         Where are you from, Captain?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         What's the pool up to?

               Upham smiles, caught.

                                     UPHAM
                         Over three-hundred.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll tell you what, if I'm still
                         alive when it hits five-hundred,
                         I'll let you know and we'll split
                         the money.

                                     UPHAM
                         If that's the way you feel, why don't
                         we wait until it's up to a thousand.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't expect to live that long.

               Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five hundred, then.

               Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to
               feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself
               back into a commander and barks at Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, private.

               Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure
               him out, then he simply follows him.

               EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN

               The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by
               war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is
               lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,
               hundred of years old.

               Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They
               advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.
               An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to
               this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and
               a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a
               draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.
               A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with
               empty shell casings around his body.

               Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to
               Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks
               gently to him in French.

               The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands
               and translates.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five nights ago, he found this
                         paratrooper caught in a tree with a
                         broken leg.  The leg got infected.
                         Last night he went to Ville Cholet
                         to get a doctor.  The doctor refused
                         to come and when he got back, this
                         is what he found.  The Krauts must
                         have shown up while he was gone.

                                     MILLER
                         Did he see any sign of them?

               Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.

                                     UPHAM
                         No, but he heard firing, just east,
                         less that a kilometer.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank him and tell him we're sorry
                         about his loss.

               Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.
               Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.

               Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his
               hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last
               of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.

               The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the
               edge of the field.

               Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches
               and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.

               Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to
               some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with
               bullets.

               Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.

                                     WADE
                         Captain.

               Staying low, they join Wade who has found:

               TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS

               A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.

               MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON

               Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow.  The
               others crawl up behind them.

                                     MILLER
                         Where?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the shadow by those two trees.

                                     MILLER
                         My guess, too.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is it?

                                     MILLER
                         A machine gun.

               Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover
               of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, I've got an idea, let's go
                         around.

                                     MILLER
                         We can't leave it here.

                                     JACKSON
                         We left them eighty-eights.

                                     MILLER
                         They don't send planes to put out
                         machine guns.
                              (beat)
                         Two flank runners with surpressing
                         fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes
                         left has to be fast.

               Upham steels himself and steps forward.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.

                                     REIBEN
                         He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

               Miller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer.

                                     WADE
                         How fast?

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-four-five.

                                     WADE
                         Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty-
                         two flat.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade goes left.

               Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is
               impressed.

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-two flat?

               Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.

                                     WADE
                         I would have won the states if some
                         bastard hadn't tripped me in the
                         finals.

               Miller points the others to their firing positions.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         ten yards, either side.

               As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,
               out of earshot of the men.

                                     SARGE
                         Rule of thumb, Captain, says you
                         ought to detail this one, instead of
                         going yourself.

               Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?

                                     SARGE
                         How about I go right, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         How about you take your position?

               Sarge hesitates.

                                     SARGE
                         How about...?

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         How about you shut up and take your
                         position?

               Sarge nods.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near
               Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.

                                     UPHAM
                         Good luck, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got
                         five lives.

                                     UPHAM
                         The men said, nine.

                                     MILLER
                         What do they know?
                              (beat)
                         I had nine, but I feel through the
                         ice when I was seven, my brother
                         pulled me out.  Then I used one when
                         a grenade landed in my foxhole in
                         Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one
                         on the beaches, one on the cliffs
                         and two getting here.

                                     UPHAM
                         That only leaves three.

                                     MILLER
                         Plenty.

               Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

                                     WADE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now.

               MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.

               Onto opposite sides of the field.  Nothing happens for a
               moment.  Then:

               A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.  MURDEROUSLY LOUD.

               SHATTERING THE QUIET.

                                     IN THE NEST
                         A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING
                         THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE
                         8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon.
                         Four Germans in the nest, four more
                         outlying riflemen.

                                     MILLER
                         Takes the FIRST FIRE.  He HITS THE
                         DIRT.  The BULLETS SCREAM just over
                         him.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPRINTS
               WADE HITS THE DIRT

               The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.

               SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM

               Zero the machine gun.  FIRE fast as they can.  Their BULLETS
               THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND
               SPRINTS MILLER HITS THE DIRT

               Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.
                         No effect.  Pissed.  POPS THE CLIP.
                         SLAMS in another.  FIRES.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER

               He rises and runs.  Fast.  Almost to the far hedgerow.

                                     WADE
                         Ten more yards.  Too slow.  A deadly
                         row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward
                         him.

                                     MILLER
                         Makes it to the far side.  Scrambles
                         up the roots.  Dives through the
                         brush.

                                     WADE
                         On a slight rise.  Can't hit the
                         dirt.  A line of bullets.  Desperately
                         sprints.

               WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.
               Goes down.

               SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified.  FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.
                         Stumbles onto the path.  Rolls to
                         his feet, running.  Swings his
                         Thompson into firing position.  Racing
                         toward the nest.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         Tearing along the path.  Sees a German
                         rifleman.  FIRES A BURST.  CUTS HIM
                         DOWN.  Runs over the body without
                         breaking stride.

               SARGE STEPS INTO THE OPEN, INTENTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN
               FIRE from Miller.

               The GERMANS ZERO SARGE.  BULLETS THUD all around him.  Somehow
               he's not hit.

                                     MILLER
                         TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.  BLASTS his
                         Thompson.  CUTS DOWN two more German
                         riflemen.  Grabs a grenade.  Pulls
                         the pin.

                                     THE NEST
                         The Germans see Miller coming.  Wheel
                         from Sarge.  Too late.

                                     MILLER
                         THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES.

               THE GRENADE EXPLODES.  The four Germans in the nest are
               KILLED.

               SARGE hollers to the others.

                                     SARGE
                         HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                                     MILLER
                         Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another
                         BURST.  KILLS the last of the German
                         riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto
                         the field.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS

               See Miller running toward Wade.  They instantly RACE onto
               the field.

                                     WADE
                         Lies in the grass.  Holding his belly.
                         Astonished by the pain.

               ALL THE AMERICANS RUN

               Converging on Wade.  Miller points, and yells, without slowing
               down.

                                     MILLER
                         REIBEN, UPHAM, PERIMETER!  COVER!

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Stop instantly.  Turn toward the
                         perimeter of the field.

                                     SARGE
                         Roots through his medical kit as he
                         runs.  Dropping and scattering
                         inessentials behind him.

                                     WADE
                         Wide-eyed.  Not even writhing.  Too
                         much pain.

               MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE

               Throw themselves onto the ground next to him.  They both
               tear out sulfa-packs.  Sarge frantically fumbles.  Ripping
               one open.  Powder spills.

               REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.

                                     SARGE
                         Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.
                         Pours sulfa powder.

                                     MILLER
                         About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the
                         wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.

                                     MILLER
                         Damn it!

               Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.

                                     SARGE
                         Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.

                                     SARGE
                         Sulfa, more sulfa...

                                     WADE
                         Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller.
                         Sees him preparing the morphine shot.
                         They both know.

                                     WADE
                         Yeah...morphine...make it a
                         double...huh...Captain...?

                                     MILLER
                         SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.
                         Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine
                         straight to Wade's brain.  Motions
                         impatiently to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         More morphine, hurry up, come on,
                         come on...

                                     SARGE
                         Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa.
                         Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the
                         morphine.

                                     MILLER
                         Snatches the morphine from Sarge.
                         Quickly and efficiently prepares a
                         second shot.  He's done this before.

                                     REIBEN
                         On guard, glancing back.  Pissed
                         off.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     UPHAM
                         Freaked out.  Trying to keep his
                         eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.

                                     JACKSON
                         Watching.

                                     MILLER
                         Gives Wade the second shot.

                                     WADE
                         Feels the effects of the first shot.
                         He sees Upham and manages a pained
                         smile.

               WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,
               without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE
               DIES

               ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE

               UPHAM begins to weep.

               REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently
                         closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers
                         slightly as he unclips one of Wades
                         dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.
                         Sarge notices.

               Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men
               see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.

               Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,
               rises and picks up his Thompson.

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         That was no twenty-two flat.

               Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.

                                     MILLER
                         He lied.  Let's move out.

               Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men
               hesitate, then slowly follow him.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY

               A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel.
               The five G.I.'s walk, spread out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him,
                         just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-
                         bitch.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shut up, will you?

                                     REIBEN
                         You shut up, this is the most fucked
                         up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned
                         Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

                                     JACKSON
                         Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         The hell he didn't.

               Miller motions to them curtly.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep it down.

               They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,
               the men don't hear.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to find someplace to hole
                         up for a bit.

               Sarge looks at Miller closely.

                                     SARGE
                         You alright?

                                     MILLER
                         Let's just find someplace.

               EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY

               Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good
               hiding place.

                                     MILLER
                         Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.
                         I'm going to re-con.

               Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but
               there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.
               He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.

               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY

               Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The
               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,
               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for
               faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,
               as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,
               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller
               senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a
               thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.

                                     MILLER
                         What was the name of that kid at
                         Anzio, the one who got his face burned
                         off?

                                     SARGE
                         Vecchio.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember
                         his name, he was a good kid, remember
                         how he used to walk on his hands and
                         sing that song about the man on flying
                         trapeze?

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah.

                                     MILLER
                         You know why I'm such a good officer?
                         Because of my mother.  Have I ever
                         told you about her?

                                     SARGE
                         Bits and pieces.

                                     MILLER
                         She's the best poker player you ever
                         saw.  My father used to go to these
                         Saturday night games and lose his
                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him
                         an ultimatum, either she gets a
                         regular seat at the table or she
                         locks him in every Saturday night.
                         He squawked and so did his buddies
                         but after a while they gave in and
                         from the first night she sat down,
                         she never lost.  She could read those
                         cocky bastards like they were playing
                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her
                         eyes, the tone of her voice, her
                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
                         her coffee, she was a master.  She
                         won more money on shit hands than
                         anyone in the history of the game.
                         Every Saturday night, my father would
                         lose two, three hundred bucks and
                         she'd win it all back and then some.
                         And I'd stand there, glued to her
                         shoulder, from the time I was five
                         years old, watching every hand, every
                         move, studying how she did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's why I'm such a good officer,
                         I can look at a man's face and tell
                         you exactly what he's holding, and
                         if it's a shit hand, I know just
                         what cards to deal him.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about your own hand?

                                     MILLER
                         No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?
                         So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear
                         me apart when I'd get one of my men
                         killed, but what was I supposed to
                         do?  Break down in front of the ones
                         who were standing there waiting for
                         me to tell them what to do?  Of course
                         not, so I bluffed, and after a while,
                         I started to fall for my own bluff.
                         It was great, it made everything so
                         much easier.  Sarge Is that why your
                         hand's been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         It could be worse.  You know the
                         first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?
                         Lie to your men.

                                     SARGE
                         Oh, yeah?

                                     MILLER
                         Not in so many words, but they tell
                         you you can have all the firepower
                         in the world and if your men don't
                         have good morale, it's not worth a
                         damn.  So if you're scared or empty
                         or half-a-step from a Section Eight,
                         do you tell your men?  Of course
                         not.  You bluff, you lie.

                                     SARGE
                         And how do you bluff yourself?

                                     MILLER
                         Simple, numbers.  Every time you
                         kill one of your men, you tell
                         yourself you just saved the lives of
                         two, three, ten, a hundred others.
                         We lost, what, thirty-one on the
                         cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times
                         that number by putting out those
                         guns.  That's over three hundred
                         men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.
                         Then thousand.  Any number you want.
                         See?  It's simple.  It lets you always
                         choose mission over men.

                                     SARGE
                         Except this time, the mission IS a
                         man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's
                         Ryan?  If they're both standing in
                         front of me and I have to shoot one
                         or the other, how do I choose?  Look
                         at my hand, there it goes again.

                                     SARGE
                         John, I've got to tell you, I think
                         you're about used up.

                                     MILLER
                         I think you're right, Keith.

                                     SARGE
                         You want me to take over?

               The question helps Miller pull himself back together.  He
               looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.

                                     MILLER
                         No, but if I get any worse, you'll
                         have to relieve me.

                                     SARGE
                              (sighs)
                         Just what I want to do.

               They share a smile.

                                     MILLER
                         You know Wade was the eleventh of
                         the twelve, you're the last one still
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         I know.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't let yourself get killed, if
                         you do, they might make me give back
                         the medal and then I won't be able
                         to lip off to colonels anymore.

                                     SARGE
                         I'll do my best.

               They shake their heads at the madness of it all.  Miller
               Hell of a...

                                     (BEAT)
                         Ah, forget it.

               Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting
               himself.  He's about ninety-five percent there.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks for drawing that machine gun
                         off me.

                                     SARGE
                         You're welcome, John.

                                     MILLER
                         But, that's my personal brand of
                         stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary
                         about it, if you do it again, you're
                         busted.

               Sarge allows himself a slight smile.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back
               to the men.

               EXT. CLEARING - DAY

               The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.
               No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.
               Miller barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Up.  We're moving out.

                                     REIBEN
                         I thought you said we had an hour,
                         sir?

                                     MILLER
                         Well now I'm saying we're moving
                         out.  Get off your ass.

               The men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow.

                                     MILLER
                         What the hell's the matter with you,
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on
                         account of Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Who's Wade?

               No one responds.

                                     MILLER
                         I said, who the hell is Wade?

               The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand what you're doin',
                         but I respectfully request permission
                         to grieve in my own manner.

                                     MILLER
                         You'll grieve the way I tell you to
                         goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade,
                         there was one, but he died a long
                         time ago, he's been dead for so long
                         you can hardly remember his name,
                         you understand?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand.  I don't like it,
                         but I understand.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, now get your goddamned gear.

               The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.
               Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his
               head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit
               to work.  He knows they have no choice.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent,
               grim.

               EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY

               Miller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds
               up the map, points the way and they move out.

               EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY

               More progress.  The men are still grim.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what the best possible thing
                         that could happen is?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get
                         lockjaw, never say another word as
                         long as you live.

               Miller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         I've given this a lot of thought,
                         sir.  The best thing that could happen
                         is, we find Ryan and he's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Why's that?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, consider the possibilities.
                         A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take
                         him back to the beach.  Knowing you,
                         you don't let him carry my gear,
                         even though he really should, and we
                         all get killed, trying to keep him
                         alive.

                                     MILLER
                         Except for the last part, that one's
                         not bad.

                                     REIBEN
                         B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown
                         up by the German equivalent of Wade,
                         whose name I know you don't want me
                         to mention.  There's nothing to find.
                         The biggest piece is the size of a
                         pea.  We wander around, looking for
                         him until the Germans pick us off,
                         one after another.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't like that one.

                                     REIBEN
                         Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is
                         the worst one, we find Ryan and he's
                         wounded.  Not only does he not carry
                         my gear, we have to carry his gear.
                         And him.

                                     MILLER
                         But we accomplish the mission.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe.  But what if he dies on the
                         way back?  you see what I'm saying,
                         sir?  The best possible situation
                         is, he's dead, we find his body,
                         more or less intact, we grab one of
                         his dog-tags and high-tail it back
                         to the beach, or better yet, we head
                         over to Caen and catch up with
                         division.

                                     MILLER
                         Has anyone ever told you, you're
                         officer material?

                                     REIBEN
                         No, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         That's a mystery to me.

               No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

               The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush
               near the crossroads.  A sign reads:  "Ramelle 3 Km."  Miller
               folds up the map.

                                     SARGE
                         Looks like we're going to beat those
                         Kraut companies to Ramelle.

               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something
               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they
               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't think so.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop
               trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack
               Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a
               bridge.

               CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL

               Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
               Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.

                                     GERMAN FLANK SQUADS
                         Hurry along the fields on either
                         side of the road, trying to keep up
                         with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS
                         MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching
                         German Flank Squad.  They flatten
                         themselves into the mucky water.
                         Ready their weapons.  Prepare to
                         fire.

                                     THE GERMAN SQUAD
                         Approaches the bridge.

               PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES

               See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.

                                     MILLER
                         Is just about to open up on them.

                                     THE GERMAN SERGEANT
                         Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind
                         and CALLS to them.

                                     THE GERMAN PRIVATES
                         Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the
                         convoy.

                                     IN THE CULVERT
                         The Americans breathe again.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wonder where they're going.

                                     MILLER
                         Same place we are.

               Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast
               is clear.  They head out.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY

               A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,
               cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone
               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.

               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the
               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.

               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD

               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Scans the Germans with his binoculars.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like tea time, maybe they're
                         Brits.

                                     UPHAM
                         I sure hope so.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think they're waiting
                         for, Captain?

               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more
               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER
               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know
               that sound, they don't like it.

               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS

               Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who
               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,
               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two
               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and
               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.
               There are four of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Puts away the binoculars and jerks
                         his head for his men to follow, low,
                         along the wall.  The men are happy
                         to do so, looking back nervously at
                         the German tanks.

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY

               The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is
               a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell
               casings and bodies, German and American and a few French
               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons
               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging
               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of
               the firing.

               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He
               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the
               firing.

               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY

               A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC
               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near
               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of
               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings
               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.
               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on
               both sides of the bridge.

               MILLER AND HIS MEN

               Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the
               bridge.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like they've been having a
                         hell of a party, here, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

               A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF
                         A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?

               Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty.

                                     MILLER
                         I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE
                         COME.
                              (to his men)
                         Cover me.

                                     REIBEN
                         What if our guys open up, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         You're only allowed to shoot at
                         Germans, that's one of the rules.

                                     REIBEN
                         Have it your way, Captain.

               Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward
               the bridge.

               THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP

               Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         POUR FIRE at the German positions,
                         SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.

                                     ON THE BRIDGE
                         The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM
                         OF BULLETS at the German positions.

               Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive
               jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.

               He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the
               young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are
               some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller
               catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to
               nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll keep it in mind.
                              (calls to Sarge)
                         OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.

               Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as
               they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.

               Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to
               hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days.

                                     MILLER
                         Things are tough all over.  We're
                         looking for a Private James Ryan.

               Forrest Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Is he here?

               Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.

               Forrest Go get Ryan.

                                     (TO MILLER)
                         What do you want him for, sir?

               Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and
               scrambles to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson, get a hold of command.

               Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to
               Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         How many men do you have?

               They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men
               to leap over the barricade.

               Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge
               was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
               ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

               Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's
               hailing I.D.   No response.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep trying.

               Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

               Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:

                                     PRIVATE JAMES RYAN
                         Dashing from cover to cover, making
                         his way toward them.  Ryan is an
                         American classic, nineteen years
                         old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.
                         Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and
                         smeared with dirt and blood, he's
                         very alive.  His eyes shine, his
                         face has a spark.  You can't help
                         but love this kid.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         All watch Ryan run toward them.

                                     JACKSON
                         So, that's Ryan.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
               barricade.  He salutes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see
                         me?

               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally
               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,
               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.
               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers
               have been killed in action.

               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.
               Somehow he remains upright.

               Ryan All three?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes.

               Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning
               him against some sandbags.

                                     THE PARATROOPERS
                         Are stunned at the news.  They look
                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they
                         can do.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         Also look at Ryan, but then, one
                         after another, they turn away,
                         adverting their eyes, looking a their
                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,
                         the sky, anything other than Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         We've been sent to get you out of
                         here.  You're going home.

               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and
               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a
               little room.

               Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm
                         taking you and your men with me.

               Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this
               bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-
               ninth Division.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.

               Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm not going to leave you and your
                         men here to get killed.  Get them
                         together, we're moving out.

               A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.

                                     RYAN (O.S.)
                         No, sir.

               They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about
               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on
               the arm and speaks softly to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Come on, Private, you're going home.

               Ryan jerks away from Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         No, sir.

               All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.

                                     MILLER
                         Private.  I'm sorry about your
                         brothers but staying here and getting
                         yourself killed isn't going to help.

                                     RYAN
                         Sir, if the Krauts are holding this
                         bridge when division shows up, our
                         guys are going to be sitting ducks.

                                     MILLER
                         This bridge cannot be held.  The
                         Germans have two companies less than
                         three miles from here.  They have
                         tanks.

               That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,
               but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.

               Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.

                                     MILLER
                         Private, if you want to commit
                         suicide, that's your choice, but
                         you're going to have to wait until
                         after I get you back to the beach.
                         And you're not going to take these
                         men with you.

               Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm not leaving, sir.

               Miller starts to boil over.

                                     MILLER
                         The hell you aren't, you're comin'
                         with me if I have to drag you every
                         inch of the way.  You hear me,
                         Private?

                                     RYAN
                         I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

               Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't
               resist.

                                     MILLER
                         Listen you little son-of-a-bitch
                         you're coming with me or
                         I'll...I'll...

               Ryan speaks softly.

                                     RYAN
                         What are you going to do, sir, shoot
                         me?

               Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind
               Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Uh, excuse me, Captain.

               Miller slowly turns and glares.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         So, what are a few tanks, sir?

               Miller's more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         He's right, we can't shoot him...well,
                         we could but we'd get in an enormous
                         amount of trouble.  And he's right
                         about the bridge, it's a hell of a
                         lot more important than he is.

               JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n...?

               Miller turns his glare on Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                              (continuing)
                         Seems to me, we got us a opportunity,
                         here, to kill two birds with one
                         stone.  Command seems to think keepin'
                         this boy alive is worth somethin'.
                         If we was to do that and hold this
                         bridge, good chance we'd get us a
                         bucket full of medals.  I might even
                         get me one 'a them big, fancy ones
                         like you got, so's I could sass any
                         officer in the whole dang army, you
                         included.

               Miller does a slow burn.

               UPHAM STEPS FORWARD

                                     UPHAM
                         I'd like to stay, too, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         You don't count.

               SARGE STEPS UP

                                     SARGE
                         I do and personally, I'd rather get
                         the hell out of here, but somebody's
                         got to stay and take care of you and
                         these pin-head privates of yours.

               Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.

               Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir.

               Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                         See, Captain?  The vote's unanimous.

               Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote?
               What the hell are you talking about?  We don't vote.  This
               isn't a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you
               follow them.  We don't vote!

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely
                         speaking hypothetically.  IF this
                         was a voting situation, then the
                         vote would have been unanimous.  But
                         of course, it's not a voting
                         situation, you're the captain, and
                         you give the orders, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         You're goddamned right, I give the
                         order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen
                         to me, you little pissant pieces of
                         shit, I am the ranking officer here
                         and what I say goes, is that clear?

               They all quickly nod.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Of course, sir.

               All the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

               Miller looks from face to face.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case...
                              (beat)
                         I vote we stay.

               That's what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn't give them
               time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson,
                         get up on the bridgekeepers hut with
                         your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and
                         Upham move that machine gun so it
                         can cover the left flank, it's
                         worthless where it is.  Forrest, I
                         want a full inventory of all your
                         weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go.

               They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller
               for a moment.

                                     RYAN
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                              (gruffly gentle)
                         Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next
                         to me, no matter where I go, you
                         understand?

               Ryan salutes.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright, come with me.

               Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check
               the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

               Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other
               paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.

               Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon
               grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy
               guns and about sixty rounds per man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's it?

               Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, can I change my vote?

               Miller sighs, worried.

               EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT - DAY

               Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a
               crescent of sandbags.  His eye is at his scope.  He FIRES.

                                     A GERMAN SNIPER
                         Falls from a window on the edge of
                         town, dead.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sits beside Jackson with a pair of
                         binoculars, searching for another
                         target.  The German sniper fire has
                         subsided for now.  Ext. bridge - day
                         Miller watches as Ryan and several
                         other paratroopers dig a series of
                         trenches across the street, leading
                         to the bridge.

               Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.

               Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head.  He speaks
               to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, see what you can do to make
                         those buildings inhospitable.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE
               DISTANCE.  They all turn at the sound.

                                     UPHAM
                         Eighty-eights, right?

               Miller nods.

                                     UPHAM
                         I can tell what the gunners had for
                         dinner.

                                     MILLER
                         Those guns are close.

               Forrest Just south of town.  The Krauts have a two gun
               emplacement, we saw it on the way in.  That's how we knew
               they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out
               of us.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope they don't change their
                         mind.

               Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.

               INT. BUILDING - DAY

               Within sight of the bridge.  Sarge carefully plants a wire-
               triggered satchel charge at the door of the building.  He
               sets the wire, then carefully backs away.

               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

               Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine
               gun nest.  Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham
               at his side.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think?

                                     MILLER
                         Well, if we had ten times the men
                         and a lot more ammo, we might stand
                         a chance, but not against those tanks.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we going to do?

                                     MILLER
                         We're going to hope like hell the
                         tanks were on their way somewhere
                         else.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe Caen.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope, because we're sure as
                         hell not going to do any damage to
                         them with what we have here.

                                     UPHAM
                         What about our grenades?

                                     MILLER
                         Those are Tigers, they have six-inch
                         armor, they don't even notice
                         grenades.

                                     UPHAM
                         Would they notice and eighty-eight?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, you got one?

                                     UPHAM
                         The Germans do.

               Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, go find Jackson, he and I are
                         going hunting.

               Upham runs off.  Sarge shakes his head.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, oh.

                                     MILLER
                         Out of the mouth of babes.

               EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT

               Dark.  Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with
               blackening soot.  The rest of Miller's men and several
               paratroopers, including Ryan, look on.  Upham is distressed.
               Upham It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, you've got to learn the
                         difference between whining and
                         griping.  You can't just rely on
                         natural ability, you've got to study
                         and practice.

                                     UPHAM
                         But, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         There you go again, that's whining,
                         that's not okay.

                                     UPHAM
                         Goddamn it, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         That's better, but you've still got
                         a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben,
                         he's a natural and works at it, he'll
                         give you some pointers.

                                     REIBEN
                         Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have
                         him pissing and moaning with the
                         best of us.

                                     MILLER
                         See to it.

               RYAN Steps up to Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'd like to go, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         No, private, I want you to stay here,
                         keep your head down, don't do anything
                         brave or stupid.

                                     REIBEN
                         Aren't they the same thing, sir?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I don't know what I'd do
                         without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close
                         to you and alive.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         You ready?

               Forrest Yes, sir.

                                     JACKSON
                         You betcha, sir.

               Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out.

                                     REIBEN
                              (southern accent)
                         Y'all come back.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the
                         way I talk?

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy southern accent)
                         Hell, no!

               Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest
               into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the
               night.  It's eight-man crew re-loads.

                                     IN THE DARKNESS
                         A slight movement.  It's Miller.  He
                         crawls to the edge of the emplacement
                         and freezes in the shadows.

               A moment later he's joined by Forrest.  A moment after that,
               Jackson silently crawls up to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a
                         weakness.  There is none.  He motions
                         to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The
                         three of them settle into the
                         darkness.

               EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan
               is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller's
               men eye him.

                                     SARGE
                         Private, I'm sorry about your
                         brothers.

               Ryan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip
               from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was
               the name of the guy who got killed coming up here?

                                     SARGE
                         Wade.

                                     RYAN
                         Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here
                         to keep me alive...I never met
                         him...he didn't know me from Adam,
                         strange.  What was he like?

                                     SARGE
                         A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben,
                         here, used to call him a happy idiot.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell, I did.

                                     RYAN
                         My brothers would be mighty pissed
                         off at me, if they knew I let some
                         guy get killed trying to keep me
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         You didn't let anybody get killed,
                         you didn't even know we were coming
                         up here.

                                     RYAN
                         Sure, I know, but...
                              (sighs)
                         Goddamn it all...

               The others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               Dark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch.

                                     A SHADOW
                         It's Miller.  Easing through the
                         darkness.  Closer to one of the
                         sentries.

               Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller
               nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the
               sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS.

                                     BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.

                                     A GERMAN SENTRY
                         Approaches.  He sees Forrest.  Just
                         as he's about to open up with his
                         sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him
                         from behind, STABS him, eases the
                         body silently to the ground.

                                     MILLER AND JACKSON
                         Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.

               Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the
               German's truck.

                                     ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY
                         Rounds a corner.  Sees them.  OPENS
                         UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.

               Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.

                                     OTHER GERMANS
                         Race over, FIRING.

                                     JACKSON
                         Covering them, OPENS UP.  Kills the
                         advancing Germans.

               MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.

               FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.

               JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.

               Spins.

               Still FIRING.

               Giving Miller cover.

               MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.

               JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.

               JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.

                                     THE WINDSHIELD
                         Is shattered by bullets.

               Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.

                                     FORREST
                         In the back of the truck.

               Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.

               MILLER FLOORS IT.

               The truck DRIVES through the Germans.

               The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.
               MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST Drive into the night.

               The Germans FIRING after them.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a
               gauntlet of Germans.  As they approach the bridge, the other
               American's FIRE COVER for them.

               Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.

               SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS

               THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the
               barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         RYAN!  GET BACK THERE!

               Ryan ignores him.  They get the eighty-eight safely behind
               the barricade.  Miller grabs Ryan.

                                     RYAN
                         Sorry, sir.

               Miller fumes.  he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging,
               clearly not pissed at Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't do that again.

                                     RYAN
                         I won't need to sir, it's already
                         here, behind the barricade so...

               Miller GROWLS.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine.  Very
               gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt.  They cover it and
               step back carefully.

               Then they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their
               tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll
               place the rest of the mines.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Quiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There's nothing to do
               now but wait.

               ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT

               Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see
               Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning
               the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.

                                     REIBEN
                         What do you think?

                                     JACKSON
                         I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

                                     REIBEN
                         I mean, Ryan, what do you think of
                         him?

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't half-bad, I guess.

                                     REIBEN
                         I guess.

               They're quiet for a moment.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         Nope, he ain't Wade.

               Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs through the shadows and
                         stops at the bridgekeepers hut.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben...

               Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun
               nest.

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir.

               REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.

               MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in
               the rear machine gun nest.

                                     MILLER
                         You set?  Sarge nods.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to
               check the others.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN

               First light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE
               them in their positions:

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Manning the forward machine gun nest.

                                     JACKSON
                         Behind the sandbags, on top of the
                         bridgekeeper's hut.

               FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS

               Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward
               and the rear machine gun nests.

                                     RYAN AND SARGE
                         Manning rear machine gun.

                                     MILLER
                         At the bridgehead, waiting.

               SOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD

               All eyes turn.

               SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER

               Dashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant.
               Then another.  And another.

                                     MILLER
                         Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down
                         behind some sandbags.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE THEY COME!

               A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.

               THE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE

                                     REIBEN
                         OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         At least fifty of them, advancing on
                         the bridge.  Running from cover to
                         cover.  A squad pushing a French
                         truck, using it as a shield.

                                     JACKSON
                         Calmly picking off the attacking
                         Germans.

                                     THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN
                         Make their way down the streets.
                         Along the riverbank.  Through the
                         houses.  There are GERMANS FIRING
                         from all directions.

               REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off.
                         Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Running out of ammo.  See that there's
                         nothing else they can do.

                                     REIBEN
                         Time to go.

               Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.
               Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as
               they can.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER

               REIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up.
               Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him.

               They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.

               DIVE OVER.  The Germans are almost on them.

                                     RYAN IS FIRING
                         With the rear MACHINE GUN.  Drops
                         several Germans.

                                     GERMANS EVERYWHERE
                         They swarm over the first barricade.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES A BURST into a German's belly.
                         HITS another with the stock of his
                         Thompson.

               HAND-TO-HAND.

               FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

               FIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a
               flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks.  Two of
               the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.  THE
               PARATROOPERS see the grenades.  Too late.

               THE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER
               PARATROOPERS RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE

               No time to react.

                                     HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING
                         Half a dozen Germans break through.

               Miller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST.

                                     RYAN
                         Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES.
                         KILLS the German.

                                     MILLER
                         Struggling with a pair of Germans.

                                     JACKSON
                         FIRES.  Drops one of the Germans on
                         Miller with a head shot.  Cuts open
                         Miller's face with bits of skull.

                                     RYAN
                         Leaps onto the final German attacking
                         Miller.  That German raises his rifle
                         on Ryan.

               UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON

               All see it.  SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.

                                     THE STUNNED GERMAN
                         About to kill Ryan.  Torn apart by
                         bullets from three directions.

                                     UPHAM
                         I got him.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell you did, I got him.

                                     JACKSON SMILES
                         He got him.

               MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip.  FIRES an arc.  DROPS four
               Germans.  Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS.  BARKS to Reiben
               and Upham:

                                     MILLER
                         BACK!  LET'S GO!

               They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make
               it to the barricade.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees them in deep trouble.  Leaves
                         Ryan firing the rear machine gun.
                         Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING
                         COVER.  Exposed.

                                     BULLETS EVERYWHERE
                         MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the
                         barricade.  Dive over.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees they've made it.  FIRES A FINAL
                         BURST.  Races for cover.  A trail of
                         bullets right behind him.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth.  Trying to
               cover Sarge.  Too many Germans.

               SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK.  FALLS.  MILLER AND THE OTHERS
               continue to fire, horrified.

               SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET

               Cradling the B.A.R.  Stumbling toward cover.  Slowing.
               Bleeding.

                                     THE AMERICANS
                         Desperately trying to cover him.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Open up with a volley.

                                     SARGE
                         Is almost there.

               ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE

               As best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It's not enough.

                                     SARGE
                         Five feet from the sandbags, his
                         back is TORN APART by Germans fire.
                         He looks down, stunned at his chest.
                         Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An
                         instant of surprise, more than fear.

               He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls
               onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies.
               THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Who killed Sarge are killed.  The
                         others back off for now.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the
                         barricade.  Sees that he's dead.

               THE GERMANS RETREAT.

               Around the corner.

                                     MILLER
                         Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling
                         next to him.

                                     THE OTHERS
                         Watch, start to gather.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Get back to your positions!

               They hesitate.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

               They follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn't move.
               He can't take his eyes off Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Doesn't move.  He just stares at
                         Sarge's body.

                                     RYAN
                         Looks at Miller, sees him growing
                         weak, starting to sway.  He gently
                         tries to move Miller aside.

                                     RYAN
                         I'll take care of Sarge...

               Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller
               grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made
               as he kneeled over Wade's body.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?  Who's Sarge?

               But this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The
               hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's
               called his own bluff.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Dark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once.

               Waiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have
               tightened their perimeter.

               Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously.

               They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper.

               Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:

                                     MILLER
                         English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania.

               Slowly, Miller's men turn to him.

                                     UPHAM
                         What'd you say, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I teach English at Addley High School
                         in Addley, Pennsylvania.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Like hell, you did.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, what about our deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I changed my mind.

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I coach the baseball team, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         No kiddin'?

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     UPHAM
                         Forget it.

               They all sit in silence.

                                     MILLER
                         You know that cruise ship Wade's
                         grandfather was on?

               They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's
               talking about.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         I wonder if his cabin is still
                         available?

                                     REIBEN
                         That's not where I am.  Miller No?
                         Where are you?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm in a dressing room with Mrs.
                         Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife.
                         She's an easy forty-four, double E,
                         but I've convinced her she's a thirty-
                         eight D and I'm watching her try and
                         squeeze herself into a side-stay,
                         silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle
                         with s Helf-lift brassiere.
                              (smiles)
                         She's having a devil of a time,
                         getting into that thing.

               They all share Reiben's dream for a moment.  Then Jackson
               smiles.

                                     JACKSON
                         Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy,
                         it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and
                         we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a
                         flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...

                                     REIBEN
                         Jackson, how many times I got to
                         tell you, you're from Tennessee.

                                     JACKSON
                         I am, but I like imported whiskey.
                         So there I am and I hear the biggest
                         ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a
                         rustlin' right there in front of me.
                         That ole' boy comes right out of the
                         brush, I got a clear shot and he
                         knows he's 'bout to meet his maker.
                         I aim, I got my finger tight on the
                         trigger and then I just smile and
                         say to that ole' coon, go on, now,
                         you get out 'a here.  Then I sit
                         down on a hollow log and take me a
                         right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

               Upham smiles.

                                     UPHAM
                         I don't know, I kind of like Wade's
                         idea about the cruise ship.  I've
                         never been to Tahiti.

                                     REIBEN
                         What about you, Captain?

               Miller smiles.  He knows exactly where he is.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm in my backyard, lying in my
                         hammock, with my arm around my wife,
                         listening for the sound of breaking
                         glass.

                                     JACKSON
                         Say what, Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         You see, I've got the best house in
                         all of Addley.  It's not the biggest
                         house, but it's got the best location,
                         right next to the junior high baseball
                         field.  The garage windows face left
                         field.  The guy who owned the house
                         before me had these heavy screen S
                         put over them.  The first thing I
                         did when I bought the place was take
                         off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-
                         two yards from home plate to my garage
                         windows.  It takes a hell of a junior
                         high kid to hit a ball that far.  I
                         look at my garage windows as a
                         Motivator and a way to scout the
                         kids coming up, the ones who are
                         going to give us a shot at the state
                         championship.  I lay there in my
                         hammock and every time I hear the
                         sound of breaking glass, I know we're
                         one step closer to winning it all.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't that get kind of expensive,
                         Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         It's worth it.

                                     JACKSON
                         To each, his own.

               They're all silent for a moment.  Then Miller turns to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         How about you, James?

               Ryan sighs.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm home, playing basketball with my
                         brothers, it's evenin' time, we're
                         trying' to get in a few more points
                         before it's too dark to see the ball.
                         That's where I am.

               They all nod.  Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes
               it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on.  They all
               eat in silence.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN

               First light.  Lovely.  Dew shimmers.  A ground fog drifts.
               A SOUND.  Louder.  And louder.  A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES
               toward the village.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAWN

               All are awake.  At their positions.  Waiting.

                                     MILLER
                         Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF
                         THE TANK.  Barely has time to react.
                         Sees:

               THE GERMANS ADVANCING AGAIN

                                     MILLER
                         Here they come.

                                     REIBEN
                         FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

               THE GERMANS KEEP COMING

               Lots of them.  Moving from cover to cover.  FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         Manning the forward machine gun.
                         Way out front.  Sees that he's going
                         to be cut off.  He grabs the hot
                         gun.  The barrel burns into his flesh.
                         He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK
                         toward the bridge.

               HE DIVES over the sandbags.  barely makes it.  TRAILED BY
               BULLETS.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions near the bridge.
                         Moving in.  FIRING.  Overwhelming.
                         They're everywhere.

                                     THREE GERMANS
                         Break through the perimeter.

               RYAN SHOOTS one.  GRAPPLES with the other two.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one
                         German.  STABS the other.

               RYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt.

               REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE
               GUN.

               OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A
               LONG BURST.  Germans drop.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES again.  More Germans drop.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions in the building near
                         the bridge.

               They start working their way to the tops of the nearby
               buildings.

               Making their way along the riverbanks.

                                     REIBEN AND RYAN
                         Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding
                         the ammo belt.

                                     REIBEN
                         MORE AMMO!

                                     UPHAM
                         Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He
                         grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS
                         toward Reiben and Ryan.

               SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM

               OPEN UP on him.

               BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there.

                                     UPHAM
                         TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart.
                         Stumbles the final few steps to the
                         machine gun nest.  Falls on the
                         sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the
                         ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD.

               RYAN STUNNED.

               For just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN
               FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the
               one almost out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the
                         advancing Germans.

               THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK

                                     MILLER
                         Knows what that means.  He hears the
                         RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.

                                     MILLER
                         TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME!

                                     RYAN AND REIBEN
                         Immediately grab the machine gun and
                         ammo and race back to the rear nest.

               Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST
               TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two
               German infantry platoons.

                                     JACKSON
                         On the bridgekeeper's hut.  Picking
                         off German soldiers who follow the
                         tank.

               A GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON.  Hollers into the tanks
               voice-tube.

                                     THE TANK
                         Stops.  Grinds its gears.  Turning
                         it's turret towards the bridgekeepers
                         hut.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON!

                                     JACKSON
                         Knows what's coming but he holds his
                         position, continuing to pick off
                         German soldiers.

                                     THE TANK BLASTS
                         THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON
                         ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         SEE JACKSON DIE.  A bare moment to
                         react.  Then, they turn their
                         attention back to the eighty-eight.
                         Frantically turning the aiming cranks.
                         Lowering the barrel to point blank.

               TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               Which can fire first.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Win the race.

                                     FIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         BLAST THE LEAD TANK DESTROY IT IN A
                         SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Quickly reload the eighty-eight.
                         FIRE AGAIN.

               DESTROY THE SECOND TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech
                         of the eighty-eight.  Pats Ryan on
                         the back.  Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE.

               RUNS down the bridge.  Right toward the two advancing tanks.

                                     RYAN
                         FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               DESTROYING THE THIRD TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Races through the debris.  Trailed
                         by BULLETS.

                                     REIBEN
                         With the machine gun.  Covers Miller.
                         Keeping most of the German infantry
                         down.

               RYAN jumps behind the second machine gun.  Opens up.  Helping
               to cover Miller.

               THE LAST GERMAN TANK

               Turret spins.  Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.
               Ready to blow him to bits.

                                     MILLER
                         Is almost there.  He arms the satchel
                         charge.

               THE TIGER'S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.

               BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS

                                     MILLER
                         Throws the satchel charge under the
                         tank.  Rolls off the edge of the
                         bridge.  Lands on the embankment
                         below.

               THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES

               MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.

               Almost out of ammo.

               MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge,
               hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!

               Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.

               A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard
               yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Goddamn it!

                                     REIBEN
                         More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them
                         The fear on their faces turns to
                         resignation.  They know that they
                         are dead men.  They settle into their
                         positions, and prepare to fire and
                         die.

               They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

               THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a
               smile...then a real smile...

               AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise.  Then
               ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...

               MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN

               Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along
               with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.

               They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after
               wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a
               few among the departing Germans.

                                     THE ADVANCING TROOPS
                         Run onto the bridge and start to
                         secure the position.  A SERGEANT and
                         a few of HIS MEN look around,
                         curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and
                         Ryan, battered and bloody, standing
                         among the bodies.

               A MAJOR strides up.

               Major Report, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,
                         that's Private Richard Reiben and
                         that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-
                         and-First Airborne.

               The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Ryan?

               One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

               Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.

               The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

               Major Command is looking for you, son.  You're going home.

               Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.

               EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY

               American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the
               road and over the bridge.

               MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN

               Watch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies
               of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers
               are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.

               Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if
               they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by
               any of the advancing troops or vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down
                         next to Sarge and looks at him for a
                         long moment.  Then, with a steady
                         hand, he takes one of Sarge's two
                         dog-tags.  Then he does the same to
                         Jackson and Upham.

               REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands and walks back to Reiben and
                         Ryan.  He hands the dog-tags to Ryan
                         who grips them tightly and nods in
                         thanks.

               Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then
               he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let's move out.

               Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller
               down the road, away from the bridge.

                                     CAMERA CRANES UP
                         The three dirty, bloodied, tired men
                         walk down the road, ignored by the
                         fresh troops marching in the opposite
                         direction.

                                     RYAN
                         Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, Private.

                                     RYAN
                         Upham and Jackson, what were they
                         like?

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was
                         writing a book.

                                     RYAN
                         Yeah?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the
                         220 in twenty-four-five.

                                     RYAN
                         No kidding.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,
                         he was going to be a preacher, his
                         father and uncles have a traveling
                         ministry out of the back of a stretch
                         Hudson.

                                     RYAN
                         And Sarge?

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?
                              (beat)
                         He was the best friend I ever had.
                              (smiles)
                         Lemme tell you about Sarge...

               They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds
               and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the
               road and over the bridge.

               Fade out.

               THE END -

               CREDITS:  White lettering over a back background.  The
               THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The
               power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back
               the hair and rattles the ears.

               The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING.
               Huge fifteen inch guns.

               SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT

               Heads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from
               German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the
               beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers,
               pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.

                         At the far end of the beach, a ninety-
                         foot cliff.  Topped by bunkers.
                         Ringed by fortified machine gun nests.
                         A clear line-of-fire down the entire
                         beach.

                         Make their way toward the base of
                         the cliffs.  Running a gauntlet of
                         explosions.

                         STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows
                         through the waves.

               THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN

               Boys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough.
               Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them.

               A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT

               A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT

               The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them.
               FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into
               the bow.

               THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS

               BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes
               the controls.

                                     A YOUNG SOLDIER
                         His face covered with the remains of
                         the motorman.  Starts to lose it.
                         Begins to shudder and weep.  His
                         name is DeLancey.

               THE BOYS AROUND HIM

               Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects
               them.  It starts to spread.

                                     A FIGURE
                         Pushes through the men.  Puts himself
                         in front of DeLancey.

               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far
               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,
               powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a
               cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
               helmet and lights the cigar.

               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
               terrified.

               Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?

               Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

               Delancey Oh, Jesus...

               Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your
               left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for
               those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're
               not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage
               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the
               cheek and moves on to the bow.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL
                         IN FRONT OF THEM.

               PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND

               It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none
               of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it
               belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his
               eyes back to the objective.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH

               The six surviving boats alongside.

               EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE

               From the landing crafts.  Arc toward the top of the cliffs.

               THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN

               A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft.  A dozen
               men are INSTANTLY KILLED.  Among them, DeLancey.

                                     MILLER
                         Somehow survives.  Jumps into the
                         breakers.

                                     MILLER
                         MOVE, GODDAMN IT!  GO!  GO!  GO!

                                     EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE

                         GRENADES.

                         Struggle through the surf.  FIRING
                         up as best they can.  Making for the
                         base of the cliffs.

               INCENDIARY GRENADES, HURLED FROM ABOVE,

               EXPLODE, SPREADING FIRE

                                     MILLER
                         Ignores the EXPLOSIONS and BULLETS.
                         Uses hand signals and curt orders.

                                     MILLER
                         THERE!  THERE!  HOOKS THERE!  FIRE
                         SQUAD, THOSE ROCKS!

                                     THE MEN
                         Obey instantly.  Set the grappling
                         hooks.  Take position.  Return fire.

               THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE

               Drown out most voices.  Except the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED
               AND DYING.

                                     THE MEN
                         Know what they have to do.  Start up
                         the ropes.  Into the teeth of the
                         German defenders.

                                     MILLER
                         Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine
                         gun.  Starts climbing with the first
                         group.

                                     THE CLIFF FACE
                         The Americans swarm up the ropes.
                         Taking turns firing up at the Germans.

               MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER

               A soft-faced boy.  Grabs him by the back of his collar.
               Roughly yanks him up.  Nearly choking him.  They boy climbs
               on.

                                     HALF-WAY
                         An American private is HIT.  FALLS,
                         taking two others with him.  All
                         three land on the rocks below.
                         Another way to die.

                                     NEAR THE TOP
                         Less steep.  They leave the ropes.
                         Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.

                                     MILLER
                         Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men.
                         Others bottleneck behind them.  Miller
                         scans the route and the defenders.

               Sees an open gap.  Deadly.  Beyond is a protective overhang.
               With a clear line to the top.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the route.

               Miller motions to six men huddled near him.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Take an instant to get ready.  Then
                         SCRAMBLE into the gap.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               Do their best to cover them.  POUR FIRE up at the Germans.
               Bad angle.  No Germans are hit.

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN
                         FIRE.  All KILLED.  They fall to the
                         rocks below.

               SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and
               best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.

               Sarge That's a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         It's the only way.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns to the next half-dozen men.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU'RE NEXT!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Move to the head of the gap.  Miller
                         moves for a better angle against the
                         machine guns.  Calls to JACKSON, a
                         tall, gangly Southern country boy,
                         sharp-shooter.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,
                         WILL YOU?

                                     JACKSON
                              (heavy Southern accent)
                         You betcha, Captain.

               Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.
               Turns to the second six.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Take deep breaths.  Head into the
                         gap.

               MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE

               JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.
               SARGE gets one.  Not enough.

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are
                         KILLED.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns, looking for the next six.
                         His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN
                         who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker.
                         Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy Brooklyn accent)
                         Captain, can I put in for a transfer?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start
                         the paperwork.

                                     THE THIRD SIX
                         Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller
                         exchange a look.  They both see the
                         madness of what they're doing.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               OPEN UP on the Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     SARGE
                         Rolls his eyes, takes a breath.
                         Scrambles into the gap.  The other
                         five right behind.

                                     IN THE GAP
                         BULLETS EVERYWHERE.

               Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce
               down.  EXPLODE below.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller
               sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.

               A perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING
               TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER

               SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He
               swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward
               Miller.

               A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant
               from death.

               SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE

               Under the overhang to safety.

               MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL
               IS BLOWN OFF.

               UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'll be Goddamned!  I'm not dead!

               Sarge hollers back to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO
                         THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!

                                     MILLER
                         I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.

               Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.
               HIT more Germans.

               SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop
               near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw
               long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.

               THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.

               Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.

                                     MILLER
                         Crosses the gap.  His men follow.

                                     AT THE CREST
                         The Americans swarm over the top.
                         FIRING.

               TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.

               Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans
               are CUT DOWN.

               MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man
               who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel
               charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade, your turn.

               Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.

               Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to
               the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.
               Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED
               EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.

                                     MILLER AND SARGE
                         Survey the field.

                                     SARGE
                         What the hell were you doing?  Drawing
                         fire!

                                     MILLER
                         Worked, didn't it?

                                     SARGE
                         You tryin' to get yourself killed?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need to, the Krauts go that
                         covered.

               Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff
               at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering
               the rocks and the beach below.  He's clearly affected.

               Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves
               on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German
               bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE
               surround him.  DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of
               CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.  A huge government building stands
               in the heart of Washington, D.C.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:
                         WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C.

               JUNE 8, 1944

               INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Very busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,
               quickly and efficiently.  No small talk.

                                     A CLERK
                         Older than the others, sad-eyed,
                         adds a sheet of paper to a large
                         pile in his out-box.

                                     CLOSE SHOT
                         An outgoing telegram.  It reads:
                         "We regret to inform you...killed in
                         action...heroic service..."  This is
                         the paperwork of death.

                                     THE CLERK
                         Pulls out a file.  Reads.  Finds
                         something troubling.  Quickly shuffles
                         through some other papers.  Finds
                         what he's looking for.  Rises from
                         his desk and hurries out of the
                         office.

               INT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Seen through the glass wall.  The clerk speaks to a YOUNG
               LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.
               He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the
               office with the clerk on his heels.

               INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Again, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks
               to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly
               bothered by what he's being told.  The Captain takes the
               papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.

               INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               A busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The
               walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex
               deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of
               ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly
               hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff
               officer, walks in.

               Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know
               about.

               One-armed colonel Yes?

               Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha
               Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother
               was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this
               morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams
               this afternoon.

               The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear
               and freeze.

               One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.

               Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The
               youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First
               Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front.

               One-armed colonel Is he alive?

               Young captain We don't know.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.

               One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his
               heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go.

               EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY

               A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising
               behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.

               EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY

               A whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as
               far as the eye can see.

                                     IN THE YARD
                         A tire swing.  A bushel basket nailed
                         to the barn over a dirt basketball
                         court.

                                     A PORCH SWING
                         Sits empty.  Moves slightly.

               ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR

               Four American flag decals.  Each one, a man in service.

                                     MARGARET RYAN
                         Steps out.  Around sixty.  Her face
                         shows the lines of a life of hard
                         work and mother hood.  A good woman.

               She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the
               fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind
               the black car.

               She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her
               house.  She starts to grow uneasy.

               As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She
               reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.

               The car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out,
               one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come.

               INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY

               Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.
               GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to
               his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.  Half-
               a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and
               the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the
               file.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                              (softly)
                         Goddamn it.

               One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company
               in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan
               brothers died on the Juneau.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Any contact with the fourth brother,
                         James?

               One-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles
               inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines.

               General Marshall hardens.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Well, if he's alive, we're going to
                         send someone to get him the hell out
                         of there.  That's just what the
                         General's staff wanted to hear.

               EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY

               NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE.
               Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force
               of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the
               craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in
               the distance.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:
                         Normandy 1300 hours June 9

                                     MILLER
                         Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through
                         the fire and dives into a sludge-
                         filled crater.  He surfaces, sees
                         Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a
                         horrific smell.  Their conversation
                         is repeatedly broken by FIRING And
                         DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we
                         swimming in?

                                     REIBEN
                         Shit, sir.

                                     SARGE
                         Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're
                         in a cranberry bog.

                                     REIBEN
                         Out of the frying pan, into the
                         fucking latrine.

                                     MILLER
                         Look at the bright side, the Krauts
                         sure as hell don't want to advance
                         and hold this cesspool.

               Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.

                                     MILLER
                         Get Fire Control, we need some
                         artillery...

               Radioman Trying, sir.

               MORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben's worried.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, what if they send some other
                         company into Caen ahead of us while
                         we're pinned down here?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, we're the only Rangers
                         this side of the continent, we've
                         got to be first into Caen.

                                     SARGE
                         Who cares?

                                     REIBEN
                         I care.  Don't you know what Caen's
                         famous for, Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         Frogs?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie.

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah?  So?

               THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant.  Miller, Sarge
               and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German
               positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck
               down again.

                                     REIBEN
                         So, you ever heard of employee
                         discounts?  My uncle sells shoes,
                         gets twenty-five percent off
                         everything in the line, got a closet
                         filled with the best looking shoes
                         you ever seen.

               MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.

                                     REIBEN
                         Just picture some French number been
                         spending all day, every day, making
                         cream-colored, shear-body negligees
                         with gentle-lift silk cups and
                         gathered empire waists, what the
                         hell you think she wears at night?

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, how the hell do you know so
                         much about lingerie?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's
                         got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in
                         it, from the time I could crawl, we
                         carry Caen lingerie, it's the best
                         there is, it's all I been thinking
                         about since the invasion.

               Another pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS
               HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         There's a war on, good chance they're
                         not still making lingerie in Caen.

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Captain, they'll always make
                         lingerie, it's one of the three basic
                         needs of man -- food, shelter, silk
                         teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

                                     REIBEN
                         Happy to, sir.

               Radioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at
               H.Q., right away.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe the war's over.

               A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops
               falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben
               looks dubiously at Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I don't think so, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                              (to Radioman)
                         Stay at it until you get fire control.
                              (to Sarge)
                         Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles
               out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.

               EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY

               Chaos.  Under fire.  INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN
               SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Runs over the broken ground and makes
                         it to the sandbagged H.Q.  He stumbles
                         down the make-shift stairs.

               INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY

               Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which
               continue through the scene.  Miller salutes a Major.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.

               Major Go on in.

               Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a
               dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.
               Very busy.  A field map dominates the center of the small
               space.

               The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him
               respectfully.  He's clearly someone special.

               COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.
               He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of
               the storm.  He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...I understand your problem, but if
                         we don't get those tanks off-loaded
                         by 0600, we're going to have an entire
                         division up at Caen with its ass
                         hanging out of its pants...

               A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of
               paper.

               Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list.

                                     MILLER
                         My what?

               Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in-
               action.

               Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.

                                     MILLER
                         Find a chaplain.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...alright, let me know when.

               Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Have the Second and Third Regiments
                         hold at St. Michel until we get those
                         tanks.  Aide Yes, sir.

               Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Report.

                                     MILLER
                         Sector four is secured, we put out
                         the last three German one-fifty-fives,
                         found them about two miles in from
                         Ponte du Hoc.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Resistance?

                                     MILLER
                         A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery,
                         we took twenty-three prisoners, turned
                         them over to intelligence.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Casualties?

                                     MILLER
                         Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

               An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.

                                     MILLER
                         They didn't want to give up those
                         one-fifty-fives, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         It was a hard assignment, that's why
                         you got it.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Where are your men now?

                                     MILLER
                         Pinned down, a mile east of here,
                         waiting for some help from the navy
                         guns.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         I'm sending Simpson to take over for
                         you, the division is going to Caen,
                         you're not coming with us, I have
                         something else for you.

                                     MILLER
                         Sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         There's a Private James Ryan who
                         parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
                         First near Ramelle.  I want you to
                         take a squad up there.  If he's alive,
                         bring him back to the beach for
                         debarkation.  Take whoever you need,
                         you've got your pick of the company.

                                     MILLER
                         A private, sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         He's the last of four brothers, the
                         other three were killed in action.
                         This is straight from the Chief of
                         Staff.

                                     MILLER
                         But, sir...I...I...

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Spit it out, Captain.

               MILLER HESITATES, THEN:

                                     MILLER
                         Respectfully, sir, sending men all
                         the way up to Ramelle to save one
                         private doesn't make a fucking,
                         goddamned bit of sense.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

               The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel
               Anderson glares at Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         You think just because you hold the
                         Congressional Medal of Honor, you
                         can say any damn thing you please to
                         your superior officers?

               Miller considers the question, then smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir, more or less.

               Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head
               off, then he smiles, too.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Alright, I'll give you that.
                         Continue.

                                     MILLER
                         The numbers don't make sense, sir.
                         His brothers are dead, that's too
                         bad, but they're out of the equation.
                         Sending men up there is bleeding
                         heart crapola from three thousand
                         miles away.  One private is simply
                         not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson
                         This one is.  He's worth a lot more
                         than that.  Which is why I'm sending
                         you, you're the best field officer
                         there is.

               Miller Shrugs.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?
                         Fine officer, regular church goer,
                         writes poetry, he might like a mission
                         like this.
                              (beat)
                         And he's taller than me.

               Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's
               time to get back to business.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         That's enough, Captain, you have
                         your orders.  Major Thomas will fill
                         you in.

               Miller knows when to back off.  He salutes.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Good luck, John.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank you, sir.

               Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.
               Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices
               the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they
               go back to work.

               EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY

               A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the
               deck of the enormous ship.

               EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY

               HUGE EXPLOSIONS.  The big naval shells SLAM into the German
               position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field.

                                     IN THE CRATERS
                         Miller's Ranger company ducks and
                         covers.  The BARRAGE SUBSIDES.  The
                         Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging
                         from crater to crater, advancing
                         against the remaining Germans who
                         return SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs and dives into a crater
                         with Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge,
                         we're heading out.

                                     SARGE
                         Caen?

                                     MILLER
                         I wish.  You and I are taking a squad
                         up to Ramelle on a public relations
                         mission.

                                     SARGE
                         You?  Leading a squad?

                                     MILLER
                         Some private up there lost three
                         brothers, got a ticket home.

                                     SARGE
                         What about the company?

                                     MILLER
                         Simpson.

                                     SARGE
                         Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking
                         pogo stick!

                                     MILLER
                         I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with
                         his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.

                                     SARGE
                         Beasley's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade.  Translators?

                                     SARGE
                         Fresh out.

                                     MILLER
                         What about Talbot?

                                     SARGE
                         Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn,
                         I'll go see if I can find another
                         one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and
                         Wade, meet me at transport.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the
               crater and crouch-run in opposite directions.

               EXT. TRANSPORT H.Q. - NINETEENTH INFANTRY - DAY

               Just in from the beaches.  DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS.
               Nothing close.  Dust.  Confusion.  Vehicles of every sort
               moving out.  Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks.  In the middle
               of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make-
               shift desk made out of crate.  He yells at a PRIVATE.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS OUT
                         OF THERE!

               Private They're blocked in!

                                     SERGEANT
                         THEN UNBLOCK 'EM!

               SARGE< REIBEN, JACKSON AND WADE

               Wait nearby.  Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering.
               The others are relaxed.

                                     MILLER
                         Strides through the chaos, avoiding
                         the passing vehicles.  He sees his
                         men and walks toward them.  Reiben
                         hurries up to Miller, pleading.

                                     REIBEN
                         Please, sir, you can't take me to
                         Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir,
                         please, I told you, they make Caen
                         lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's
                         the best there is, it's...oh, please,
                         sir...

                                     MILLER
                         Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're
                         the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (desperate)
                         No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or
                         what about Faulkner?  Or that little
                         guy with the glasses?

                                     MILLER
                         Trust me, you're the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (whimpering)
                         But, sir...

               Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides
               off toward the Supply Sergeant's table.  Sarge falls in next
               to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         You get a translator, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I've got a line on one.

                                     TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE
                         Chaos.  Vehicles THUNDERING by.  The
                         Supply Sergeant juggles runners and
                         paperwork.  Miller steps up to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, I need a truck.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how
                         'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top,
                         red with black interior.

                                     MILLER
                         White-walls?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         No white-walls, sir, there's a war
                         on.
                              (to the Private)
                         NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER
                         THERE!
                              (to Miller)
                         I can't help you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         A half-track, anything.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir.  Division is using
                         everything on wheels to get up to
                         Caen.
                              (notices Miller's
                              shoulder patch)
                         How come you guys aren't going?

               Miller ignores the question.  He spies a jeep.

                                     MILLER
                         How about that jeep?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog
                         told me if anyone breathes on it,
                         I'll get busted and if anyone so
                         much as touches it with their little
                         finger, I'll get court marshaled.
                         If you were to take it, they'd shoot
                         me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk
                         all the way up to Ramelle?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         What's at Ramelle beside a lot of
                         Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going
                         home, if he's alive.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Senator's son?

                                     MILLER
                         No, three brothers of his were killed
                         in action.  Command wants him out of
                         there.

               The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Damn...I got a couple brothers...

               Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly.  The Supply
               Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY

               Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep.
               Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam
               of men and vehicles.  Miller rides shotgun.  Reiben, Jackson
               and Wade are crammed in the back.

               The SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go.  Behind him, GENERAL
               GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his
               huge staff.  He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.

                                     GENERAL GAVIN
                         SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY
                         GODDAMNED JEEP!?

               The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns
               to take his lumps.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American
               staging area.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to make one stop.

               Miller points the way for Sarge.

               EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly
               white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles
               and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.
               SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out.

                                     MILLER
                         Wait here.

               He strides into the tent.

               INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious
               nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and
               gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,
               detailed work.

               One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
               patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
               glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
               EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
               Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

               Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

               Upham Sir, I'm Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         I understand you speak French and
                         German.

               Upham Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have an accent?

               Upham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a
               touch of the Bavarian.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, you've been re-assigned to me,
                         we're going to Ramelle.

               Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.

               Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.

                                     MILLER
                         That's my understanding.

               Upham Lots of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have a problem with that,
                         Corporal?

               Upham Sir, I've never been in combat.  I make maps.  I
               translate.

                                     MILLER
                         I need a translator, all mine have
                         been killed.

               Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll come back to you.  Get your
                         gear.

               Upham hesitates.

               Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?

               Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

               Upham I'm writing a book and I...

               Miller's expression gives him his answer.

               Upham Uh, how about a pencil?

                                     MILLER
                         A small one.

               Miller shoos him off.

                                     MILLER
                         Go, go...

               Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the
               others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA
               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
               in military history.

               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered
               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles
               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-
               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships
               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of
               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some
               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny
               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day
               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are
               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
               equipment, bodies.

               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine
               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly
               take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in
               the back of the jeep.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, can I ask you a question?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         Where are you planning on putting
                         Private Ryan, sir?

               Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         It's just that it's kind of crowded
                         back here, I was wondering if you're
                         expecting to have more room on the
                         way back?

               Miller points out a turn to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Left.

               Sarge makes the turn.  Miller folds up the map and pockets
               it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now we've got a straight shot, due
                         north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,
                         two villages between here and there,
                         St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take
                         the jeep as far as we can, then go
                         on on foot.

                                     SARGE
                         We in radio contact with anybody up
                         there?

                                     MILLER
                         Somebody put the wrong crystals in
                         every one of the Hundred-and-First's
                         radios the night before the drop,
                         not one of them works.  We're going
                         in blind.

                                     REIBEN
                         I usually like surprises.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we likely to run into?

                                     MILLER
                         A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut
                         divisions, no fronts, no lines, the
                         drops were completely fouled up,
                         we've got little pockets of
                         paratroopers all over the place,
                         trying to hang on.  Command says we
                         hold St. Mere, but north of that,
                         it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's
                         where he's supposed to be, he's more
                         than likely dead.

                                     SARGE
                         Hell of a mission.

                                     MILLER
                         Yep, hell of a mission.

               IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP

               Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring
               at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful
               smile.

               Upham Hi.  So, uh, you're all Rangers?

               Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an
               insect.

               Upham I'm Upham.

               (pointing at his corporal's stripes)

               Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.
               Their jaws drop.

                                     REIBEN
                              (to Wade)
                         You want to shoot him, or should I?

               Wade It's not my turn.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,
                         Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

               Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.

               Upham Miller?

                                     MILLER
                         I don't want anybody to shoot him,
                         that's an order.  He speaks French
                         and his German has a touch of the
                         Bavarian.

               Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?

               Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         ...who won the Congressional Medal
                         of Hon...?

               Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances
               of Miller's men.  Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-
               faced.

               No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as
               if it had never happened.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony
                         of this mission is fucking killing
                         me.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, how so?

                                     REIBEN
                         I should be on my way to Caen, sir.
                         It's like Beethoven, the guy's one
                         of the greatest composers ever lived
                         and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean,
                         who'd he piss off?  And here I am,
                         the Beethoven of ladies foundation
                         garments, one step away from Caen,
                         the center of the known lingerie
                         universe and instead, I'm going to
                         Ramelle to save some fucking private
                         who's probably already dead.

                                     MILLER
                         There's to be a bright side, look
                         for it.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous
                         for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company
                         is going to Caen and we're going to
                         the goddamned cheese capital of
                         France.  There is no bright side.

                                     MILLER
                         There's always a bright side.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm listening, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Well, I, for one, like cheese.

               Wade pipes up cheerfully.

               Wade Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's
               something up there for me to blow up.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, you're a happy idiot.

               THEY ROUND A TURN

               SKID TO A STOP AT A:

               BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES

               A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him.

                                     MILLER
                         How's the road up to St. Mere?

               Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding
               somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.

                                     MILLER
                         Anybody getting through?

               Lieutenant The lucky ones.

               Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying
               gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels
               down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters.
               They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct
               hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.

               AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS

               On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of
               a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham
               grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's
               reaction.

                                     IN THE BACK
                         The men bounce up and down like
                         stuffed animals, doing their best to
                         not be thrown out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, this is better than Coney
                         Island!

                                     A HUGE BUMP
                         Bounces Reiben up and slams his back
                         down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN
                         PAIN.

                                     MILLER
                         Just trying to make room for Ryan.

               Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his
               shovel from under his bruised ass.

               THEY ROUND A BEND

               See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning,
               obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN

               Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER

                                     MILLER
                              (sweetly)
                         Sarge?

               SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on.

                                     ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES
                         Thirty yards ahead of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Directs Sarge off the road.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got the road zeroed.

                                     SARGE
                         Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep
                         off the road.

                                     THE JEEP BOUNCES
                         Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing
                         everyone out.  Somehow they hang on.
                         The jeep tears along the rutted field.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Just behind them.

                                     SARGE DRIVES MADLY
                         Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid
                         the biggest ruts and bumps.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Close on their side.  Showers them
                         with debris.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus Christ!

               MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN

               Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got a hell of a spotter
                         somewhere.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Even closer.  The jeep's PEPPERED
                         WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH
                         the smoke.

                                     MILLER
                         S-curves, Sarge.

                                     SARGE
                         Turns shallow curves without slowing
                         down.

               SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER

               Tries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned
               earth.  STOPS SHORT.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON

               THROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt.

                                     SARGE AND MILLER
                         Hang on.  Stay in the jeep but are
                         battered.  All stunned.  MILLER Is
                         first to regain his bearings.  Jumps
                         up.  Checks out the jeep.  Undamaged.
                         Deep in the soft dirt.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge!  Reverse!

               Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.
               The wheels spin.  Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.
               Yells to the others.

                                     MILLER
                         COME ON!  YOU WANNA WALK?

                                     STILL DAZED
                         Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw
                         their heads back on.  Shoulder into
                         the jeep.  Push for all they're worth.
                         The WHEELS STILL SPIN.

               ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT

                                     MILLER IGNORES IT
                         He's the only one who does.

                                     SARGE
                         Captain, they got us zeroed.

               Upham is very nervous.

                                     UPHAM
                         That's bracketing, right?

               They all ignore him.

                                     UPHAM
                         I know about bracketing.  I read
                         about it.  The next one is going to
                         land right on us.

                                     MILLER
                         FORWARD!  FORWARD!
                              (beat)
                         NOW REVERSE!

               Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE.  Rocks it.  SLAMS IT BACK
               INTO FORWARD.  Makes progress.

               ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP.  WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     MILLER
                         PUSH!

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     THE TIRES SCREAM
                         A bit more progress.  It's almost
                         out.

               THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS

               Knowing the shell is coming any second.  Upham is beside
               himself.

                                     SARGE
                              (sweetly)
                         Oh, Captain...

                                     ONE MORE PUSH
                         The jeep rocks back in, deeper.

                                     MILLER
                         SHIT!

               THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE MEN
                         Instantly take off.  Away from the
                         jeep.  As fast as they can.

               THE SHELL SCREAMS IN

               The men hit the dirt.

                                     DIRECT HIT
                         OBLITERATING THE JEEP

                                     THE MEN
                         Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.
                         STUNNED by the concussion.  SHOWERED
                         with dirt, rock and debris.

                                     MILLER
                         Is first up.  Sarge and the men
                         struggle to their feet.  Hear MORE
                         INCOMING.  Miller grabs Upham by the
                         collar and pulls him up.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE COME THE MORTARS!

               THEY ALL TAKE OFF

               Running as fast as they can.

               THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN

               The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between.  But
               there must be a dozen mortars firing.  The shells are almost
               constant.

                                     THE FIELD
                         The six Americans run madly, in zig-
                         zag patterns through the gauntlet of
                         MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  BOOM

                                     RUNNING, STUMBLING
                         BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

               UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND

               Miller yanks him up.  Half-drags him to the edge of the field.

               THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES

               Keep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards
               in.

                                     THE EXPLOSIONS STOP
                         THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling
                         to catch their breath. Check their
                         body parts.  Everything's there.
                         They have their weapons, most of
                         their gear.

               Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is
               nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         General Gavin is going to be very
                         irritated at you, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands on the edge of the woods,
                         almost in a trance.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

                                     SARGE
                         Sssssh!

               Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from
               position to position.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, maps.

               Sarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent,
               frozen in place.

                                     MILLER
                         Two eighty-eights, just under two-
                         and-a-half miles, that way, vector
                         from the jeep, through those two
                         trees at the base of the hill.  The
                         mortars came from behind that rise,
                         there, four of them.

               Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out
               of it.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade, the radio.

               Wade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed.

                                     UPHAM
                         You can tell all that, just by the
                         sound, sire?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not all.  There were nine
                         gunners on the eighty-eights, one
                         had a broken heel on his boot, two
                         had bratwurst for supper last night,
                         one of them is named Fritz, the other,
                         Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard
                         to tell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Corporal, you have just seen one of
                         Captain Miller's many God-given
                         talents.  If, by some miracle, you
                         survive, you will witness many more
                         of them.

               Sarge finished vectoring.

                                     SARGE
                         Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care
                         of those eighty-eights?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not what we're here for.

                                     WADE
                              (re. radio)
                         I've got command, Captain.

               Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                              (into radio)
                         This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,
                         sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-
                         three by baker-three.  Two eighty-
                         eights.  Tell our boys to come in
                         low from the east in case the Krauts
                         have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over.

               A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade
               packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir,
               wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.

                                     SARGE
                         He's right, Captain, it might be
                         kind of dangerous for those flyboys.

                                     MILLER
                         Tell that to Private James Ryan.
                         We've got our orders.  Let's go.

               Miller heads off without pausing or looking back.  The rest
               of the men don't like it, but they follow.  Upham trails,
               amazed at Miller.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               Miller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in
               alongside Reiben.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     REIBEN
                         Get lost.

               Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     JACKSON
                         You writin' a book or somethin'?

                                     UPHAM
                         As a matter of fact, I am.

                                     JACKSON
                         Figured.

               Wade overhears and smiles at Upham.

                                     WADE
                         I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E,
                         I'm small but wiry, with piercing,
                         steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn
                         but handsome face, I'm from Colorado,
                         my father's a mining engineer, don't
                         you take notes?

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         Demolition, right?

                                     WADE
                         Since I was nine years old.  They
                         got a lot of explosives around mines.
                         Me and my little brother could get
                         into any warehouse you ever saw.
                         Damn, we had fun!

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork,
                         Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher.
                         Him and his two brothers got a
                         ministry, The Blessed Church of the
                         Wandering Gospel.

                                     UPHAM
                         In West Fork?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the back of a nineteen and thirty-
                         one stretch Hudson with a big ole'
                         trailer.

                                     UPHAM
                         No kidding.

                                     JACKSON
                         I don't make jokes about things of,
                         or related to, the preaching of the
                         Holy Gospel, including the ministerial
                         calling of my family.

                                     UPHAM
                         So they travel around from place to
                         place and preach?

                                     JACKSON
                         We got us a tent, forty-two feet
                         across, eighteen feet at center,
                         hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs.
                         Circuit's eleven towns, covers all
                         'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller
                         County.  I expect that upon completion
                         of my military service I will be
                         joinin' said ministry.

                                     UPHAM
                         What about the Captain?  Where's he
                         from?

               They all shake their heads.  Miller's out of earshot.

                                     JACKSON
                         You figure that out, you got yourself
                         one nice prize.

                                     SARGE
                         Over three hundred bucks, last I
                         heard.  Wade Company's got a pool,
                         five bucks gets you in, whoever
                         guesses where the Captain's from and
                         what he did as a civilian gets it
                         all.

                                     JACKSON
                         The whole kit and caboodle.

                                     UPHAM
                         But everybody's heard of him, he won
                         the Congressional Medal of Honor, he
                         saved a dozen men.

                                     REIBEN
                         We know.

                                     UPHAM
                         Somebody must know where he's from,
                         what he did for a living.

                                     SARGE
                         Somebody probably does.

                                     UPHAM
                         Why don't you just ask him?

                                     JACKSON
                         The Captain prefers not to discuss
                         certain aspects of his life, in
                         particular, everything up to and
                         including his enlistment in the United
                         States Army.

                                     SARGE
                         I've been with him since Anzio.  I'm
                         closer to him that I am to my own
                         brother but I don't even know what
                         state he's from.  Somewhere in the
                         Northeast as near as I can figure.
                         I don't even have a clue what he did
                         for a living as civilian.

               Reiben shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         No one's gonna win the money for the
                         simple reason that the Captain never
                         was a civilian.  They assembled him
                         at O.C.S. out of spare body parts
                         from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a
                         fact.

                                     JACKSON
                              (defensively)
                         You got somethin' against the Cap'n?

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, no.  I think he's the best
                         officer in the whole goddamned army,
                         bar none.

               They all nod in assent, no argument there.

                                     JACKSON
                         You got that right.

               Miller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation.  Upham
               watches Miller, with even more curiosity.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a
               country cow path.  They're staying close to the cover of the
               brush.  Miller walks tall now.

                                     JACKSON
                         Captain, my feet are most
                         uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we
                         was gonna have to walk all the way
                         to Ramelle, I never would 'a
                         volunteered for this here mission.

                                     MILLER
                         You didn't volunteer, Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                         I most likely would have, sir, had I
                         been given the opportunity.

                                     REIBEN
                         If we find Ryan and he's still alive,
                         that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry
                         this goddamned B.A.R. back to the
                         beach for me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Army life is too dang easy, my feet
                         have gone soft.  Back home, we go
                         out squirrel huntin', I walk forever
                         and a day and then some, don't even
                         raise a blister.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what a B.A.R. weighs?
                         Nineteen and a half pounds, not
                         counting ammo.
                              (re. ammo bandoleers)
                         And you think these things are
                         comfortable?  They may look good but
                         they weigh twelve pounds each, that's
                         thirty-six pounds, right there.

                                     WADE
                         So what?  I've got three satchel
                         charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen-
                         and-a-half pineapples, and all my
                         regular gear.  You don't hear me
                         complaining.

                                     REIBEN
                         That's because, as I have pointed
                         out on numerous occasions, you are a
                         happy idiot.

                                     WADE
                         No, I just happen to take the
                         Captain's advice and look at the
                         bright side of things.

                                     UPHAM
                         How do you do it?

                                     WADE
                         It's easy, it runs in my family,
                         take my grandfather, for example...

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to
                         that grandfather thing again.

                                     WADE
                         As I was saying, before I was so
                         rudely interrupted, my grandfather
                         got old, as grandfathers tend to do.
                         He needed someone to take care of
                         him.  We move around all the time,
                         going from one mine to another, so
                         we had to put him in a home.  Nice
                         enough place but kind of depressing.
                         But not for Granddad.  He just
                         convinced himself he was on a cruise
                         ship, going to Tahiti, he had his
                         own cabin, first class, with room
                         service.  It just so happened that
                         the weather was always lousy, so he
                         never bothered to go up on deck.
                         Happiest guy you ever saw until the
                         day he died.

                                     UPHAM
                         You think he really believed it?

                         Who knows?  It worked.

                         Fine, you convince yourself you got
                         a pack full of feathers and goddamned
                         Private James Ryan can carry my
                         fucking gear.

                         Reiben, you can be very unpleasant
                         to be around sometimes.

                         You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I

                         Look at Upham, you don't hear him
                         complaining.

               Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a
               shot.

                                     UPHAM
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I was
                         just thinking...

               The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         That I'm so fucking tired of this
                         goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand
                         dollars to see that bastard Ryan
                         crawl on his belly over an acre of
                         broken glass to hear my great-aunt
                         Martha fart through a field-phone.

               The men are stunned.

                                     REIBEN
                         Jesus Christ, he's a natural!

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, are you sure you've never
                         been in combat?

               Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain
               I'd remember.

               Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.

                                     MILLER
                         He's good.

               They walk on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable.

               Miller smiles, situation normal.

               EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active
               battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR
               EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers
               crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.

               Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a
               couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across
               and disappear into the remains of a building.

               Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a
               corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread
               out down the block behind him.

               Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental
               picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of
               an alley across the street and down the block.  They are
               CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.

               As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET
               SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.

               Miller motions Jackson across first.

                                     MILLER
                         Stay low.

               Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,
               kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and
               makes it to the cover of the far side.

                                     JACKSON
                         Dang!  That was close!

               Miller nods to Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Your turn.

               Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him
               very gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Zig-zag, change your pace a couple
                         times, you'll be alright.

               Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, I'm going to draw fire for
                         you.
                              (sternly)
                         But if I do, you goddamned well better
                         go.

               Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.

               CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks to Upham

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

               Upham nods, still terrified.

               MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN

               Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.

                                     MILLER
                         Go.

               Upham runs.

               A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.

               He doesn't budge.

               UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.

               REIBEN watches Upham run.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, that guy can move.

               A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to
               the far side.

               MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't
               even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.
               He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.

                                     SARGE
                              (under his breath so
                              only Miller can hear)
                         Damn fool.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, he's fast!

                                     MILLER
                              (glances at Sarge,
                              speaks to Reiben)
                         Glad of it.

                                     UPHAM
                         On the other side of the street,
                         crouches in a doorway with Jackson.
                         Upham is a bit in shock, less from
                         the nearness of the bullets than
                         from what Miller just did for him.

                                     MILLER
                         DASHES across the street.

               GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches
               behind him.

               HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Bring 'em over.

               UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

               Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         One at a time.

                                     MILLER
                         Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-
                         runs down the block.  He passes a:

                                     BOMBED OUT BUILDING
                         Out of the line of fire.  A dozen
                         dead American soldiers lined up on
                         the ground.  The battered, bloody
                         bodies, only partially covered by
                         ponchos.

               Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.
               Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees the dead and wounded, shows no
                         reaction.  Runs to:

                                     AN ALLEY
                         Captain Hamill and his men are bunched
                         there, out of the line of fire.
                         He's sending off a squad to continue
                         their door-to-door.

               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the
               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.

               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two
               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak
               familiarly.

               Captain hamill How was the road in?

                                     MILLER
                         We had a jeep until a few hours ago,
                         a nice one, it had a cute little
                         flag with a couple of stars on it.

               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.

               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.

                                     MILLER
                         We called in a strike on the eighty-
                         eights that took it out, but it's
                         the Kraut spotter that counts,
                         wherever the hell that bastard is.

               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.

               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying
               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying
               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant
               steeple.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson.

               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson
               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and
               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to
               his back.

               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and
               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
               unusual, long-barrel, rifle.

               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,
               along with Upham, watch curiously.

               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,
               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he
               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He
               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham
               is fascinated.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is that?

               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized
               shell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel
                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,
                         elevated three-glass scope and a
                         single-throw hammer.

                                     UPHAM
                         The Army gave you that?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep.

                                     UPHAM
                         You must be a hell a shot.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not where I come from.

               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.

               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the
               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight
               and waits, absolutely motionless.

                                     UPHAM
                         That must be four thousand yards.

                                     JACKSON
                              (without taking his
                              eye from the scope)
                         Forty-two-hundred, I figure.

                                     UPHAM
                         You take account of the wind?

               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
               back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,
               some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between
               Upham and Jackson.

                                     REIBEN
                              (put-on Southern accent)
                         Dang right, he take 'count of the
                         wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a
                         Kentucky windage?

               Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the
               trigger.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, how many time I got to tell
                         you, I'm from Tennessee.

                                     REIBEN
                         They got squirrels there, too, right?

               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart
               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them
               the St. Mere road is open.

               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to
               Miller.

               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?

                                     MILLER
                         Very far, they're not coming this
                         way, they're going to take Caen first.

               Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a
               lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it
               gets better.  How many men did you bring?

                                     MILLER
                         Five, but we not staying, we're on
                         our way to Ramelle.

               Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private
               Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, you know about that?

               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in
               with the early wounded or dead.

               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED
               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.

               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted
               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two
               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,
               they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.

                                     MILLER
                         Wonderful.

               Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the
               hell out of there before those Krauts show up.

                                     MILLER
                         How do we get out of here?

               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in
               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If
               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,
               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
               tomorrow night.

               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his
               head.

               Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?

               Miller shrugs.

               Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but
               I understand what you're doing?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?

               Captain hamill Good luck.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks.

               Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.

               Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful
               sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's find someplace to hole up.

               Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head
               of the alley, Miller passes Upham.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I'm sorry about what happened,
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         It was nothing.

                                     UPHAM
                         But you could have gotten killed and
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         Like I said, it was nothing.
                              (to the men)
                         Don't bunch up.

               He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham
               watches him go.

                                     UPHAM
                         Did you see what he did, back there?
                         He stepped right into the open, so I
                         could get across.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shit, that was no big deal.

                                     WADE
                         They can't kill him.

                                     SARGE
                         Like hell they can't.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade's right, it's some kind of
                         scientific, magnetic thing, I can't
                         explain it, but I've seen it.

                                     WADE
                         We all have, he's got nine lives, or
                         he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

               The men are equal parts joking and admiring.  Sarge is
               neither.

                                     SARGE
                         No one's bulletproof.  No one.
                              (beat)
                         C'mon, stay low.

               Sarge takes off after Miller.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

               Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins
               of a medieval church.  Miller, settled into a comfortable
               spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed.
               Reiben paces.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, could you please explain
                         the math of this mission to me?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, what do you want to know?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms,
                         since when does six equal one?  What's
                         the sense in risking six guys to
                         save one?

                                     MILLER
                         Ours is not to reason why.

                                     REIBEN
                         Huh?

                                     MILLER
                         Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick
                         up this kid, high-tail it back to
                         division, everything'll work out
                         fine.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'd much rather die in Caen than
                         Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, there's a fairly good chance
                         you're not going to die at all.

                                     REIBEN
                         Easy for you to say, sir.
                              (beat)
                         Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring
                         his fucking neck.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor
                         bastard's mother.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you
                         got a mother?

                                     JACKSON
                         Last I knew.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of
                         us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain
                         has a mother.

               Miller smiles.  Reiben eyes him and reconsiders.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, maybe not the Captain, but the
                         rest of us have mothers.

                                     MILLER
                         You have orders, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

                                     MILLER
                         I'd love to hear it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is
                         a serious misallocation of valuable
                         military resources.  Miller Go on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Well, sir, by my way a thinkin' I am
                         a finely made instrument of warfare.
                         What I mean by that is, if you was
                         to put me with this here sniper rifle
                         anywhere up to and includin' one
                         mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear
                         line of sight, war's over.

               Miller nods.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I want you to listen closely
                         to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe.
                         Jackson, continue.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that
                         the entire resources of the United
                         States Army oughta be dedicated to
                         one thing and one thing only, and
                         that is to put me and this here weapon
                         on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle
                         of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one
                         to question decisions made up on
                         high, sir, but it seems to me that
                         saving one private, no matter how
                         grievous the losses of his family,
                         is a waste of my God-given talent.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade?

                                     WADE
                         Hell, I don't mind this mission,
                         sir, as long as there's something up
                         at Ramelle for...

                                     REIBEN
                              (finishing Wade's
                              sentence)
                         ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah,
                         we heard that.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?

                                     UPHAM
                         Pass.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         I'm just here to keep a bunch of
                         numb-nuts, including one certain,
                         frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate,
                         from getting themselves killed.

               Reiben eyes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         And what about you, Captain?

               Miller looks at Reiben, shocked.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, what's the matter with you?
                         I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain.
                         There's a chain of command.  Griping
                         goes one way, up, only up, never
                         down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to
                         my superior officers.  Up, get it?
                         I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe
                         in front of you.  How long you been
                         in the army?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.
                              (beat)
                         But if you weren't a captain, or if
                         I were a major, what would you say?

               Miller considers his response.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case, I would say this is an
                         excellent mission, with an extremely
                         valuable objective, worthy of my
                         best efforts.

               Reiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no
               obvious sarcasm.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         In addition, as I pointed out earlier,
                         I have a fondness for cheese and I
                         hope to have the opportunity to sample
                         some of the Ramelle products, when
                         we arrive there, to see if they live
                         up to their excellent reputation.
                         Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
                         for the mother of Private James Ryan
                         and I'm more than willing to lay
                         down my life, and the lives of my
                         men, especially you, Reiben, to help
                         relieve her suffering.  The men
                         thoroughly enjoy the performance.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, if you were not a captain, I
                         would compliment you, now, for being
                         an excellent liar.

                                     MILLER
                         But I am a captain.  If I were not a
                         captain, I would thank you for the
                         compliment and tell you that the
                         ability to lie comes from being a
                         top-notch poker player, which I am,
                         having learned at the side of my
                         mother who is, by popular acclaim,
                         the best poker player in...

               The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're
               about to find out Miller's home town.  Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         ...my home town, which shall remain
                         un-named.

               The men ease back, disappointed.

                                     MILLER
                         Any further thoughts on the subject?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like
                         to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,
                         fuck the cheese capital of France
                         and while we're at it, fuck Private
                         James Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll make a note of your suggestions
                         but I'll leave that last one to you,
                         especially if he's already dead.

               The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets
               serious.

                                     MILLER
                         We move out in two hours, try and
                         get some sleep.

               The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all
               settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to
               follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange
               men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow
               suit.

               Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his
               flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,
               he studies his maps while his men rest.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER)

               Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson,
               Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his
               flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,
               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in
               Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.

                                     SARGE
                         You ever going to open those letters?
                         Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe.

                                     SARGE
                         It's not normal, not reading letters
                         from home.

                                     MILLER
                         Since when have things been normal?

                                     SARGE
                         You got me.  Afraid of bad news?

                                     MILLER
                         Nope.

                                     SARGE
                         Good news?

               Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of
               them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at
               the men.

                                     SARGE
                         You think they'll be alright?

                                     MILLER
                         They're fine.  As long as they can
                         gripe, they'll be alright.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about you?

               Miller considers the question, doesn't answer.

                                     MILLER
                         They guys here aren't going to be
                         able to hold out until battalion
                         shows up.

                                     SARGE
                         Nope.

                                     MILLER
                         Command isn't going to let them
                         withdraw and the Germans sure as
                         hell aren't going to let them
                         surrender.

                                     SARGE
                         Three for three.

                                     MILLER
                         If we stayed, we could make a
                         difference.

                                     SARGE
                         You're kidding yourself.

                                     MILLER
                         You never know.

               They sit in silence for a moment.

                                     SARGE
                         I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now you're the one kidding yourself.
                              (beat)
                         Hell of  a mission.

                                     SARGE
                         Yup, hell of a mission.

               Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Rise and shine, boys.  Let's go.

               Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their
               gear.

               EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT

               SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY
               BOOMS.  Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral
               toward the outskirts of town.  They're just a small squad,
               but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are
               very formidable-looking.

               EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

               Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill
               and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:

               A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON

               Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The
               AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the
               countryside like a tidal wave.

               Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.

               IT'S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE.  The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY
               is incredible, strange, other-worldly.

               EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.

               Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.

               MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.

               SARGE notices, says nothing.

               MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes
               go back to the BLAZING SKY.

                                     SARGE
                              (awe-struck)
                         Makes you feel small, doesn't it?

                                     MILLER
                         It doesn't take this.

               Upham's face shows more fear than awe.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wasn't made for this.

                                     MILLER
                              (bitterly)
                         You think the rest of us were?

               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns
               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a
               hold of himself and speaks gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect
                         you, this shit's gonna keep him up
                         all night, anyway.

               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for
               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, this ain't what they pay
                         us for.

               Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points
               the way.

               Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a
               gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until
               you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.

               As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to
               move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private
               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up
               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to
               Reiben.

               Gentle-faced private Here.

               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-
               ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's
               vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.

               Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at
               Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.

               Reiben takes the ammo.

                                     REIBEN
                              (gently)
                         Just what I need.

               Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands
               them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks, but you may need these more
                         than us, or Ryan.

               Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes
               the ammo back.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's move out.

               Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,
               lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill
               and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a
               strange bit of hope.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT

               The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The
               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way
               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside
               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.
               Sarge How long's your hand been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         A couple of weeks.  It started in
                         Portsmouth when they brought us down
                         for loading.

                                     SARGE
                         Is it getting worse?

                                     MILLER
                         No.  It comes and goes.  It stops
                         when I look at it.

                                     SARGE
                         You may have to find yourself a new
                         line of work, this one doesn't seem
                         to agree with you anymore.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll be alright.

               Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk
               on.

               EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)

               Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at
               point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge
               brings up the rear.

               A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate
               only with hand signals.

               JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.

               MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease
               into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY
               MEN appear.

               REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission
               to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them
               go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the
               bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of
               relief and lowers hi B.A.R.

               THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet
               from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed
               with fear.  The others are stone-faced.

               THE GERMANS PASS.

               MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.

               UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh
               of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing
               the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.

               UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly
               exposed.  Shitting bricks.

               Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad
               approaches.

               Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in
               the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-
               kneed, amazed that he's still alive.

               MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the
               rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries
               after Miller, staying close on his heels.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,
               parallel to a cart path.  Wary.

               Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
               other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and
               motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

               Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as
               Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional
               signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts
               away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn
               is visible.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it
                         up.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

               First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by
               the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five.

               Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at
               the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.
               The war is far away.

               Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together
               without speaking for a moment.

                                     MILLER
                         It looks like a Renoir.

                                     UPHAM
                         Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth
                         Symphony, The Normandy?

                                     MILLER
                         I've been humming it.

                                     UPHAM
                         I heard.

                                     MILLER
                         It seemed appropriate.

                                     UPHAM
                         You know classical music?

                                     MILLER
                         Some.

                                     UPHAM
                         Where are you from, Captain?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         What's the pool up to?

               Upham smiles, caught.

                                     UPHAM
                         Over three-hundred.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll tell you what, if I'm still
                         alive when it hits five-hundred,
                         I'll let you know and we'll split
                         the money.

                                     UPHAM
                         If that's the way you feel, why don't
                         we wait until it's up to a thousand.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't expect to live that long.

               Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five hundred, then.

               Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to
               feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself
               back into a commander and barks at Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, private.

               Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure
               him out, then he simply follows him.

               EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN

               The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by
               war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is
               lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,
               hundred of years old.

               Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They
               advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.
               An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to
               this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and
               a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a
               draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.
               A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with
               empty shell casings around his body.

               Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to
               Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks
               gently to him in French.

               The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands
               and translates.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five nights ago, he found this
                         paratrooper caught in a tree with a
                         broken leg.  The leg got infected.
                         Last night he went to Ville Cholet
                         to get a doctor.  The doctor refused
                         to come and when he got back, this
                         is what he found.  The Krauts must
                         have shown up while he was gone.

                                     MILLER
                         Did he see any sign of them?

               Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.

                                     UPHAM
                         No, but he heard firing, just east,
                         less that a kilometer.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank him and tell him we're sorry
                         about his loss.

               Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.
               Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.

               Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his
               hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last
               of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.

               The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the
               edge of the field.

               Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches
               and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.

               Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to
               some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with
               bullets.

               Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.

                                     WADE
                         Captain.

               Staying low, they join Wade who has found:

               TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS

               A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.

               MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON

               Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow.  The
               others crawl up behind them.

                                     MILLER
                         Where?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the shadow by those two trees.

                                     MILLER
                         My guess, too.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is it?

                                     MILLER
                         A machine gun.

               Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover
               of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, I've got an idea, let's go
                         around.

                                     MILLER
                         We can't leave it here.

                                     JACKSON
                         We left them eighty-eights.

                                     MILLER
                         They don't send planes to put out
                         machine guns.
                              (beat)
                         Two flank runners with surpressing
                         fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes
                         left has to be fast.

               Upham steels himself and steps forward.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.

                                     REIBEN
                         He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

               Miller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer.

                                     WADE
                         How fast?

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-four-five.

                                     WADE
                         Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty-
                         two flat.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade goes left.

               Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is
               impressed.

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-two flat?

               Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.

                                     WADE
                         I would have won the states if some
                         bastard hadn't tripped me in the
                         finals.

               Miller points the others to their firing positions.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         ten yards, either side.

               As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,
               out of earshot of the men.

                                     SARGE
                         Rule of thumb, Captain, says you
                         ought to detail this one, instead of
                         going yourself.

               Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?

                                     SARGE
                         How about I go right, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         How about you take your position?

               Sarge hesitates.

                                     SARGE
                         How about...?

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         How about you shut up and take your
                         position?

               Sarge nods.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near
               Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.

                                     UPHAM
                         Good luck, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got
                         five lives.

                                     UPHAM
                         The men said, nine.

                                     MILLER
                         What do they know?
                              (beat)
                         I had nine, but I feel through the
                         ice when I was seven, my brother
                         pulled me out.  Then I used one when
                         a grenade landed in my foxhole in
                         Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one
                         on the beaches, one on the cliffs
                         and two getting here.

                                     UPHAM
                         That only leaves three.

                                     MILLER
                         Plenty.

               Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

                                     WADE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now.

               MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.

               Onto opposite sides of the field.  Nothing happens for a
               moment.  Then:

               A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.  MURDEROUSLY LOUD.

               SHATTERING THE QUIET.

                                     IN THE NEST
                         A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING
                         THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE
                         8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon.
                         Four Germans in the nest, four more
                         outlying riflemen.

                                     MILLER
                         Takes the FIRST FIRE.  He HITS THE
                         DIRT.  The BULLETS SCREAM just over
                         him.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPRINTS
               WADE HITS THE DIRT

               The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.

               SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM

               Zero the machine gun.  FIRE fast as they can.  Their BULLETS
               THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND
               SPRINTS MILLER HITS THE DIRT

               Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.
                         No effect.  Pissed.  POPS THE CLIP.
                         SLAMS in another.  FIRES.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER

               He rises and runs.  Fast.  Almost to the far hedgerow.

                                     WADE
                         Ten more yards.  Too slow.  A deadly
                         row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward
                         him.

                                     MILLER
                         Makes it to the far side.  Scrambles
                         up the roots.  Dives through the
                         brush.

                                     WADE
                         On a slight rise.  Can't hit the
                         dirt.  A line of bullets.  Desperately
                         sprints.

               WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.
               Goes down.

               SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified.  FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.
                         Stumbles onto the path.  Rolls to
                         his feet, running.  Swings his
                         Thompson into firing position.  Racing
                         toward the nest.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         Tearing along the path.  Sees a German
                         rifleman.  FIRES A BURST.  CUTS HIM
                         DOWN.  Runs over the body without
                         breaking stride.

               SARGE STEPS INTO THE OPEN, INTENTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN
               FIRE from Miller.

               The GERMANS ZERO SARGE.  BULLETS THUD all around him.  Somehow
               he's not hit.

                                     MILLER
                         TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.  BLASTS his
                         Thompson.  CUTS DOWN two more German
                         riflemen.  Grabs a grenade.  Pulls
                         the pin.

                                     THE NEST
                         The Germans see Miller coming.  Wheel
                         from Sarge.  Too late.

                                     MILLER
                         THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES.

               THE GRENADE EXPLODES.  The four Germans in the nest are
               KILLED.

               SARGE hollers to the others.

                                     SARGE
                         HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                                     MILLER
                         Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another
                         BURST.  KILLS the last of the German
                         riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto
                         the field.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS

               See Miller running toward Wade.  They instantly RACE onto
               the field.

                                     WADE
                         Lies in the grass.  Holding his belly.
                         Astonished by the pain.

               ALL THE AMERICANS RUN

               Converging on Wade.  Miller points, and yells, without slowing
               down.

                                     MILLER
                         REIBEN, UPHAM, PERIMETER!  COVER!

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Stop instantly.  Turn toward the
                         perimeter of the field.

                                     SARGE
                         Roots through his medical kit as he
                         runs.  Dropping and scattering
                         inessentials behind him.

                                     WADE
                         Wide-eyed.  Not even writhing.  Too
                         much pain.

               MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE

               Throw themselves onto the ground next to him.  They both
               tear out sulfa-packs.  Sarge frantically fumbles.  Ripping
               one open.  Powder spills.

               REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.

                                     SARGE
                         Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.
                         Pours sulfa powder.

                                     MILLER
                         About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the
                         wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.

                                     MILLER
                         Damn it!

               Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.

                                     SARGE
                         Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.

                                     SARGE
                         Sulfa, more sulfa...

                                     WADE
                         Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller.
                         Sees him preparing the morphine shot.
                         They both know.

                                     WADE
                         Yeah...morphine...make it a
                         double...huh...Captain...?

                                     MILLER
                         SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.
                         Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine
                         straight to Wade's brain.  Motions
                         impatiently to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         More morphine, hurry up, come on,
                         come on...

                                     SARGE
                         Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa.
                         Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the
                         morphine.

                                     MILLER
                         Snatches the morphine from Sarge.
                         Quickly and efficiently prepares a
                         second shot.  He's done this before.

                                     REIBEN
                         On guard, glancing back.  Pissed
                         off.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     UPHAM
                         Freaked out.  Trying to keep his
                         eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.

                                     JACKSON
                         Watching.

                                     MILLER
                         Gives Wade the second shot.

                                     WADE
                         Feels the effects of the first shot.
                         He sees Upham and manages a pained
                         smile.

               WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,
               without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE
               DIES

               ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE

               UPHAM begins to weep.

               REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently
                         closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers
                         slightly as he unclips one of Wades
                         dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.
                         Sarge notices.

               Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men
               see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.

               Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,
               rises and picks up his Thompson.

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         That was no twenty-two flat.

               Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.

                                     MILLER
                         He lied.  Let's move out.

               Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men
               hesitate, then slowly follow him.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY

               A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel.
               The five G.I.'s walk, spread out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him,
                         just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-
                         bitch.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shut up, will you?

                                     REIBEN
                         You shut up, this is the most fucked
                         up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned
                         Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

                                     JACKSON
                         Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         The hell he didn't.

               Miller motions to them curtly.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep it down.

               They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,
               the men don't hear.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to find someplace to hole
                         up for a bit.

               Sarge looks at Miller closely.

                                     SARGE
                         You alright?

                                     MILLER
                         Let's just find someplace.

               EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY

               Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good
               hiding place.

                                     MILLER
                         Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.
                         I'm going to re-con.

               Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but
               there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.
               He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.

               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY

               Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The
               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,
               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for
               faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,
               as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,
               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller
               senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a
               thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.

                                     MILLER
                         What was the name of that kid at
                         Anzio, the one who got his face burned
                         off?

                                     SARGE
                         Vecchio.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember
                         his name, he was a good kid, remember
                         how he used to walk on his hands and
                         sing that song about the man on flying
                         trapeze?

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah.

                                     MILLER
                         You know why I'm such a good officer?
                         Because of my mother.  Have I ever
                         told you about her?

                                     SARGE
                         Bits and pieces.

                                     MILLER
                         She's the best poker player you ever
                         saw.  My father used to go to these
                         Saturday night games and lose his
                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him
                         an ultimatum, either she gets a
                         regular seat at the table or she
                         locks him in every Saturday night.
                         He squawked and so did his buddies
                         but after a while they gave in and
                         from the first night she sat down,
                         she never lost.  She could read those
                         cocky bastards like they were playing
                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her
                         eyes, the tone of her voice, her
                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
                         her coffee, she was a master.  She
                         won more money on shit hands than
                         anyone in the history of the game.
                         Every Saturday night, my father would
                         lose two, three hundred bucks and
                         she'd win it all back and then some.
                         And I'd stand there, glued to her
                         shoulder, from the time I was five
                         years old, watching every hand, every
                         move, studying how she did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's why I'm such a good officer,
                         I can look at a man's face and tell
                         you exactly what he's holding, and
                         if it's a shit hand, I know just
                         what cards to deal him.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about your own hand?

                                     MILLER
                         No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?
                         So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear
                         me apart when I'd get one of my men
                         killed, but what was I supposed to
                         do?  Break down in front of the ones
                         who were standing there waiting for
                         me to tell them what to do?  Of course
                         not, so I bluffed, and after a while,
                         I started to fall for my own bluff.
                         It was great, it made everything so
                         much easier.  Sarge Is that why your
                         hand's been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         It could be worse.  You know the
                         first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?
                         Lie to your men.

                                     SARGE
                         Oh, yeah?

                                     MILLER
                         Not in so many words, but they tell
                         you you can have all the firepower
                         in the world and if your men don't
                         have good morale, it's not worth a
                         damn.  So if you're scared or empty
                         or half-a-step from a Section Eight,
                         do you tell your men?  Of course
                         not.  You bluff, you lie.

                                     SARGE
                         And how do you bluff yourself?

                                     MILLER
                         Simple, numbers.  Every time you
                         kill one of your men, you tell
                         yourself you just saved the lives of
                         two, three, ten, a hundred others.
                         We lost, what, thirty-one on the
                         cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times
                         that number by putting out those
                         guns.  That's over three hundred
                         men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.
                         Then thousand.  Any number you want.
                         See?  It's simple.  It lets you always
                         choose mission over men.

                                     SARGE
                         Except this time, the mission IS a
                         man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's
                         Ryan?  If they're both standing in
                         front of me and I have to shoot one
                         or the other, how do I choose?  Look
                         at my hand, there it goes again.

                                     SARGE
                         John, I've got to tell you, I think
                         you're about used up.

                                     MILLER
                         I think you're right, Keith.

                                     SARGE
                         You want me to take over?

               The question helps Miller pull himself back together.  He
               looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.

                                     MILLER
                         No, but if I get any worse, you'll
                         have to relieve me.

                                     SARGE
                              (sighs)
                         Just what I want to do.

               They share a smile.

                                     MILLER
                         You know Wade was the eleventh of
                         the twelve, you're the last one still
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         I know.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't let yourself get killed, if
                         you do, they might make me give back
                         the medal and then I won't be able
                         to lip off to colonels anymore.

                                     SARGE
                         I'll do my best.

               They shake their heads at the madness of it all.  Miller
               Hell of a...

                                     (BEAT)
                         Ah, forget it.

               Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting
               himself.  He's about ninety-five percent there.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks for drawing that machine gun
                         off me.

                                     SARGE
                         You're welcome, John.

                                     MILLER
                         But, that's my personal brand of
                         stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary
                         about it, if you do it again, you're
                         busted.

               Sarge allows himself a slight smile.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back
               to the men.

               EXT. CLEARING - DAY

               The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.
               No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.
               Miller barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Up.  We're moving out.

                                     REIBEN
                         I thought you said we had an hour,
                         sir?

                                     MILLER
                         Well now I'm saying we're moving
                         out.  Get off your ass.

               The men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow.

                                     MILLER
                         What the hell's the matter with you,
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on
                         account of Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Who's Wade?

               No one responds.

                                     MILLER
                         I said, who the hell is Wade?

               The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand what you're doin',
                         but I respectfully request permission
                         to grieve in my own manner.

                                     MILLER
                         You'll grieve the way I tell you to
                         goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade,
                         there was one, but he died a long
                         time ago, he's been dead for so long
                         you can hardly remember his name,
                         you understand?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand.  I don't like it,
                         but I understand.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, now get your goddamned gear.

               The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.
               Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his
               head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit
               to work.  He knows they have no choice.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent,
               grim.

               EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY

               Miller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds
               up the map, points the way and they move out.

               EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY

               More progress.  The men are still grim.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what the best possible thing
                         that could happen is?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get
                         lockjaw, never say another word as
                         long as you live.

               Miller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         I've given this a lot of thought,
                         sir.  The best thing that could happen
                         is, we find Ryan and he's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Why's that?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, consider the possibilities.
                         A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take
                         him back to the beach.  Knowing you,
                         you don't let him carry my gear,
                         even though he really should, and we
                         all get killed, trying to keep him
                         alive.

                                     MILLER
                         Except for the last part, that one's
                         not bad.

                                     REIBEN
                         B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown
                         up by the German equivalent of Wade,
                         whose name I know you don't want me
                         to mention.  There's nothing to find.
                         The biggest piece is the size of a
                         pea.  We wander around, looking for
                         him until the Germans pick us off,
                         one after another.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't like that one.

                                     REIBEN
                         Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is
                         the worst one, we find Ryan and he's
                         wounded.  Not only does he not carry
                         my gear, we have to carry his gear.
                         And him.

                                     MILLER
                         But we accomplish the mission.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe.  But what if he dies on the
                         way back?  you see what I'm saying,
                         sir?  The best possible situation
                         is, he's dead, we find his body,
                         more or less intact, we grab one of
                         his dog-tags and high-tail it back
                         to the beach, or better yet, we head
                         over to Caen and catch up with
                         division.

                                     MILLER
                         Has anyone ever told you, you're
                         officer material?

                                     REIBEN
                         No, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         That's a mystery to me.

               No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

               The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush
               near the crossroads.  A sign reads:  "Ramelle 3 Km."  Miller
               folds up the map.

                                     SARGE
                         Looks like we're going to beat those
                         Kraut companies to Ramelle.

               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something
               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they
               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't think so.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop
               trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack
               Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a
               bridge.

               CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL

               Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
               Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.

                                     GERMAN FLANK SQUADS
                         Hurry along the fields on either
                         side of the road, trying to keep up
                         with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS
                         MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching
                         German Flank Squad.  They flatten
                         themselves into the mucky water.
                         Ready their weapons.  Prepare to
                         fire.

                                     THE GERMAN SQUAD
                         Approaches the bridge.

               PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES

               See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.

                                     MILLER
                         Is just about to open up on them.

                                     THE GERMAN SERGEANT
                         Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind
                         and CALLS to them.

                                     THE GERMAN PRIVATES
                         Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the
                         convoy.

                                     IN THE CULVERT
                         The Americans breathe again.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wonder where they're going.

                                     MILLER
                         Same place we are.

               Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast
               is clear.  They head out.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY

               A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,
               cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone
               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.

               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the
               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.

               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD

               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Scans the Germans with his binoculars.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like tea time, maybe they're
                         Brits.

                                     UPHAM
                         I sure hope so.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think they're waiting
                         for, Captain?

               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more
               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER
               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know
               that sound, they don't like it.

               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS

               Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who
               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,
               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two
               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and
               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.
               There are four of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Puts away the binoculars and jerks
                         his head for his men to follow, low,
                         along the wall.  The men are happy
                         to do so, looking back nervously at
                         the German tanks.

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY

               The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is
               a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell
               casings and bodies, German and American and a few French
               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons
               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging
               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of
               the firing.

               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He
               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the
               firing.

               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY

               A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC
               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near
               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of
               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings
               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.
               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on
               both sides of the bridge.

               MILLER AND HIS MEN

               Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the
               bridge.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like they've been having a
                         hell of a party, here, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

               A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF
                         A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?

               Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty.

                                     MILLER
                         I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE
                         COME.
                              (to his men)
                         Cover me.

                                     REIBEN
                         What if our guys open up, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         You're only allowed to shoot at
                         Germans, that's one of the rules.

                                     REIBEN
                         Have it your way, Captain.

               Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward
               the bridge.

               THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP

               Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         POUR FIRE at the German positions,
                         SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.

                                     ON THE BRIDGE
                         The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM
                         OF BULLETS at the German positions.

               Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive
               jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.

               He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the
               young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are
               some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller
               catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to
               nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll keep it in mind.
                              (calls to Sarge)
                         OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.

               Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as
               they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.

               Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to
               hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days.

                                     MILLER
                         Things are tough all over.  We're
                         looking for a Private James Ryan.

               Forrest Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Is he here?

               Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.

               Forrest Go get Ryan.

                                     (TO MILLER)
                         What do you want him for, sir?

               Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and
               scrambles to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson, get a hold of command.

               Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to
               Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         How many men do you have?

               They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men
               to leap over the barricade.

               Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge
               was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
               ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

               Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's
               hailing I.D.   No response.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep trying.

               Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

               Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:

                                     PRIVATE JAMES RYAN
                         Dashing from cover to cover, making
                         his way toward them.  Ryan is an
                         American classic, nineteen years
                         old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.
                         Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and
                         smeared with dirt and blood, he's
                         very alive.  His eyes shine, his
                         face has a spark.  You can't help
                         but love this kid.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         All watch Ryan run toward them.

                                     JACKSON
                         So, that's Ryan.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
               barricade.  He salutes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see
                         me?

               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally
               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,
               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.
               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers
               have been killed in action.

               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.
               Somehow he remains upright.

               Ryan All three?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes.

               Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning
               him against some sandbags.

                                     THE PARATROOPERS
                         Are stunned at the news.  They look
                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they
                         can do.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         Also look at Ryan, but then, one
                         after another, they turn away,
                         adverting their eyes, looking a their
                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,
                         the sky, anything other than Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         We've been sent to get you out of
                         here.  You're going home.

               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and
               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a
               little room.

               Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm
                         taking you and your men with me.

               Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this
               bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-
               ninth Division.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.

               Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm not going to leave you and your
                         men here to get killed.  Get them
                         together, we're moving out.

               A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.

                                     RYAN (O.S.)
                         No, sir.

               They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about
               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on
               the arm and speaks softly to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Come on, Private, you're going home.

               Ryan jerks away from Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         No, sir.

               All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.

                                     MILLER
                         Private.  I'm sorry about your
                         brothers but staying here and getting
                         yourself killed isn't going to help.

                                     RYAN
                         Sir, if the Krauts are holding this
                         bridge when division shows up, our
                         guys are going to be sitting ducks.

                                     MILLER
                         This bridge cannot be held.  The
                         Germans have two companies less than
                         three miles from here.  They have
                         tanks.

               That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,
               but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.

               Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.

                                     MILLER
                         Private, if you want to commit
                         suicide, that's your choice, but
                         you're going to have to wait until
                         after I get you back to the beach.
                         And you're not going to take these
                         men with you.

               Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm not leaving, sir.

               Miller starts to boil over.

                                     MILLER
                         The hell you aren't, you're comin'
                         with me if I have to drag you every
                         inch of the way.  You hear me,
                         Private?

                                     RYAN
                         I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

               Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't
               resist.

                                     MILLER
                         Listen you little son-of-a-bitch
                         you're coming with me or
                         I'll...I'll...

               Ryan speaks softly.

                                     RYAN
                         What are you going to do, sir, shoot
                         me?

               Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind
               Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Uh, excuse me, Captain.

               Miller slowly turns and glares.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         So, what are a few tanks, sir?

               Miller's more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         He's right, we can't shoot him...well,
                         we could but we'd get in an enormous
                         amount of trouble.  And he's right
                         about the bridge, it's a hell of a
                         lot more important than he is.

               JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n...?

               Miller turns his glare on Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                              (continuing)
                         Seems to me, we got us a opportunity,
                         here, to kill two birds with one
                         stone.  Command seems to think keepin'
                         this boy alive is worth somethin'.
                         If we was to do that and hold this
                         bridge, good chance we'd get us a
                         bucket full of medals.  I might even
                         get me one 'a them big, fancy ones
                         like you got, so's I could sass any
                         officer in the whole dang army, you
                         included.

               Miller does a slow burn.

               UPHAM STEPS FORWARD

                                     UPHAM
                         I'd like to stay, too, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         You don't count.

               SARGE STEPS UP

                                     SARGE
                         I do and personally, I'd rather get
                         the hell out of here, but somebody's
                         got to stay and take care of you and
                         these pin-head privates of yours.

               Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.

               Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir.

               Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                         See, Captain?  The vote's unanimous.

               Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote?
               What the hell are you talking about?  We don't vote.  This
               isn't a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you
               follow them.  We don't vote!

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely
                         speaking hypothetically.  IF this
                         was a voting situation, then the
                         vote would have been unanimous.  But
                         of course, it's not a voting
                         situation, you're the captain, and
                         you give the orders, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         You're goddamned right, I give the
                         order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen
                         to me, you little pissant pieces of
                         shit, I am the ranking officer here
                         and what I say goes, is that clear?

               They all quickly nod.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Of course, sir.

               All the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

               Miller looks from face to face.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case...
                              (beat)
                         I vote we stay.

               That's what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn't give them
               time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson,
                         get up on the bridgekeepers hut with
                         your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and
                         Upham move that machine gun so it
                         can cover the left flank, it's
                         worthless where it is.  Forrest, I
                         want a full inventory of all your
                         weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go.

               They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller
               for a moment.

                                     RYAN
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                              (gruffly gentle)
                         Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next
                         to me, no matter where I go, you
                         understand?

               Ryan salutes.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright, come with me.

               Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check
               the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

               Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other
               paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.

               Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon
               grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy
               guns and about sixty rounds per man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's it?

               Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, can I change my vote?

               Miller sighs, worried.

               EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT - DAY

               Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a
               crescent of sandbags.  His eye is at his scope.  He FIRES.

                                     A GERMAN SNIPER
                         Falls from a window on the edge of
                         town, dead.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sits beside Jackson with a pair of
                         binoculars, searching for another
                         target.  The German sniper fire has
                         subsided for now.  Ext. bridge - day
                         Miller watches as Ryan and several
                         other paratroopers dig a series of
                         trenches across the street, leading
                         to the bridge.

               Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.

               Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head.  He speaks
               to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, see what you can do to make
                         those buildings inhospitable.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE
               DISTANCE.  They all turn at the sound.

                                     UPHAM
                         Eighty-eights, right?

               Miller nods.

                                     UPHAM
                         I can tell what the gunners had for
                         dinner.

                                     MILLER
                         Those guns are close.

               Forrest Just south of town.  The Krauts have a two gun
               emplacement, we saw it on the way in.  That's how we knew
               they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out
               of us.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope they don't change their
                         mind.

               Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.

               INT. BUILDING - DAY

               Within sight of the bridge.  Sarge carefully plants a wire-
               triggered satchel charge at the door of the building.  He
               sets the wire, then carefully backs away.

               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

               Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine
               gun nest.  Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham
               at his side.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think?

                                     MILLER
                         Well, if we had ten times the men
                         and a lot more ammo, we might stand
                         a chance, but not against those tanks.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we going to do?

                                     MILLER
                         We're going to hope like hell the
                         tanks were on their way somewhere
                         else.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe Caen.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope, because we're sure as
                         hell not going to do any damage to
                         them with what we have here.

                                     UPHAM
                         What about our grenades?

                                     MILLER
                         Those are Tigers, they have six-inch
                         armor, they don't even notice
                         grenades.

                                     UPHAM
                         Would they notice and eighty-eight?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, you got one?

                                     UPHAM
                         The Germans do.

               Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, go find Jackson, he and I are
                         going hunting.

               Upham runs off.  Sarge shakes his head.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, oh.

                                     MILLER
                         Out of the mouth of babes.

               EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT

               Dark.  Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with
               blackening soot.  The rest of Miller's men and several
               paratroopers, including Ryan, look on.  Upham is distressed.
               Upham It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, you've got to learn the
                         difference between whining and
                         griping.  You can't just rely on
                         natural ability, you've got to study
                         and practice.

                                     UPHAM
                         But, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         There you go again, that's whining,
                         that's not okay.

                                     UPHAM
                         Goddamn it, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         That's better, but you've still got
                         a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben,
                         he's a natural and works at it, he'll
                         give you some pointers.

                                     REIBEN
                         Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have
                         him pissing and moaning with the
                         best of us.

                                     MILLER
                         See to it.

               RYAN Steps up to Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'd like to go, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         No, private, I want you to stay here,
                         keep your head down, don't do anything
                         brave or stupid.

                                     REIBEN
                         Aren't they the same thing, sir?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I don't know what I'd do
                         without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close
                         to you and alive.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         You ready?

               Forrest Yes, sir.

                                     JACKSON
                         You betcha, sir.

               Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out.

                                     REIBEN
                              (southern accent)
                         Y'all come back.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the
                         way I talk?

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy southern accent)
                         Hell, no!

               Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest
               into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the
               night.  It's eight-man crew re-loads.

                                     IN THE DARKNESS
                         A slight movement.  It's Miller.  He
                         crawls to the edge of the emplacement
                         and freezes in the shadows.

               A moment later he's joined by Forrest.  A moment after that,
               Jackson silently crawls up to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a
                         weakness.  There is none.  He motions
                         to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The
                         three of them settle into the
                         darkness.

               EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan
               is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller's
               men eye him.

                                     SARGE
                         Private, I'm sorry about your
                         brothers.

               Ryan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip
               from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was
               the name of the guy who got killed coming up here?

                                     SARGE
                         Wade.

                                     RYAN
                         Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here
                         to keep me alive...I never met
                         him...he didn't know me from Adam,
                         strange.  What was he like?

                                     SARGE
                         A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben,
                         here, used to call him a happy idiot.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell, I did.

                                     RYAN
                         My brothers would be mighty pissed
                         off at me, if they knew I let some
                         guy get killed trying to keep me
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         You didn't let anybody get killed,
                         you didn't even know we were coming
                         up here.

                                     RYAN
                         Sure, I know, but...
                              (sighs)
                         Goddamn it all...

               The others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               Dark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch.

                                     A SHADOW
                         It's Miller.  Easing through the
                         darkness.  Closer to one of the
                         sentries.

               Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller
               nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the
               sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS.

                                     BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.

                                     A GERMAN SENTRY
                         Approaches.  He sees Forrest.  Just
                         as he's about to open up with his
                         sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him
                         from behind, STABS him, eases the
                         body silently to the ground.

                                     MILLER AND JACKSON
                         Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.

               Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the
               German's truck.

                                     ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY
                         Rounds a corner.  Sees them.  OPENS
                         UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.

               Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.

                                     OTHER GERMANS
                         Race over, FIRING.

                                     JACKSON
                         Covering them, OPENS UP.  Kills the
                         advancing Germans.

               MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.

               FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.

               JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.

               Spins.

               Still FIRING.

               Giving Miller cover.

               MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.

               JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.

               JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.

                                     THE WINDSHIELD
                         Is shattered by bullets.

               Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.

                                     FORREST
                         In the back of the truck.

               Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.

               MILLER FLOORS IT.

               The truck DRIVES through the Germans.

               The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.
               MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST Drive into the night.

               The Germans FIRING after them.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a
               gauntlet of Germans.  As they approach the bridge, the other
               American's FIRE COVER for them.

               Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.

               SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS

               THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the
               barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         RYAN!  GET BACK THERE!

               Ryan ignores him.  They get the eighty-eight safely behind
               the barricade.  Miller grabs Ryan.

                                     RYAN
                         Sorry, sir.

               Miller fumes.  he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging,
               clearly not pissed at Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't do that again.

                                     RYAN
                         I won't need to sir, it's already
                         here, behind the barricade so...

               Miller GROWLS.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine.  Very
               gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt.  They cover it and
               step back carefully.

               Then they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their
               tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll
               place the rest of the mines.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Quiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There's nothing to do
               now but wait.

               ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT

               Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see
               Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning
               the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.

                                     REIBEN
                         What do you think?

                                     JACKSON
                         I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

                                     REIBEN
                         I mean, Ryan, what do you think of
                         him?

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't half-bad, I guess.

                                     REIBEN
                         I guess.

               They're quiet for a moment.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         Nope, he ain't Wade.

               Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs through the shadows and
                         stops at the bridgekeepers hut.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben...

               Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun
               nest.

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir.

               REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.

               MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in
               the rear machine gun nest.

                                     MILLER
                         You set?  Sarge nods.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to
               check the others.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN

               First light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE
               them in their positions:

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Manning the forward machine gun nest.

                                     JACKSON
                         Behind the sandbags, on top of the
                         bridgekeeper's hut.

               FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS

               Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward
               and the rear machine gun nests.

                                     RYAN AND SARGE
                         Manning rear machine gun.

                                     MILLER
                         At the bridgehead, waiting.

               SOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD

               All eyes turn.

               SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER

               Dashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant.
               Then another.  And another.

                                     MILLER
                         Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down
                         behind some sandbags.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE THEY COME!

               A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.

               THE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE

                                     REIBEN
                         OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         At least fifty of them, advancing on
                         the bridge.  Running from cover to
                         cover.  A squad pushing a French
                         truck, using it as a shield.

                                     JACKSON
                         Calmly picking off the attacking
                         Germans.

                                     THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN
                         Make their way down the streets.
                         Along the riverbank.  Through the
                         houses.  There are GERMANS FIRING
                         from all directions.

               REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off.
                         Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Running out of ammo.  See that there's
                         nothing else they can do.

                                     REIBEN
                         Time to go.

               Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.
               Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as
               they can.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER

               REIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up.
               Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him.

               They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.

               DIVE OVER.  The Germans are almost on them.

                                     RYAN IS FIRING
                         With the rear MACHINE GUN.  Drops
                         several Germans.

                                     GERMANS EVERYWHERE
                         They swarm over the first barricade.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES A BURST into a German's belly.
                         HITS another with the stock of his
                         Thompson.

               HAND-TO-HAND.

               FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

               FIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a
               flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks.  Two of
               the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.  THE
               PARATROOPERS see the grenades.  Too late.

               THE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER
               PARATROOPERS RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE

               No time to react.

                                     HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING
                         Half a dozen Germans break through.

               Miller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST.

                                     RYAN
                         Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES.
                         KILLS the German.

                                     MILLER
                         Struggling with a pair of Germans.

                                     JACKSON
                         FIRES.  Drops one of the Germans on
                         Miller with a head shot.  Cuts open
                         Miller's face with bits of skull.

                                     RYAN
                         Leaps onto the final German attacking
                         Miller.  That German raises his rifle
                         on Ryan.

               UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON

               All see it.  SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.

                                     THE STUNNED GERMAN
                         About to kill Ryan.  Torn apart by
                         bullets from three directions.

                                     UPHAM
                         I got him.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell you did, I got him.

                                     JACKSON SMILES
                         He got him.

               MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip.  FIRES an arc.  DROPS four
               Germans.  Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS.  BARKS to Reiben
               and Upham:

                                     MILLER
                         BACK!  LET'S GO!

               They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make
               it to the barricade.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees them in deep trouble.  Leaves
                         Ryan firing the rear machine gun.
                         Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING
                         COVER.  Exposed.

                                     BULLETS EVERYWHERE
                         MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the
                         barricade.  Dive over.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees they've made it.  FIRES A FINAL
                         BURST.  Races for cover.  A trail of
                         bullets right behind him.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth.  Trying to
               cover Sarge.  Too many Germans.

               SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK.  FALLS.  MILLER AND THE OTHERS
               continue to fire, horrified.

               SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET

               Cradling the B.A.R.  Stumbling toward cover.  Slowing.
               Bleeding.

                                     THE AMERICANS
                         Desperately trying to cover him.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Open up with a volley.

                                     SARGE
                         Is almost there.

               ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE

               As best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It's not enough.

                                     SARGE
                         Five feet from the sandbags, his
                         back is TORN APART by Germans fire.
                         He looks down, stunned at his chest.
                         Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An
                         instant of surprise, more than fear.

               He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls
               onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies.
               THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Who killed Sarge are killed.  The
                         others back off for now.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the
                         barricade.  Sees that he's dead.

               THE GERMANS RETREAT.

               Around the corner.

                                     MILLER
                         Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling
                         next to him.

                                     THE OTHERS
                         Watch, start to gather.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Get back to your positions!

               They hesitate.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

               They follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn't move.
               He can't take his eyes off Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Doesn't move.  He just stares at
                         Sarge's body.

                                     RYAN
                         Looks at Miller, sees him growing
                         weak, starting to sway.  He gently
                         tries to move Miller aside.

                                     RYAN
                         I'll take care of Sarge...

               Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller
               grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made
               as he kneeled over Wade's body.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?  Who's Sarge?

               But this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The
               hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's
               called his own bluff.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Dark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once.

               Waiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have
               tightened their perimeter.

               Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously.

               They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper.

               Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:

                                     MILLER
                         English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania.

               Slowly, Miller's men turn to him.

                                     UPHAM
                         What'd you say, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I teach English at Addley High School
                         in Addley, Pennsylvania.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Like hell, you did.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, what about our deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I changed my mind.

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I coach the baseball team, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         No kiddin'?

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     UPHAM
                         Forget it.

               They all sit in silence.

                                     MILLER
                         You know that cruise ship Wade's
                         grandfather was on?

               They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's
               talking about.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         I wonder if his cabin is still
                         available?

                                     REIBEN
                         That's not where I am.  Miller No?
                         Where are you?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm in a dressing room with Mrs.
                         Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife.
                         She's an easy forty-four, double E,
                         but I've convinced her she's a thirty-
                         eight D and I'm watching her try and
                         squeeze herself into a side-stay,
                         silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle
                         with s Helf-lift brassiere.
                              (smiles)
                         She's having a devil of a time,
                         getting into that thing.

               They all share Reiben's dream for a moment.  Then Jackson
               smiles.

                                     JACKSON
                         Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy,
                         it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and
                         we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a
                         flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...

                                     REIBEN
                         Jackson, how many times I got to
                         tell you, you're from Tennessee.

                                     JACKSON
                         I am, but I like imported whiskey.
                         So there I am and I hear the biggest
                         ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a
                         rustlin' right there in front of me.
                         That ole' boy comes right out of the
                         brush, I got a clear shot and he
                         knows he's 'bout to meet his maker.
                         I aim, I got my finger tight on the
                         trigger and then I just smile and
                         say to that ole' coon, go on, now,
                         you get out 'a here.  Then I sit
                         down on a hollow log and take me a
                         right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

               Upham smiles.

                                     UPHAM
                         I don't know, I kind of like Wade's
                         idea about the cruise ship.  I've
                         never been to Tahiti.

                                     REIBEN
                         What about you, Captain?

               Miller smiles.  He knows exactly where he is.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm in my backyard, lying in my
                         hammock, with my arm around my wife,
                         listening for the sound of breaking
                         glass.

                                     JACKSON
                         Say what, Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         You see, I've got the best house in
                         all of Addley.  It's not the biggest
                         house, but it's got the best location,
                         right next to the junior high baseball
                         field.  The garage windows face left
                         field.  The guy who owned the house
                         before me had these heavy screen S
                         put over them.  The first thing I
                         did when I bought the place was take
                         off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-
                         two yards from home plate to my garage
                         windows.  It takes a hell of a junior
                         high kid to hit a ball that far.  I
                         look at my garage windows as a
                         Motivator and a way to scout the
                         kids coming up, the ones who are
                         going to give us a shot at the state
                         championship.  I lay there in my
                         hammock and every time I hear the
                         sound of breaking glass, I know we're
                         one step closer to winning it all.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't that get kind of expensive,
                         Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         It's worth it.

                                     JACKSON
                         To each, his own.

               They're all silent for a moment.  Then Miller turns to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         How about you, James?

               Ryan sighs.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm home, playing basketball with my
                         brothers, it's evenin' time, we're
                         trying' to get in a few more points
                         before it's too dark to see the ball.
                         That's where I am.

               They all nod.  Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes
               it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on.  They all
               eat in silence.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN

               First light.  Lovely.  Dew shimmers.  A ground fog drifts.
               A SOUND.  Louder.  And louder.  A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES
               toward the village.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAWN

               All are awake.  At their positions.  Waiting.

                                     MILLER
                         Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF
                         THE TANK.  Barely has time to react.
                         Sees:

               THE GERMANS ADVANCING AGAIN

                                     MILLER
                         Here they come.

                                     REIBEN
                         FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

               THE GERMANS KEEP COMING

               Lots of them.  Moving from cover to cover.  FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         Manning the forward machine gun.
                         Way out front.  Sees that he's going
                         to be cut off.  He grabs the hot
                         gun.  The barrel burns into his flesh.
                         He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK
                         toward the bridge.

               HE DIVES over the sandbags.  barely makes it.  TRAILED BY
               BULLETS.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions near the bridge.
                         Moving in.  FIRING.  Overwhelming.
                         They're everywhere.

                                     THREE GERMANS
                         Break through the perimeter.

               RYAN SHOOTS one.  GRAPPLES with the other two.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one
                         German.  STABS the other.

               RYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt.

               REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE
               GUN.

               OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A
               LONG BURST.  Germans drop.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES again.  More Germans drop.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions in the building near
                         the bridge.

               They start working their way to the tops of the nearby
               buildings.

               Making their way along the riverbanks.

                                     REIBEN AND RYAN
                         Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding
                         the ammo belt.

                                     REIBEN
                         MORE AMMO!

                                     UPHAM
                         Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He
                         grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS
                         toward Reiben and Ryan.

               SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM

               OPEN UP on him.

               BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there.

                                     UPHAM
                         TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart.
                         Stumbles the final few steps to the
                         machine gun nest.  Falls on the
                         sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the
                         ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD.

               RYAN STUNNED.

               For just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN
               FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the
               one almost out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the
                         advancing Germans.

               THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK

                                     MILLER
                         Knows what that means.  He hears the
                         RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.

                                     MILLER
                         TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME!

                                     RYAN AND REIBEN
                         Immediately grab the machine gun and
                         ammo and race back to the rear nest.

               Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST
               TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two
               German infantry platoons.

                                     JACKSON
                         On the bridgekeeper's hut.  Picking
                         off German soldiers who follow the
                         tank.

               A GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON.  Hollers into the tanks
               voice-tube.

                                     THE TANK
                         Stops.  Grinds its gears.  Turning
                         it's turret towards the bridgekeepers
                         hut.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON!

                                     JACKSON
                         Knows what's coming but he holds his
                         position, continuing to pick off
                         German soldiers.

                                     THE TANK BLASTS
                         THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON
                         ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         SEE JACKSON DIE.  A bare moment to
                         react.  Then, they turn their
                         attention back to the eighty-eight.
                         Frantically turning the aiming cranks.
                         Lowering the barrel to point blank.

               TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               Which can fire first.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Win the race.

                                     FIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         BLAST THE LEAD TANK DESTROY IT IN A
                         SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Quickly reload the eighty-eight.
                         FIRE AGAIN.

               DESTROY THE SECOND TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech
                         of the eighty-eight.  Pats Ryan on
                         the back.  Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE.

               RUNS down the bridge.  Right toward the two advancing tanks.

                                     RYAN
                         FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               DESTROYING THE THIRD TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Races through the debris.  Trailed
                         by BULLETS.

                                     REIBEN
                         With the machine gun.  Covers Miller.
                         Keeping most of the German infantry
                         down.

               RYAN jumps behind the second machine gun.  Opens up.  Helping
               to cover Miller.

               THE LAST GERMAN TANK

               Turret spins.  Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.
               Ready to blow him to bits.

                                     MILLER
                         Is almost there.  He arms the satchel
                         charge.

               THE TIGER'S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.

               BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS

                                     MILLER
                         Throws the satchel charge under the
                         tank.  Rolls off the edge of the
                         bridge.  Lands on the embankment
                         below.

               THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES

               MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.

               Almost out of ammo.

               MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge,
               hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!

               Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.

               A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard
               yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Goddamn it!

                                     REIBEN
                         More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them
                         The fear on their faces turns to
                         resignation.  They know that they
                         are dead men.  They settle into their
                         positions, and prepare to fire and
                         die.

               They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

               THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a
               smile...then a real smile...

               AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise.  Then
               ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...

               MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN

               Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along
               with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.

               They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after
               wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a
               few among the departing Germans.

                                     THE ADVANCING TROOPS
                         Run onto the bridge and start to
                         secure the position.  A SERGEANT and
                         a few of HIS MEN look around,
                         curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and
                         Ryan, battered and bloody, standing
                         among the bodies.

               A MAJOR strides up.

               Major Report, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,
                         that's Private Richard Reiben and
                         that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-
                         and-First Airborne.

               The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Ryan?

               One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

               Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.

               The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

               Major Command is looking for you, son.  You're going home.

               Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.

               EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY

               American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the
               road and over the bridge.

               MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN

               Watch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies
               of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers
               are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.

               Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if
               they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by
               any of the advancing troops or vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down
                         next to Sarge and looks at him for a
                         long moment.  Then, with a steady
                         hand, he takes one of Sarge's two
                         dog-tags.  Then he does the same to
                         Jackson and Upham.

               REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands and walks back to Reiben and
                         Ryan.  He hands the dog-tags to Ryan
                         who grips them tightly and nods in
                         thanks.

               Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then
               he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let's move out.

               Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller
               down the road, away from the bridge.

                                     CAMERA CRANES UP
                         The three dirty, bloodied, tired men
                         walk down the road, ignored by the
                         fresh troops marching in the opposite
                         direction.

                                     RYAN
                         Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, Private.

                                     RYAN
                         Upham and Jackson, what were they
                         like?

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was
                         writing a book.

                                     RYAN
                         Yeah?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the
                         220 in twenty-four-five.

                                     RYAN
                         No kidding.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,
                         he was going to be a preacher, his
                         father and uncles have a traveling
                         ministry out of the back of a stretch
                         Hudson.

                                     RYAN
                         And Sarge?

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?
                              (beat)
                         He was the best friend I ever had.
                              (smiles)
                         Lemme tell you about Sarge...

               They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds
               and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the
               road and over the bridge.

               Fade out.

               THE END -

         1       A PROLOGUE                                                     1

                                               NARRATOR
                              In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
                              effort to normalize relations with
                              the Carter Administration -- opened
                              the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
                              apparent intention of letting some
                              of his people join their relatives
                              in the United States. Within seventy-
                              two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
                              for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it
                              became evident that Castro was forcing
                              the boat owners to carry back with
                              them not only their relatives but the
                              dregs of his jail population. 3y the
                              time the port was closed 125,000
                              'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
                              An estimated 25,000 had criminal
                              records.   This is the story of that

    Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
    in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
    now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny

                             TONY
             That Bogart, Chico, hunh?

                     That gold dust blowing in the wind.
                     Y'see Manny, he's always looking
                     over his shoulder. Hunh?   Like me....
         He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
         imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
         zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
         Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
         pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die."
         And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
         more pronounced.

                  Oye    Chi-Chi, what's             going    down.

        As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
        for Manny.  "Later."

        He's in the middle of the "Boulevard" where a bustling black
        market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transves-
        tites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack
        neon.

        He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
        past a "Viva Carter!" proclamation in graffiti....

            Tony,     five     minutes        later,        in   a   phone    booth, in    the    middle     of
  ._        a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
            trying     still      to        contact    somebody      --    anybody    --   on    the   outside.

            Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
            number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he
            finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
            a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
            standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
            shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
            handling.   Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
            rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
            not yet seen in Tony.
            Someone     picks      up        the     phone. An older woman's Voice.                    His
            expression         alters         to     uncertainty.
                                                            VOICE
                             Yes? ..Hello?..Who                is this?
            Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those
            in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
            ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
            pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
            He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes
            somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over.

            Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
            the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
            worn phone book in his hand.
                                                            TONY

     Tony     winks    and   walks   off.

     The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or
     Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack.  Tony loves the
     sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling
     his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny
     and Angel.

                 Bey that's not cool, man. You wanna
                 score one of these chicks, watch
                 me. Mira!
       He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
       whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
       the flick of an eye.

       Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
       peeking out of a nest iin his teeth, then it's gone.

                 What the hell's that for -- eating

                 crazy.   They don't resist me.
       Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
       provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a
       shop window.

       Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

                     No problem.

       Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking .out his arm
       and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
       give a shit.
                                                  TONY
                       Come     on?
       Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
       car screeching to a halt in front of him.

                                                  TONY

                       Okay Rober Retfor,               strut your stuff.
       The    blonde    has     paused    to     look    in   a    shop    window.

       Manny stops alongside, pretends to                          look.    When he catches
       her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

       She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
       Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

       Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
       child, four, toddling along with it's'mom.  Be makes his
       own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
       him puzzled. Tony produces another face.   The kid now
       smiles.  The mother looks over.  Tony shrugs.  She smiles
       and moves along.

       Meanwhile,       Manny    has     moved     close      to    the    blonde    and   suggests
       something,    his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It
       takes a    moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
       and walks        away.
       Tony     walks    over     to     him,    mocking.

           casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
           around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.

           friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.

     looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
     intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
     between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon
     from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the
     wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor...with
     him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana.
     In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline,
     flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

     The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
     Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails,
     and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the
     Toad, about five-two.
     The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

      Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
      the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.

                 Hello, Marta.
     She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
     television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
     intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.

     It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a
     move somewhere off-center andis now sitting on the bed,
     coiled and always watching.

     There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then
     commotion.
                                ANGEL
                Tony!
     Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
      female shriek, like a bird.

       She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the
       eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to
       Shoot.


       The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back,
       approaches Tony.
       Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
       Columbians, "The Kids". They slam the door, both carrying
       Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four    (Xl
       or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair
       cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little
       pirranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard
       in fast Columbese slang.
       As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

                                   TONY
                   Frog face, you just fucked up.     You
                   steal from me, you're dead.
       Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

                                   TOAD
                   Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the
                   cash or am I gonna kill your brother

                   Try sticking your head up your ass.
                   See if it fits.
       Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
       taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
       in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
       into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
       Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
       pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed.  Toad begin6
       assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun,
       completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on
       the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami,
       is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

     Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the
     shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the
     bathtub.   Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

     Tony, coverd by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
     bathroom.   He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
     pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
     Angel      looks at Tony; the             eyes          between   them         steady.     They're
     dead     and they know it.

     Toad,   well-prepared, connects                     a     voltage    adapter and
     extension cord.

                                                TOAD

                       happen to you, you get the money.

     Lizard reenters            the room, shakes her head                      at     the     Toad   who
     nods and turns             on the whirring machine.
     The Toad smiles            amiably       and       angles    the chainsaw              slowly
     towards Angel.
     The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at                                            his
     brains...o.c. we know what's happening as we hear the

     The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his
     shirt, examjning  his first cut like a butcher. He glances
     at Tony.

     Toad's      eyes     narrow        meanly.

     Kid   one    slaps         the    tape       across       Tony's        mouth.

     Kid two      reaches        up     to       tighten       the     overhead          strap       to    Tony's

     The Toad turns on his                       chainsaw          when    suddenly           there's       a
     gunshot from the hall.

45   INT./EXT.       TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
     shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She
     crashes backwards into the room, wounded.  Everything
     happens very fast now.
     Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid
     one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck.

     Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the
     unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling
     across   the bathroom.
     The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny.

     Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards.
     Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side.

     The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
     him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as
     Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
      In sharp f-g., the                 Lizard         crumples          forward        on    her        knees,
      foaming blood.

      Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes
      kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the
      stock of his own Ingram.

      In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with
                  strength, he tears out the motel room door
      hysterical
      gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

     Chi-Chi     climbing         through     the        window     fires    at        him.

     Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
     a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-
     second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine
     pistol.

     He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten
     craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

     Tony,     yelling, whirls              after     the    Toad.

                       I   got him!

     Manny, holding his side, empties                         his    pistol       on     kid      one     who
     is still twitching.
     Chi-Chi     sees       Angel,         gags.

     The senior citizens, playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter
     in astonishment.
     As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,                                         blood       flying,
     chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

     Their      eyes       follow.

     As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set
     in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
     There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
     that counts.  He stands behind the Toad.

                                                    TONY

                       Your'turn,   cabron!...
     The     Toad   whips         around     to    the     voice, eyes          stark       with        terror.
     Tony      empties      the     clip     into    the     Toad,       blowing       hiin      apart.
     The bystanders just                   stare, stunned           by    the      ferocity.            Then
     an old lady faints.
     The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
     turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
     audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
     and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi-
     fication.

     Tony    strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies
     and    busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which
     the    Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in

     A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security

     dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat
     preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Max-my with a phony
     effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now

     'with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
      Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without
     rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the
     impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

     Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a
     cautious cat is his ninteen-year-old sister Gina.  Their

     curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
     large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.

     exquisite peral   necklace.  She stares at it, doesn't take
     it.   Gina comes over, takes it for her.

 CUT TO INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93 Subtitle     appears:

 COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with "Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face.   He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

     Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
     lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with mas,sive  iron
     kettles bubbling with coca paste...across  to a row of ovens
     where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
     working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey" as he
     passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his
     vineyard.

 SOSA                            so this and my other factory 1 can

                       kilos refined every month   of the
                       year.   Problem is I have no steady
                       market.    Some months I can't get rid
                       of fifty keys, other months I have to
                       do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh?
                       Nobody can run a business that way ---

 OMAR                        I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got
                       the same problems up in Miami, the
                       demand varies for us too, month to
                       month....
     Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on.   In his
     skinny  suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
     nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

     Tow, awed by the scope of it all,               follows   along,   stops    to
     look at a sample of the dried coke.
     The      Shadow     stops,   eyeballs    him.

     Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
     samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause.                       His
     expression says I like it.   He moves on.
     The Shadow moves with him.

                       ...Basically what I'm looking for is

     At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony.     The Shadow sits impas-
     sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar
     and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the
     glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
     He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements
     of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con-
     stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

         Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe
         assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his
         brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

     same stony, loyal expression.
     Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
     A beat. He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.

 OMAR                Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of

               authority to buy 200 keys, that's it,
               that's my limit.    I got no right to
               negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything
               larger than that. So why don't we...
 TONY                Hey Omar why don't you let the man
               finish, hunh? Let him propose his
               proposition.

 OMAR                Hey Montana, you got no authority here,
               okay ! I started you in this business,
               all right, so shut the fuck UQ!

                 Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.
                 The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
                 polo players exercising in the distance...a woman on a
                 horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.
                 Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda
                 where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.

       There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's 'cause just
       the eyes do the smiling.

 TONY                         Talk about what, what's there to
                        talk about? I ain't killed anybody

          He winks and         goes. Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes
          flicking back        to the dance floor.

           Burgundy suit there is snuggling up to Gina on the dance

      There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.  Tony
      moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
      the door.
      It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
      burgundy suit running his ha&s along her ass.

                some air....
      The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
      the hallway. Several more people are watching.
 GINA                 You got a nerve, Tony, you got a
                nerve!   You can't tell me what to
                do.   I'll do what I want to do.

                want to fuck them then 1'11 fuck
                them!

      Tow, raging, smacks her            the face.    She reels back
                                across
      into the toilet.
                             Tony stands there, abated.
      The crowd is silent.
      Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina
      who is sobbing.

                Come on, baby, it's okay. .-it's

                Get her home, get her outta here!
      He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
      no regrets, but disturbed.
      Manny helps Gina to her feet.

                Come on, pussycat,    I'll buy you    a
                cup of coffee.

 CUT TO 111 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 111       Manny drives Gina home in his two-seater Mercedes sports
      coupe.  She's still angry.
 GINA                    ...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
                Mama's right. She says he hurts every-
                thing he touches. Well he's not gonna
                hurt me anymore. He`ll never see me
                again. Never!

                  He loves you, what do you want. He
                  feels he raised you.
 GINA                   He still thinks I'm fifteen. He's been
                  in jail five years and he still thinks
                  I'm fifteen!

                  Hey,    you're the best thing he's got.
                  The    only thing. He don't want you to
                  grow    up to be like him. So he's got

      challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in
      his terror.
      She gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights,
      towards the house, looking at him.
      He watches.
 CUT BACK TO 113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113       The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting    to
      Sinatra's "Strangers In The Night'.
 OWNER                   All right, you coneheads, another
                  exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?             (X)
                  Now I want you to check out this next
                  hombre.  I found him stoned in the
                  jungle and there's nothing you'll
                  ever see like him.  I present with
                  great pride, 'from Caracas, Venezuela
                  -- 'Octavia' !

      Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
      sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
      light drawing immediate laughter.
      He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
      mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
      With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the
      sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established,
      the music suddenly shifts upbeat to "Saturday Night Fever"
      and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts
      shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes
      staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
      Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
      More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
      PJ%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
      face of a young clown in white paint with the large
      blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
      audience.
      Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
      The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
      pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
      bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing,
      everybody is merry...

            sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
            its close, a haunting figure of mockery....
            Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time.     His
            antennae warn him.     Out of the side of his eye, he sees....
            The two hitters moving on him.
            He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
            smashing the mirrors....
            Screams,    crowd diving for cover....
            Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Baretta out of
            his ankle, firing....
            Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers
            across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and
            ceilings....
            Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing....
            The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
            mirrors, and more screaming.
            Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
            door, his clothes ripped with blood and'glass.
            The clown, Octavia,    lies dead on the silent dance floor.
 CUT TO 114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114             Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.
            Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking
            lot, he runs out of ammunition.
            He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.
             The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club,
             towards him.
             The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.
             Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram
             machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.
             Carhops    scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
             Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head
             exploding like squashed watermelon.

114 CONTINUED 114       Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
      across the shattered windows.
      He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
      the armor plating, whining against the shutters.
      Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
      gear shift into reverse.
      In an instant, his warmobile                        in reverse,
                                           accelerates
      climbing to top speed....

      there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

 CUT TO INT. SAFE 115 HOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115       Tow, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
      reveals to Us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at

              Tony,
              shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein
              sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred
              and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.
 TONY                           Hitters.   Somebody musta brought 'em

 LOPEZ                           Anyway I'm glad you made it Tony,

            Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
            forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.

               He produces his Baretta from his sling and holds it in his
               left hand pointed at the big man.

                Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up

       security gates, acres of lawns and a guarded boat dock on a
       canal.  Tony has erected his fortress-like Shangri-La, to
       which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
       sign on the front lawn that says:
 THE WORLD IS YOURS 
 MONTANA TRAVEL CO. 
       Just    like       it     should        be.

       the Monsignor; the triumphant montage music rising to its
       full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
       girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is
       with a girl who looks like an animal, with an extremely

       stretches majestically under a solitary banyan tree, extend-
       ing a giant claw and licking himself.

 CUT TO 151-B INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - MONTH DATER 151-B 
             Tony,  accompanied by Marmy, walks a young, thirtyish bank
             president into his office, which is rigged with video
             monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.
             There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound
             systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs --
             but not one sign of a book on the walls.
             Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the
             eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who
             follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who
             never stops thinking money.

 TONY                          ...yeah, well, I can't pay that no
                         more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in

                         talking ten million a month now.
                         That's serious money.   So I think
                         it's time you bank boys come down

        he has another engagement,

159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY       Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
      glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
      taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
      As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
      suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
 "CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC. 
160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 16       The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
      There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
      moving, talking.
      Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
      from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
      Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
      chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
      passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
      which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
      Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
      rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.
      The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and

 GOODSON                     How        do    you   do,    Mr. Montana....
      He smells like a government guy.  Sosa summons                             the     black
      aide -- in a hushed voice.
 SOSA                 Nicky, have Albert0 meet us in the
                living  room.
      The   black       aide    goes.
 SOSA                                      (solicitous)
                       Tony,        come, please sit          here.

      Tony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,
      surrounded on            all sides. There is a strained beat to the
      proceedings.             Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.
      He suddenly catches a glimpse                      of the sloe-eyed Gabriella
      moving with another woman past                     a window of the house. Then
      she's gone.
      Sosa pulls         up     a     chair   right     opposite      Tony,   almost    touching
      knees.
 SOSA                        Tony, I want to discuss something
                       that concerns all of us here....

 SQSA                         Tony, you have a problem; we have a
                        problem... I think we can solve both
                        our problems.
           Tony     waits.

 SOSA                          We all know you have tax troubles in
                         your country -- and you may have to
                         do a little time. But we have some
                         friends in Washington who tell us
                         these troubles can be taken care of
                            ...maybe you'll have to pay a big
                         fine and some back interest, but
                         there's no      time....

           Pause.  Tony looks.         The American guy, Goodson, shifts his
           gaze away.
 TONY                                 your problem, Alex?
                         And
           Sosa looks around, stands up.

 SOSA                          Come I I'll show you.
           Tony cautiously stands to follow him.

 INTERVIEWER                   I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez,
                  about the financial support your govern-
                  ment receives from the drug industry in
                  Bolivia.

 GUTIERFSZ                   The irony, of course, is that this
                  money -- which is in the billions,
                  J i m - - is coming from your country.
                  You are the major purchaser of our
                  national product -- which of course
                  is cocaine.

 INTERVIEWER                   So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez
                  is the United States Government is
                  spending millions of dollars to
                  eliminate the flow of drugs into our
                  streets and at the same time is
 - - -                   doing business with the very same
                  government that floods those' streets
                  with cocaine.. -that's a bit like
                  robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

 ELVIRA                                              (unheard)
                                  What     guy?

                                         (to Tony)
                                  I don't like it.
 TONY                                   You don't like it!   It was you got
                                  me into this mess in the first place
                                  with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!

                                  What's        Seidelbaum     got     to    do     with    this?
                     Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the
                     table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to
                     Elvira's untouched plate.
 TONY                                   Why don't you eat your                    food,     what's
                                  wrong with it?

          She quickly does one               nostril    with    a      quick,     practiced       move-
          ment of her hand.
 TONY                      So    what'd       you     order it       for?

 ELVIRA                      I     lost    my    appetite.
          She   does the other nostril. Tony looking                         at    her.     One     beat.
          Two   beats. He passes a silent burp.


                             (trying to
                             shift the mood)
                     So what about the trial?  I heard
                     Sheffield thinks he can get a new
                     postponement....
          Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues                         to     look    at     Elvira,
          then away, encompassing the restaurant.

 TONY                             (ignoring the question)
                     Is this it? Is that what it's all about,
                     Manny?  Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking?
                     Then what? You're fifty and you got a bag
                     for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and
                     your liver's got spots and you're looking
                     like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
                     Is that what it's all about?


                      It's    not       so    bad    Tony,     could    be      worse....

 TONY                                 (doesn't hear)
                      . . I is that what I worked 'for? With
                      these hands?      Is that what I killed
                      for?     For this?
                                (turns his gaze
                                stonily on Elvira)
                      A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for
                      a wife? Who never eats nothing, who
                      wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps
                      all day with black shades on, who won't
                      fuck me 'cause she's in a coma!


                                   (gently)

      Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill.  She gets up and dumps
      her plate filled with food on him.  Slop drips all over him.

 ELVIRA                      You     sonufabitch!      You fuck!
      They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
      around to clean up the mess.  Tony slowly wiping the food
      off   himself.

 ELVIRA                      How dare you talk to me like that!
                     You call yourself a man! What makes
                     you so much better than me, what do
                     you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
                     Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a
                     real contribution to human history.
                     You want a kid. What kind of father
                     do you think you'd make, Tony? What
                     kind of stories are you going to
                     tell the kid before he goes to sleep
                     at night? You going to drive him to
                     school in the mornings, Tony? You
                     really think you're still going to
                     be alive by the time he goes to
                      school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony,
                     you're dreaming!
      The       audience    is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
      the      faces of     Vie and his rich friends.

       Tony     acidly      quiet, looks     around   at   the   people,   back   to   her.

 TONY                       Sit    down   before   I kill    you.

 ELVXRA                       * . . You think of yourself as a husband,
                      too, Tony.     But did you ever stay
                      home without having six of your goons
                      around all the time? I have Nick the
                      Pig as a friend? What kind of life
                      is that Tony? What kind of life is

           Silence.  Tony's fury has passed.  So has Elvira's.  There's
           this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot
           their lines.

 TONY                               (softly)
                       Go on, get a cab home,                you're    stoned.

            Pause.    She starts wobbling out. Past the silent
            spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony.

            Manny   rises     to     follow.

      food, the silence cathedral.   He stands, wiping at the food
      and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
      then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

 TONY                       You're all assholes. You know why?
                      'Cause none of you got the guts to be
                      what you want to be.
      He wobbles        against   the   table.    Manny   tries     to    help.    Tony
      shakes him        loose.

 TONY                       You need people like me so you can
                      point your fingers and say 'hey
                      there's the bad guy!'   So what does
                      that make you? Good guys? Don't

                      truth -- even when I lie.
      He     starts     out,   staggers.

 TONY                       So say good night to the bad guy...
                      You're never gonna see a bad guy
                      like me again.

      He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
      is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
      its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
      and delight.

 CUT TO 174   EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT                                                f-74
      A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
      stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
      moves into frame.
      Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
      parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
      under the car.

      Tony     looks:

              Tony,    feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
              snort,    paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
              under.
              Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
              the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
              camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
              taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
              the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass
              button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as
              the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
              axle of the car.

                sees     it.

                A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
                towards us,
                Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape
                trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
                Tony     hurries     to     the    car,    bends   down.

                The      Shadow     douses    it     and    freezes     in     position.

                Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
                passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to
 .                 her partner who eases the car to a halt.

                Tony      hurries     out     into    the     street,        taking     the     initiative.

              two shots point-blank into him, blowing his face off and
              smashing him against the door of the moving sedan, blood
              and brains splattering the windows and the seat covers.

       Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried
       shooting.   Ernie follows.

 CHI-CHI                                   come    on.    We gotta       get    out   of
                     Tony,

                     Come     on     baby...Gina!

        Suddenly    she     goes      berserk.

 GINA                      Noooooooooooo!
        And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony,
        screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill
        him.   She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches
        furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious,
        numbed.

        Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands.  They manage
      . at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to
        scream.

               Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
               the pavement into the Corniche.  She continues to scream.

               The     eyes     of      Manolo       staring        sightlessly.

               Chi-Chi       runs      back,        grabs     Tony.

 CHI-MI                                 Tony!

               Pulls     him.        Tony     snaps     out    of     it.

 TONY                                 Yeah!

               He    goes.      Chi-Chi        lifting         Nanny's       body,    hauling      it.

              A     monsoon-like         wind     blows     through       the      trees     on     the    estate.

              The     monkeys      listen        quietly.
              The     f    lamingoes       flutter.
              . . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo
              speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something
              smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they
              go...

                                 see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace
              . . . and we
              doors and          stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his
              estate.
              ...On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
              balustrade.   He's done so much coke now he's practically
               catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

      In far b-g. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors

      out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He

      A    third   monitor.    carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving
      through the trees on the estate.
      On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
      incoherent.
 TONY                     ...I said to you, Manny, I said I
                    never go crazy and you said, I would

      As  Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors
      into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a
      hook flying up and catching the balustrade.                     A shadow

               She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand.

               The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his
               catatonia   as he goes reeling across the floor behind his
               desk.    She fires again.  Again.

               Bullets ripping into the desk.   She advances, offering
               her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic
               intervals.

               He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
               distance between them.  She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
               expression like a demented angel.

               squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling

      A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
      hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
      He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

      Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
      room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

      Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant
      swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
      The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and
      Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
      him over the balustrade.

      The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
      at the base of the balcony.
      Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
      empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the

                   Tony,         they're    everywhere!
                   here!
      Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of                    (X
      silencer bullets.
      We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
      moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
      underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

      Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
      into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
      It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
      looking questioningly in her face.

 TONY                                    (gently)
                       Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at
                       me?      I didn't mean to kill Manny, I
                       was..    .I   was.


      Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her,
      gently lifting her eyelids.  Blood's running out of her
      mouth in rivers.

                Come on open your eyes my baby,
                open your eyes.. -give me a smile.
      There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door     (X:
      of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over
      at the monitors.
      One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
      pounding it.
 CHI-CHI                 Boss !    Hey boss.     Open up!
      On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
      down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
      goes off, blows him up against the door.
 TONY                 Cheeee!
      He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
      sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket
      launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks
      up at the monitor.
      On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
      foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
      Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
      the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a
      grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.
      Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch,
      talking to himself.
 TONY                  So you wanna play hunh, say hello                    (XI
                 to my little friend here.

      The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian
                                             It sounds like
      punks off the landing into the foyer.
      Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing
      wildly.
      Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
      of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

Laughing like a madman. TONY You need an army you hear! An army to kill me! Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards _ Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun. TONY Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces !!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!! Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger The and blows Tony's spine out his belly. Tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior swimming pool below. He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters. As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety. The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says: "THE WORLD IS YOURS" And so, for the brief moment, it was.

          Snowy suburbs of Toronto. From a nondescript house we hear:

          KIM PINE (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?

          SCOTT PILGRIM, 22, fresh faced and charmingly cocky with an
          unruly yet adorable mop of hair.

                         SCOTT
          We have done many things. We ride
          the bus. We have meaningful
          conversations about how yearbook
          club went and about her friends
          and, um...you know...drama.

                         STEPHEN STILLS

          Wicked! How'd you meet her?

                         SCOTT
          I believe I mentioned the bus?
          Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:

          3 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 3

          KNIVES CHAU, 17, cute and innocent with clothes to match,
          sits next to her mother, MOTHER CHAU, 45, demanding.

          get interested in boy!

          Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.

                         MOTHER CHAU
          You drop book.
          Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling.

          SCOTT (O.S.)
          Hey...
          Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM
          holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:

          "SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME."
          Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott
          winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera.

          So when do we get to meet her?

          An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack.

          You promise to be good?

                         KNIVES CHAU

          No, really. Please be good.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Am I normally not?
          Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.

                         SCOTT
          Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen
          Stills. He's the talent.

          STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.

          Is she gonna geek out on us?

          You? Hurt?
          Scott takes a breath, turns to Young Neil.

                         SCOTT
          Neil, you were saying she seems awesome.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Yeah, she seems awesome.

          9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9

          Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He
          turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal.

          "WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"

                         SCOTT
          Before you hear some dirty lies
          from someone else, yes, I'm dating
          a 17 year old.
          Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.

                         WALLACE
          Is he cute?

                         SCOTT
          Ha, ha, ha, ha.

                         WALLACE
          Does this mean we have to stop
          sleeping together?

                         SCOTT
          Do you see another bed in here?
          TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the
          one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included.

                         WALLACE
          Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.

                         SCOTT
          So. The whole seventeen year old
          thing. Don't tell too many people.

          You know me.
          Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting.

                         SCOTT
          Who are you texting?
          RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.

          STACEY (O.S.)
          Seventeen years old? Scandal!
          Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on
          her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'If
          you are using your cellphone, you will not be served'.

          "STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN."

                         SCOTT
          That's not true. Who told you?

                         STACEY
          Wallace. Duh.

                         SCOTT
          That gossipy bitch.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          You know me.
          Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless.

                         SCOTT
          Wallace!
          Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.

                         STACEY
          Who is this mysterious child you date?

                         SCOTT
          Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.

                         STACEY
          A seventeen year old Chinese
          schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

                         SCOTT
          It's a Catholic school too.

                         STACEY

          Oh my God, you haven't-

                         SCOTT
          No no no. We haven't even held
          hands. I think she hugged me once.

                         STACEY
          Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?

                         SCOTT
          I don't know...it's just nice, you
          know? It's just...simple.

                         STACEY
          It's been over a year since you got
          dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named.
          Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine,
          looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.

          STACEY (CONT'D)
          So, are you legitimately moving on,
          or is this just you being insane?
          Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next
          to a hot redhead in happier times.

                         SCOTT
          Can I get back to you on that?
          A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...

          10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10

          Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
          Uniformed boys and girls pour out.

                         WALLACE
          I do not want to be here. At all.

                         SCOTT
          This school has boys too.

                         WALLACE
          I hate you. Even I would think twice
          about dating a seventeen year old.

                         SCOTT
          Well, she's only allowed out when
          the sun is up, so I wouldn't call
          it dating, more like...

          Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.

                         SCOTT
          Hey Knives, this is my cool gay
          roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.

          Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in
          my class is gay?

          Yes. Does he wear glasses?

          You're too good for him. Run.

          11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11

          Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial
          arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION).
          They punch and kick in unison, side by side.

                         SCOTT
          Did you know the original name of Pac-
          man was Puck-man? You would think it's
          because Pac-Man looks like a yellow
          hockey puck, but actually it comes
          from the Japanese phrase paku-paku
          which means to flap ones mouth open
          and closed. They changed it over here
          because Puck-Man is too easy to
          vandalize. You know, scratch out the P
          and turn it into an F or whatever?
          Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.

          Ohmigod, like...wow.

          Tamara is into this Korean guy,
          Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby

          What is it, Scott?

                         SCOTT
          I had this totally weird dream.

                         OTHER VOICE
          Oh God.

                         WALLACE
          What is it, Scott?
          A scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace:

          "OTHER SCOTT, 22, WALLACE'S BOYFRIEND? FUN FACT: GUY CURIOUS"

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me
          not interested.

                         SCOTT
          But there was this girl...

                         WALLACE
          Girl?

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Was this an Envy related dream?

                         WALLACE
          We don't use the E-word in this house.

                         SCOTT
          No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new...

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Yay for that.
          Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes.

          Speaking of new, weren't you
          supposed to take your fake high
          school girlfriend to the library a

          Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room.

          Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library.
          He carries a stack of books for Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Libraries remind me of grade school.

          That must seem like a reeeeally
          long time ago.

                         SCOTT
          Uh. Let's talk about something else.
          The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He
          freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM
          skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Do you know that girl?
          The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to
          the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades
          out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.

          Scott?
          Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl.

          Well you know Pac-Man was

          Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck

          I don't want you scaring off the
          coolest girl at my party Scott. We

          wannabe jerky jerk.

                         SCOTT
          That's garbage! Completely untrue.

          Hey, me and Kim are all good now.
          SCOTT looks to KIM. We hear the sound of arctic winds.

          keeps mentioning some guy named

          Scott lies on the futon, WIDE awake. Wallace storms in.

                         WALLACE
          Guess who's druuunk?

                         SCOTT
          I guess Wallace.

                         WALLACE
          You guess right.
          Wallace flops onto the futon, landing next to Scott.

                         SCOTT
          So, that girl. From my dream.

                         WALLACE

          Scott LEAPS out of the futon and RUNS towards the front door,
          THROWING IT OPEN and startling Ramona Flowers just as she
          presses the doorbell. DINGY DONG...

                         SCOTT
          Hi, um, I was thinking about asking
          you out, but then I realized how
          stupid that would be.

                         (BEAT)
          Do you want to go out sometime?

                         RAMONA
          Um, no, that's okay. You just have
          to sign for this alright?

                         SCOTT
          I just woke up, and you were in my
          dream. I dreamt you were delivering
          me this package. Is that weird?

                         RAMONA
          It's not weird at all.

                         SCOTT
          It's not?

                         RAMONA
          No, it's just like, you've got this
          really convenient subspace highway
          running through your head that I
          like to use. It's like three miles
          in fifteen seconds.

                         SCOTT
          Right...

          Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't
          have that in Canada.

                         SCOTT
          You don't remember me do you? I met
          you at the party the other day.

                         RAMONA
          Were you the Pac-Man guy?

                         SCOTT
          No. Not even. That was some total
          ass. I was the other guy. You're
          Ramona Flowers right?

                         RAMONA
          That's me.

                         SCOTT
          So, you're like American?

                         RAMONA
          Why, am I coming off as rude?

                         SCOTT
          Not at all. Noooooo...
          Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen.

                         RAMONA
          You know...you need to sign for
          this. Whatever this is?

                         SCOTT
          It's something really cool. You'd
          be impressed.

                         RAMONA
          You still have to sign.

                         SCOTT
          But if I sign for it, you'll leave.

                         RAMONA
          Yeah. That's how it works.

                         SCOTT
          Okay well, can we just maybe just
          hang out sometime? Get to know each
          other? You're the new kid on the
          block, right? I've lived here
          forever. I mean...there are reasons
          for you to hang out with me?

          I need to find a new route.

          Either that or you need to start
          hanging out with me.

                         RAMONA
          You want me to hang out with you?

                         SCOTT
          Um...you know...if that's cool.

                         RAMONA
          If I say yes, will you sign for
          your damn package?
          Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the
          package straight in the trash.

                         SCOTT
          Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock?

          Scott finds Ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the
          park. The Toronto skyline gleams in the night behind them.

                         SCOTT
          Why are you just standing there?

                         RAMONA
          Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

                         SCOTT
          Sorry, I just assumed you were too
          cool to be on time.

                         RAMONA
          Well. You assumed wrong.

          So what do you want to do? We could

          This is good.
          Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.

                         SCOTT
          This is good. So how'd you end up in
          Toronto?

                         RAMONA
          Just needed to escape I guess.

          Oh yeah?

                         RAMONA
          I got this job here. And Gideon had

          Is that why you left New York?

          Pretty much. It was time to head

          I just haven't been obsessed with a
          girl for a long time. It's weird.

                         RAMONA
          That's probably because you sleep

          It's not like I'm gonna send you
          home in a snowstorm or anything.
          You can sleep in my bed. And I

          This is cool, just this. It's been
          like a really long time, and this
          is...I think I needed this.
          Whatever this is. So, thanks.

                         RAMONA
          You're welcome.
          They exchange a smile. Then without warning we jump cut to -

          36 INT. RAMONA'S ROOM - MORNING 36

          DAYLIGHT! Scott awakens. Ramona is gone. An arrow points to
          the empty spot in the bed next to him.

          'NO RAMONA'
          Another arrow point out that-

          'SHE'S IN THE SHOWER'
          Ramona steps out of the bathroom in a towel. Scott relaxes.

                         RAMONA
          I have to work.

                         SCOTT
          Work?

                         RAMONA
          You have to leave.

          37 EXT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 37

          Ramona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to
          her. WAIST DEEP SNOW covers the roads and sidewalks.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, can this not be a one night
          stand? For one thing, I didn't even
          get any...that was a joke.

                         RAMONA
          What did you have in mind?

                         SCOTT
          Umm...oh, come to the first round
          of this battle of the bands thing.

          Wait! Can I get your number?
          SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott.
          She hands him a note. 'RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'

                         SCOTT
          Wow, girl number.
          Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away.

                         RAMONA
          See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.

                         SCOTT

          'THE ROCKIT, FUN FACT: THIS PLACE IS A TOILET'.
          Ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young
          hipsters, reaching Scott at the bar. He stands with Wallace
          and Stacey. She holds hands with a guy wearing glasses.

                         SCOTT
          You totally came!

                         RAMONA
          Yes. I did totally come.
          Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish.

                         STACEY
          Excuse my brother. He's chronically
          enfeebled. I'm Stacey.

                         RAMONA
          Hey.

                         STACEY
          And this is Wallace, his room-mate.

          Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in.

                         SCOTT

          HEYYYYYYYY!

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Hey.
          Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives
          looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Do you like?

          LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives
          and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Have. To. Go.
          Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage.

          PROMOTER (O.S)
          This next band are from Brampton
          and they are Crash And The Boys.

          39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39

          Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping
          through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          This is a nightmare. Is this a
          nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up.

                         KIM
          Once we're on stage you'll be fine.

                         STILLS
          We were just on stage. For sound
          check. The sound guy hated us.

                         SCOTT
          It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters.
          People love us. Right?
          Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and
          Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.

          Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?

                         JIMMY
          They...haven't started playing yet.

                         WALLACE
          That was a test, Jimmy. You passed.

                         CRASH
          Good evening. I am Crash, and these

          MATTHEW PATEL lands onstage and glares at Scott through a
          lopsided fringe. He wears an evil grin and a jacket that
          borders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out).

          Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and
          sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking
          hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.

                         MATTHEW PATEL

          counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott
          jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy.

                         WALLACE
          What's up with his outfit?

                         OTHER HECKLER
          Yeah! Is he a pirate?
          Scott looks at Patel's outfit.

                         SCOTT
          Are you a pirate?

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Pirates are in this year!
          Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel
          puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          You really went out with this guy?

                         RAMONA
          Yeah, in the seventh grade.
          The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the
          balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK.

                         RAMONA (CONT'D)
          It was football season and for some
          reason, all the little jocks wanted
          me. Matthew was the only non-white,
          non-jock boy in school, probably in
          the entire state, so we joined
          forces and took 'em all out. We
          were one hell of a team. Nothing
          could beat Matthew's mystical
          powers. Nothing but pre-teen
          capriciousness. We only kissed
          once. After a week and a half, I
          told him to hit the showers.

          Dude, wait...mystical powers?
          Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          You'll pay for this, Flowers!
          Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          If you want to fight me, you're not
          the brightest. You won't know
          what's hit you in the slightest.
          Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with
          fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Me and my fireballs and my Demon
          Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the
          talk because I know I'm slick.
          Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott.
          He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Fireball Girls! Take this sucker
          down.
          The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott
          dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him.

          MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
          Let us show him what we're all
          about.
          Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs.
          They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings.

                         SCOTT
          That doesn't even rhyme.
          Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and
          throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the
          eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          This is impossible, how can it be?!
          Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time
          to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face.

                         SCOTT
          Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.

          Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara.

          Scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them.

                         SCOTT
          Aw man. $2.40? That's not even
          enough for the bus home.

                         RAMONA
          I'll lend you the 30 cents.
          Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage.

          If we're going to date, you may
          have to defeat my seven evil ex's.

          Well, someone got to second base

          second date tonight.

          Someone's lucky then.

          You know when I say 'someone', I mean

          I don't want you gaying up the place.

                         WALLACE
          Okay, Scott. But in return I have
          to issue an ultimatum.

                         SCOTT
          One of your famous ultimatums?

                         WALLACE
          It may live in infamy...You have to
          break up with Knives. Today. Okay?
          Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.

                         SCOTT
          But...but...it's HARD.

                         WALLACE
          If you don't do it, I'm going to

          Scott walks out, leaving Knives in the aisle.

          56 INT. THE BUS / RECORD STORE - DAY 56

          Scott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Knives.
          CROSSCUT with Knives still in the record store, in shock.
          ON THE BUS: Scott sighs, thinks of something happier...
          CROSSCUT with Ramona: rollerblading, her funky pink hair.
          ON THE BUS: Scott smiles, a little happier.

                         SCOTT
          Oh. No. We broke up.
          Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look.

          OH! Check it out, I learned the
          bass line from Final Fantasy 2.
          Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune.

                         KIM PINE
          Scott, you are the salt of the earth.

                         SCOTT

          GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at
          practice, whether they're old, new
          or new-new. We were lucky to

          Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development.

                         SCOTT
          You know your hair?

                         RAMONA

                         SCOTT
          It's all blue.

          Ramona lounges, reading a magazine. A tense Scott hurries
          around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on.

                         WALLACE
          Are you doing okay there?

          She changed her hair.

          She's spontaneous. Impulsive.
          Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?

          meal. Or just all the time without
          even stopping.

          You'd get fat.

          A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar.

                         SCOTT
          So I wrote a song about you.

          before me and my big ex broke up. But
          it's so long ago, I can barely
          remember it...
          A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.

                         NARRATOR
          Scott is acutely aware that his last
          salon haircut took place exactly 431
          days ago, three hours before his big
          breakup. He blames this largely on the
          haircut and has been cutting his own
          hair ever since.

                         RAMONA
          Sounds like a bad time.

                         SCOTT
          Not really.

                         NARRATOR
          It was.

                         SCOTT
          It was a mutual thing.

          It wasn't.

                         SCOTT
          I mean, she told me it was mutual.

          she stopped liking that name.
          Then...she stopped liking me...

          Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing
          his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.

          just so you could cover your hair

          You seem a little...heightened.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm
          with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not
          that I do drugs, unless you do, in
          which case I do drugs all the time,
          every drug, but...you make me feel...I
          don't know. Things seem a little
          brighter around you or something.
          Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and
          NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.

          Ooh.

          Ooh?
          The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits
          his trailer, smoking a cigarette (blacked out). He skates
          towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go 'oooh'.

                         WALLACE
          I want to have his adopted babies.

                         RAMONA
          Oh, man. We gotta go.

                         SCOTT
          What? Why?

                         RAMONA
          I used to date that clown.

                         WALLACE
          Slut.

                         RAMONA
          Wallace. I am not a slut.

          Lucas steps to his mark and puffs up into action hero mode.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Action.
          Lucas Lee points his board at the GOON.

                         SCOTT
          Oh...my...God...

                         LUCAS LEE
          Hey. The only thing keeping me and
          her apart is the two minutes it's
          gonna take to kick your ass.

                         SCOTT
          ...you dated a FAMOUS guy?!

                         RAMONA
          In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually,
          it might have been math. I just
          remember there being lots of drama.

                         LUCAS LEE

          HEY!!!
          Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.

                         RAMONA
          He just followed me around. He was
          a little snot nosed brat.

                         SCOTT
          He had snot? In his nose? But he's
          famous!

                         LUCAS LEE

          HEY!!!

                         RAMONA
          It's not a big deal. I only dated
          him for a week and a half-

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm talking to you Scott Pilgrim!
          Lucas Lee stomps towards Scott, who gasps.

                         SCOTT
          He's famous and he talked to me!

                         SCOTT
          Can I get your autograph?
          POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Sup. How's life? He seems nice.
          Lucas Lee THROWS Scott up into a castle turret, crumbling it.
          Scotts CRASHES down through scaffolding onto the set. Lucas
          holds up his hands for a quick continuity photo, then stomps
          over to pick up a dazed Scott from the ground.

          A-lister, bro?
          Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down
          ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Some competish you are.
          Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done-
          Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!

          LUCAS LEE (O.S.)
          Looks like you're seeing double.
          Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines.
          POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.

                         LUCAS LEE
          He's good, right? Sometimes I let
          him do wide shots if I feel like
          getting blazed back in my winnie.
          Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS
          STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically
          dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm nothing without my stunt team.
          The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES
          through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.

                         WALLACE
          Ask them how it feels to always get
          his sloppy seconds!

                         SCOTT
          How does it feel to-
          KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a
          barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          I'm gonna get coffee. You homies
          want anything?
          We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear
          the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing.

          Lucas turns, shocked to see Scott, in front of a PAINTED 2-D
          SKYLINE BACKDROP, surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen.

                         SCOTT
          You're needed back on set.
          Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas
          GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP!
          Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline.
          Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.

                         LUCAS LEE
          Prepare... prepare to feel the wrath
          of the League of Evil Exes!

          Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer.
          Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets
          him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw.

                         SCOTT
          You are a pretty good actor.

                         LUCAS LEE

          Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo.

                         SCOTT
          So you can sell them, but can you
          do a thingy on that rail?
          Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.

                         LUCAS LEE
          It's called a grind, bro.

                         SCOTT
          So can you do a grind thingy now?

                         LUCAS LEE
          Are you serious? There's like 200
          steps and the rails are garbage.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, if it's too hardcore...

          Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight,
          sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...
          Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.

          Okay, it's 'love'. I wasn't trying
          to trick you or anything. Look, if
          she's really the girl of your
          dreams, then you have to let her
          know. You have to overcome any and
          all obstacles that lie in your

          It's been a long time.

          Yeah.

          ENVY (O.S.)
          A year I think?

          Approximately.

          ENVY (O.S.)
          How are you?

                         SCOTT
          I'm not doing so good right now.

          ENVY (O.S.)
          That's too bad. Still breaking hearts?

                         SCOTT
          What? No, stop. I've been-it's been
          different. You have no idea.

          ENVY (O.S.)
          Probably not. Do you have a
          girlfriend? Should I be jealous?

                         SCOTT
          Yes, you should. I have this
          totally awesome girlfriend who
          calls me all the time. And she's
          America. Uh. She's American.

          ENVY (O.S.)
          What's her name?

                         SCOTT
          I'm not telling you that. Ramona.

                         WALLACE
          Okay. Everything does suck.
          Scott grunts. RINGY RING. Wallace grins and grabs the phone.

                         WALLACE
          Or does it?
          Scott sits bolt upright, expectant.

          Scott lays back down. FUCK.

          What's that? You're outside?
          Scott sits bolt upright again. FUCK! Wallace opens the door a
          crack. Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking.

          Is Scott here?

          You know what?
          Behind Wallace, we see Scott LEAP through a window head
          first. GLASS SMASHES.

          WALLACE (CONT'D)
          He just left.
          Knives sighs. Scott sprints away in the background.

          lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott.

          I dated a Todd once. That didn't

          She's probably like 25! She's just

          She's got a head start! I didn't

          I think we should get out of here.

                         JULIE
          How was the tour? You played with
          The Pixies? You're a superstar now!

          It's-yeah, it's not something I can

          So...Scott and Ramona eh?

                         RAMONA
          What of it?

          Just saying, cute couple. I like your
          outfit Ramona. Affordable?

                         JULIE
          I was going to say, Envy. Did you
          get those jeans in New York, they're-

          Ramona lived in New York.

                         ENVY
          I was just there. We played the

          Scott jumps to his feet, FACING OFF against Todd Ingram.

                         SCOTT
          Knives!?
          Young Neil rushes to Knives' aid. Scott boils. Todd smirks.

                         TODD INGRAM
          That's right. I'm not afraid to hit
          a girl. I'm a rock star.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          You punched the highlights out of
          her hair!
          ANGLE on Knives. Her hair is black and plain as before.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          He punched the highlights. Out. Of.
          Her. Hair.

                         ENVY
          You're incorrigible.

          I don't know the meaning of the word.
          Young Neil escorts Knives out. Todd sits back down like
          nothing happened. Scott's face is a bright shade of rage.

                         JULIE
          So, are you guys doing anything fun
          while you're in town?

          FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!
          Scott LEAPS across the table and SWINGS a punch at Todd.
          Todd THRUSTS a hand out and telekinetically FREEZES SCOTT IN
          THE AIR. Scott hovers, grasping his neck, choking. Todd's
          hair magically forms into a FAUXHAWK.

                         SCOTT

          Todd telekinetically HURLS Scott through the club's wall!
          Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb peer through the newly made hole in
          the wall, to see Scott sprawled on some trash bags. He tries
          to keep cool, despite being in a lot of pain.

                         SCOTT
          No kidding...anyone can be...vegan.

                         TODD INGRAM
          Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

                         SCOTT
          Ovo what?

                         TODD INGRAM
          I partake not in the meat nor
          breastmilk or ovum of any creature
          that has a face.

                         ENVY
          Short answer: Being vegan just
          makes you better than most people.

                         TODD INGRAM
          Bingo.
          Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into
          the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Hey man, question. I always
          wondered, how does not eating dairy
          products give you psychic powers?

                         TODD INGRAM
          You know how you only use ten
          percent of your brain? Well, it's
          because the other 90% is filled up
          with curds and whey.

                         KIM PINE
          Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

          Go ahead and get snippy baby, if
          you knew the science, maybe I'd
          listen to a word you're saying.
          Scott returns to earth with a THUMP. He moans in pain. While
          the others bicker, Ramona helps Scott to his feet.

          A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          I was only dating Lucas until the
          minute Todd walked by. I guess
          that's not very nice, but I used to
          be kind of...like that.
          Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making
          out with Young Todd.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          We hated everyone. We wrecked
          stuff. Nobody cared.

          He punched a hole in the moon for
          me. It was pretty crazy.
          Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy.

          RAMONA (V.O.)
          A week and a half later, he told me
          his Dad was sending him to the
          Vegan Academy, so I dumped him.
          Does that help you at all?
          The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect.

                         SCOTT
          Have you dumped everyone you've
          ever been with? You've never been
          the dumpee?
          Ramona shrugs.

                         RAMONA
          Look, I've dabbled with being a
          bitch. It's part of the reason I
          moved here. I was really hoping to
          put it all behind me.

          That's right, Pilgrim. I actually

          The Vegan Police BLAST Todd with arcs of power from their

          Uh, sorry I guess.

          A battle worn Scott limps through the hole in the wall.
          Ramona follows, shooting Envy a look on the way out.

          Envy Adams. I hate that bitch so
          much I kind of love her.

                         OTHER SCOTT
          Yeah. That Todd guy was cool too.
          And hot. I liked him.
          Scott sighs and holds a cold Coke Zero on his forehead.

          I'm not sure it's gonna be much of
          a party, I think a third of the

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Cool bands never go to their own
          after parties. It's just the
          desperate people trying to rub
          elbows with label guys.

          We really don't have to go to this

          age. It was a very healthy break
          up. We're all peaches and gravy.
          We hear an offscreen distant 'nooooo' from Knives.

          And what about you and Kim?
          They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.

          It was high school. She had

          foot tall purple suited dude! And I
          had to fight 96 guys to get to him,
          too! He was flying and shooting
          lightning bolts from his eyes! He
          was totally awesome and I kicked
          him so far he saw the curvature of
          the earth! Does that make you feel

          You unbelievable bitch.
          RAMONA pulls a LARGE HAMMER from her purse.

                         RAMONA
          Believe it.
          An embarrassed Scott watches with the rest of the crowd.

                         SCOTT
          Wallace?

                         WALLACE
          Uh huh?

                         SCOTT
          This is happening right?

                         WALLACE
          Uh huh.

                         SCOTT
          I mean, this is live?

                         WALLACE
          Oh yeah. KICK HER IN THE BALLS,

          RAMONA!
          With blinding speed, Roxy slips her belt off and WHIPS A
          RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona
          CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES
          into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere.
          PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It
          smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out.
          Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt
          SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt
          wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window.

                         ROXY
          I'm sending you back to Gideon in a
          thousand pieces, you slag.
          Ramona springs off of various pieces of furniture, LEAPING
          towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and
          SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it.

                         RAMONA
          I'd rather be dead than go back.
          He's a creep, you're a bitch and
          you all deserve each other.

                         ROXY
          Give it a rest, Ramona. This is a
          League game.

           Meaning?
          Roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified Scott.

                         ROXY
          Meaning your precious Scott must
          defeat me with his own fists. Or
          possibly feet.

          I'm not sure I can hit a girl.
          They're soft.

                         RAMONA
          You don't have a choice.
          Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES
          with deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious
          volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces.

                         ROXY
          Fight your own battles, lazy ass!
          PAF! Roxy disappears then REAPPEARS between Scott and Ramona,
          kicking them apart with the splits. Roxy then KICKS Scott
          into the ceiling. He lands HARD on the floor.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          Every Pilgrim reaches the end of his
          journey. Some sooner than others.
          Roxy lifts her leg over her head, preparing to drop her boot
          of DEATH on Scott's head. She grins at Ramona.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          Your B.F's about to get F'd in the B!

                         RAMONA
          Her weak point's the back of her knees!

                         SCOTT
          What? How does that work?

                         RAMONA
          Whenever we were making out, I-

                         SCOTT
          Okay.
          As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and
          lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.

          GRAPHIC: 'TICKLE TICKLE!'

                         ROXY
          Oh...
          Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic
          meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms.

          ROXY (CONT'D)
          You'll...never...be able to do this
          to herrrrrrrrrrr!
          Roxy screams in ecstasy before EXPLODING into COINS. A spent
          Scott is left standing in the middle of the room.

           Scott flushes red and retreats back to the bar. Ramona
           follows tentatively. The gossip echoes around them.

                          RAMONA
           Sooooo...

                          SCOTT
          Two gin and tonics please.

                         RAMONA
          I thought you didn't drink.

                         SCOTT
          Only on special occasions. Why? Did
          you want one?
          Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.

                         RAMONA
          I guess we really don't know that
          much about each other do we?
          Scott seems immediately drunk.

                         SCOTT
          Maybe you could just give me a list
          of all your exes so at least I know
          who's going to beat my ass into the
          ground next.

                         RAMONA
          Oh, like a handy little laminate or
          something? Let me see if I can find one.
          (looks through bag)
          Maybe we could exchange our information.
          Scott has already downed his second drink.

                         SCOTT
          Just out of sheer curiosity and
          concern for my mortal well-being,
          is there anyone at this party you
          haven't slept with?

          EVERY GUY AND GIRL AT THE PARTY

          HEY!
          Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair.

                         RAMONA
          I really think we should split.

                         SCOTT
          As in 'get out of here'? Or as in
          'split split'?

          How could I not? I feel like we just
          washed our sexy laundry in public.

                         RAMONA
          Dirty laundry. You're drunk.

                         SCOTT
          (holds up 2 fingers)
          I've had like one drink.

                         RAMONA
          Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't
          enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm
          sick of it. I thought you might be
          more understanding.

                         SCOTT

                         I JUST-

                         RAMONA
          You're just another evil ex-
          boyfriend waiting to happen.
          Ramona walks off and loudly announces.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          And yes, there is someone at this
          party I haven't slept with. You.
          Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the
          room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party.
          But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST.

          RAMONA (CONT'D)
          P.S. Here's your stupid list.
          Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-

          'PATEL, LEE, INGRAM, RICHTER, KATAYANAGI TWINS, GIDEON...'

                         SCOTT

          identical Asian twins dressed like pretentious New Wave fops.

          It's not an issue. You know bands,
          I know battles. We got it covered.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, we'd understand if you didn't
          want to take part.

          Not only do I want to take part. I

          Your bad is saying my bad.
          Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind

          Come on man! I put aside my
          problems for the music. If I can do

          talk to her before she's gone...

                         SCOTT

                         THANKS KI-

                         KIM PINE
          And I really don't care.
          Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to
          find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then-
          Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage.
          A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear,
          sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands.
          KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN
          KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese.
          Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean,
          we can do this. Right?

                         KIM PINE
          Right.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott?
          Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him.

                         KIM PINE
          Scott!
          Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting
          an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that
          it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the
          ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.

          AUDIENCE DUDE (O.S.)
          They brought the house down.
          Now an open air venue, SNOW falls onto the stage. An earth
          shaking BASS NOTE blows the dust off Sex Bob-Omb...
          Scott and Stills get into battle position. Scott screams!

          Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT, their sound blowing a mass of snow
          towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome.
          Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up
          to the Japanese character for '11'. Their waveforms transform
          the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON!
          Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from
          the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS
          SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers.
          Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Let's break up now and get it over
          with. We screwed the pooch in front
          of Gideon Graves. We're done.

                         SCOTT
          Gideon...is here? Where?
          Stills points to the 'Mystery Geek', who smirks and whispers
          in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.

                         SCOTT
          That's Gideon?
          Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He
          struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as
          Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.

                         SCOTT
          Alright. Let's do this!
          Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in
          heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!
          Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms
          transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI!
          The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their
          Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect
          beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music.
          The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in
          time to the music!
          Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce

          '+999 ROCKING'

                         KIM PINE
          That...was epic.
          The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears,
          hovering next to Scott.
          Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are
          gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott. What are you doing?

                         SCOTT
          Getting a life.
          Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still-
          applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES
          standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I just came to see the show. I'm
          not even stalking you.
          Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.

                         SCOTT
          You seem... different.
          Knives shrugs, different.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I feel like I know stuff now.
          Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of
          GREEN HAIR exiting the building.

                         SCOTT
          Ramona...
          Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.

          Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue.

          A sleek black '61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.

          GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in
          tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          The good news, Scottie, is I'm

          We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is
          furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs
          it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.

          Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band
          with this douche-in-charge.

          keep your emotions in check. Don't
          let what's past screw up your
          future.
          Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the
          mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          The people need to hear us, Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Then you're going to need to find
          someone else to play bass.
          A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.

                         GIDEON
          Looks like we're all set.
          Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all
          round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.

                         GIDEON
          Oh and Scott, we should really be
          thanking each other. I mean, if it
          wasn't for me, you would have never
          been with Ramona, but if it wasn't
          for you, she wouldn't be back with
          me. So I guess it all shakes out.
          Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.

                         GIDEON
          And hey, the whole League of Evil
          Exes thing? I was in a dark place

          You can sleep on the floor until

          Wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask.

          Thanks.
          RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up.

                         SOME GUY
          It's for Scott.

          Hello?

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Hey, pal. Just wanted to say I feel
          terrible about earlier. I don't
          want any hard feelings, so I
          figured why not be the bigger man
          and give you a call.

                         SCOTT
          Is Ramona with you?

          90 INT. GIDEON'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS 90

          Gideon appears to sit on some kind of throne. He calls off.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I don't know. Are you with me?

          RAMONA (O.S.)
          Yeah.

          SCOTT (O.S.)

          Sure you did. Well as you know, I'm
          opening a new Chaos Theatre in
          Toronto and The Sex Bobs are
          playing our grand opening tonight,
          and it would feel really weird for
          all of us if you weren't there.
          They just did a sound check and the
          acoustics in here are amazing.

                         SCOTT

                         (GRIM)
          Yeah. Maybe I'll see you there.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          I hope so, amigo. I don't want
          anymore bad blood between ex's.
          What do you say?

          Mm.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Okay laters.
          Click.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          What a perfect asshole.
          Scott turns, alarmed. REVEAL Wallace on the other cordless.

          Forget what I said earlier. Finish him.

          92 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - NIGHT 92

          Snow blows around a steely eyed Scott as he stomps towards a
          group of desolate WAREHOUSES near the water. A lone HIPSTER
          KID smokes a cigarette, leaning against a warehouse wall.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Password?
          Scott shrugs.

                         SCOTT
          Whatever.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          The Hipster Kid waves Scott in.

          93 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 93

          The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a
          GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Second password?
          Scott gives the slightest shrug.

                         HIPSTER KID
          Cool.
          Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good.

          94 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 94

          Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND
          LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE.
          All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate
          snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck
          Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them.

                         COMEAU
          Yeah, their first album is so much
          better than their first album.
          Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are
          playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on
          bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Scott!
          Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates.

          STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D)
          Let it go. Don't give him the
          satisfaction.

                         SCOTT
          What if I want the satisfaction?

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          Well, then you're doomed.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim!
          Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a
          BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos
          Theatre. Somebody get this man a
          drink! Coke Zero right?
          A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero.
          Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!

                         SCOTT
          I'm not here to drink.

                         GIDEON GRAVES

                         SCOTT
          You mean 'The League'?

                         GIDEON
          Guild, League, whatever. It's
          ancient history.
          Gideon puts his arm around Ramona.

                         SCOTT
          I'll show you how ancient of
          history it is.
          Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          No use crying over spilt Coke,
          buddy. The lady made her choice and
          we're all gonna have to move on.

                         SCOTT
          Well I ain't moving...buddy.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          You want to fight me for her?

                         SCOTT
          Was that not clear?
          (to Sex Bob-Omb)
          Was that not clear?
          Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Now why on earth do you want to do that?

                         SCOTT
          Because, I'm in love with her.
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He
          reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.

          NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Scott earned the power of love...
          Ramona looks away from Scott. Gideon smiles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          I think this deserves a song.

          We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to
          make money, and sell out and stuff.
          Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT.

          A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT.
          Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes
          at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS.
          Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Ramona. My cane.
          Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle.
          He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there.
          Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends
          like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands.
          Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.

                         SCOTT
          Your club sucks, by the way.
          Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.

                         GIDEON
          If my cathedral of cutting edge
          taste holds no interest for your
          tragically Canadian sensibilities,
          then I shall grant you a swift exit
          from the premises. And fast
          entrance into HELLLLLLL.
          Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...

          KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

          SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!!
          KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of
          Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling
          down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          That is priceless.
          Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly
          recovers and POINTS a furious finger.

          put on a show.
          GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's
          tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.

          It's complicated.

                         SCOTT
          Well, maybe now would be the time
          to get into it. Seeing as I'm about
          to die.

                         RAMONA
          Alright... the truth is, it was me
          who was obsessed. I was crazy about
          him. But he ignored me. I was more
          alone when we were together than I
          ever was on my own. That's why I
          had to leave... and that's when he
          started paying attention.

                         SCOTT
          So why go back?

                         RAMONA
          I can't help myself around him,
          Scott. He just... has a way of
          getting into my head.

                         SCOTT
          Well, that's legitimately
          disappointing. I really will leave
          you alone forever now...

                         RAMONA
          No. I mean, he literally has a way
          of getting into my head.
          Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a
          blinking CHIP implanted on her skull.

                         SCOTT
          That is evil.

                         RAMONA
          He's like that.
          Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair.

                         SCOTT
          So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh?

          I'm sorry it had to end this way.
          We had a good run, I guess.

                         SCOTT
          You can't say I didn't try. I
          really fought for you back there.

                         RAMONA
          Uh-huh.
          The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away.

                         RAMONA
          But someone was fighting pretty
          hard for you back there.
          Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,

                         SCOTT
          Knives?

                         RAMONA
          I wish I was ever as fanatically
          devoted to anything as that girl is
          to you.
          Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.

                         SCOTT
          I feel like I learned something. Which
          would be great if I wasn't dead.
          Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.

                         SCOTT
          So...so alone.
          DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Ahhhhhh...
          We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST
          FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We
          hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart.

          SOME GUY (O.S.)
          Again?

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Turn off the light!
          Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK...

                         SCOTT
          Wallace, when my journey began, I
          was living in an ordinary world.
          Ramona skated through my dreams and
          it was like a call to adventure, a
          call I considered refusing. But my
          Mentor, that's you, told me if I
          want something bad enough I have to
          fight for it. So I did. There were
          tests, allies, enemies. I
          approached a deep cave and went
          through a crazy ordeal, during
          which I totally seized the sword.
          Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected!
          Now I realize what I should have
          been fighting for all along. But
          before I do that, I need to ask one
          final favor of you.

          WALLACE (O.S.)
          Sure thing, guy.

                         SCOTT
          Could you put a robe on and hand me
          the phone?
          Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone.

          Hey, pal. I feel terrible about

          Scott Pilgrim RUNS towards the desolate WAREHOUSES. The same
          HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette against the wall.

                         SCOTT
          Your hair looks stupid.
          The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS.

          Scott approaches the two Hipster Kids guarding the ELEVATOR.

          Neil? You have learned well. From

          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos-

                         SCOTT

          You want to fight me for her?
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A strange new power overcomes
          Scott, different than before.

                         SCOTT
          No...I want to fight you for me.
          Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest.

          SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK.
          They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES.

          Scott jumps between them, hands held out.

          SCOTT (CONT'D)

          ENOUGH!
          Knives tries to go around him. Scott GRABS her wrists. She
          kicks him in the face.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and
          I will have my revenge!

          No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated

          You cheated on me Scott?

                         SCOTT
          I cheated on both of you. And I'm
          sorry. I was a different guy back

          And...you're not a fat ass. She didn't

          Wrong move, baby.
          Scott ATTACKS with his sword. Gideon BLOCKS, disarms Scott
          with one move, spins and BUTTS Scott in the face with the
          hilt of the sword. Scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid.
          Knives throws her knives. Gideon's lightning fast sword
          deflects them, SHING SHING!
          Gideon wheels towards Ramona, expecting her to move. She
          looks doubtful, takes a hesitant step towards him. He grins.

          GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Yeah. You're still my girl.
          Ramona steps up to Gideon and whispers in his ear.

          Let's both be girls.
          Ramona knees Gideon in the balls.
          Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her
          scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him.
          Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of

          FREEZE FRAMES.
          Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a
          PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor.
          Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip. He shakes off the
          assault and grins.

                         GIDEON
          You made me swallow me gum. That's
          going to be in my digestive tract
          for seven years!
          Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER
          UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an
          'X' with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD.
          He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely
          dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time
          to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'X'.
          Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down.
          Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and
          scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her.
          SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in
          the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks

          after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.

          Scott lands hard. Gideon lands in front of him and raises his
          sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE,
          cancelling out Gideon's digital sword.
          Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully
          tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom.
          Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon.
          COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott
          punches, sending Gideon back and forth like a pinball: KICK
          PUNCH KICK PUNCH KICK! Gideon's face smashes with each
          impact.
          Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass.
          Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor,
          she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a
          wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning.
          Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his
          glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

          GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Who do you think you are Pilgrim?
          You think you're better than me?
          I'll tell you what you are. A pain
          in my ass. You know how long it
          took to get all the evil exes'
          contact information so I could form
          this stupid league? Like two hours!
          Gideon starts to pixellate quite badly. Not long now...

          GIDEON (CONT'D)
          You're not cool enough for Ramona.
          You're zero. You're nothing. Me?
          I'm what's hip. I'm what's
          happening. I'm blowing up right

          You're right. I'm not cool enough
          for Ramona. And you got another
          thing right. You are blowing up.
          Right now.
          Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face.
          Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of
          the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty-

          POOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
          SHIMMERING COINS rain down. Scott and Knives kiss.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Whoa...

                         KIM PINE
          There goes our deal.

                         STEPHEN STILLS
          We're still getting paid, right?
          Kim points to the falling coins.

                         KIM PINE
          There goes our deal.

                         YOUNG NEIL
          Oh...
          Stills jumps off stage and picks up coins.
          The coin rain continues, silhouetting Scott and Knives in
          their kung fu poses. They share a smile.

          RAMONA (O.S.)
          You two make a good combo.
          Ramona, awake now, makes her way towards them.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah?

                         RAMONA

          The trio walk down the pyramid steps. Scott picks up Gideon's
          fallen glasses.
          The glasses GLIMMER. GIDEON'S VOICE echoes.

          GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
          You can defeat me...but can you
          defeat...yourself?
          Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL
          MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and
          Scott whips around to face...

                         KNIVES CHAU
          Negascott!
          NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed
          hair. Dark clothes. Evil face.
          Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.

                         SCOTT
          No. This is something I have to
          face on my own.
          The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward
          to confront his dark side.
          Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...

          104 EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - EVENING 104

          Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre.
          They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott.
          Then...
          Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake
          hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.

                         KNIVES CHAU
          What happened?

                         SCOTT
          Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit.
          He's a super-nice guy. We actually
          have a lot in common.
          Scott runs his fingers through his hair.

          It's getting really shaggy.
          Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah?

                         KNIVES CHAU
          I like it.
          Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking
          his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.

                         SCOTT
          You do?
          Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
          her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.
          Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Hey... Where are you going?
          Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.

                         RAMONA
          I dunno. I should probably
          disappear.

                         SCOTT
          After all that?

                         RAMONA
          It's hard, you know? I came here to
          get away, but the past keeps
          catching up. I'm tired of people
          getting hurt because of me.
          Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.

                         SCOTT
          I think I understand.
          Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.

                         RAMONA
          I should tahnk you, though.

                         SCOTT
          For what?

                         RAMONA

          That's kind of sad.

                         (ALMOST LAUGHING)
          It is kind of sad.
          She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.

                         RAMONA
          Well... Bye and stuff.

                         SCOTT
          Yeah. And stuff.
          She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-

          KNIVES (O.S.)
          Go get her.
          Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.

                         SCOTT
          Wha?

                         KNIVES
          You earned it. You've been fighting
          for her all along.

                         SCOTT
          But what about you?

                         KNIVES
          (totally sweet and sad)
          I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you
          anyway.
          She grins and kisses his cheek.

                         KNIVES
          There's someone out there for me.
          We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her.
          Guitar still in hand.
          We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame.
          Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-

                         KNIVES
          Go talk to her. Before she's gone.
          Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-

          Hey... mind if I tag along?

          Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.

                         RAMONA
          You want to come with me?

                         SCOTT

                         (HOPEFUL)
          I thought maybe we could... try
          again?
          Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
          earlier. Scott takes it.
          We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
          middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
          Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
          over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
          to spring.
          Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
          'Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
          cell phone airwaves.

          JULIE (V.O.)
          Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
          Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
          with Gideon Graves at the grand
          opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
          was apparently awesome.

          STACEY (V.O.)
          Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
          mean bananas. My little brother
          kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
          It was unbelievable. Someone
          seriously should have been filming
          it.
          Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
          heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.

          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.
          They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
          wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
          tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
          about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.

          GIRL
          Now that the war's over, our
          soldiers get to come home, yes?

          TEACHER
          Some of them. Some will be
          stationed on the rim planets as
          Peace Enforcers.

          BOY
          I don't understand. Why were the
          Independents even fighting us?
          Why wouldn't they look to be more
          civilized?

          TEACHER
          That's a good question. Does
          anybody want to open on that?

          GIRL
          I hear they're cannibals.

          ANOTHER BOY
          That's only Reavers.

          ANOTHER GIRL
          Reavers aren't real.

          ANOTHER BOY
          Full well they are. They attack
          settlers from space, they kill
          them and wear their skins and rape
          them for hours and hours --

          TEACHER
          (in Chinese)
          

          (CALMER)
          It's true that there are...
          dangers on the outer planets. So
          let's follow up on Borodin's
          question. With all the social and
          medical advancements we can bring
          to the Independents, why would
          they fight so hard against us?

          RIVER
          We meddle.

          TEACHER
          River? 
          RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
          and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
          long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
          columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
          a good two years younger than the other kids.

          RIVER
          People don't like to be meddled
          with. We tell them what to do,
          what to think, don't run don't
          walk we're in their homes and in
          their heads and we haven't the
          right. We're meddlesome.

          TEACHER
          (gently taking her

          STYLUS)
          River, we're not telling people
          what to think. We're just trying
          to show them how.
          She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead

          INT. LAB - NIGHT

           And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
          sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
          right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
          technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
          The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.

          2ND TECHNICIAN
          She's dreaming.

          FIRST TECHNICIAN
          Nightmare?

          2ND TECHNICIAN
          Off the charts. Scary monsters.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
          drop.
          DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
          that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
          with himself.

          

          

          

          

          4.
          Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
          making him a little nervous.
          The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
          -- no
          substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
          longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS

          (CONTINUING)
          See, most of our best work is done
          when they're asleep. We can
          monitor and direct their
          subconscious, implant
          suggestions...
          River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
          starts forward, slowly.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS

          (CONTINUING)
          It's a little startling to see,
          but the results are spectacular.
          Especially in this case. River
          Tam is our star pupil.
          The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
          staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
          will very soon learn, is SIMON.

          SIMON
          I've heard that.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          She's a genius. Her mental
          capacity is extraordinary, even

          SIMON
          Tell me about them.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Well, obviously, she's unstable...
          the neural stripping gives them
          heightened cognitive reception,
          but it also destabilizes their own
          reality matrix. It manifests as
          borderline schizophrenia... which
          at this point is the price for
          being truly psychic.

          SIMON
          (moves toward her)
          What use do we have for a psychic
          if she's insane?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I don't have to tell you the
          security potential of someone who
          can read minds. And she has lucid
          periods -- we hope to improve upon
          the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to
          ask if there's some reason for
          this inspection.

          SIMON

          (TURNING)
          Am I making you nervous?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support for the
          project was unanimous. The
          demonstration of her power --

          SIMON
          (turns back to her)
          How is she physically?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
           Like nothing we've seen. All our
          subjects are conditioned for
          combat, but River... she's a
          creature of extraordinary grace.

          400

          SIMON
          Yes. She always did love to dance.
          He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.

          ANGLE: THE BATON
          As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
          flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
          forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
          flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
          Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
          head and swabs her, whispering:

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River. Wake up. Please, it's
          Simon. River. It's your brother.
          Wake up...
          She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
          out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
          beneath.

          River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.

          RIVER
          Simon.
          A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.

          RIVER

          (CONTINUING)
          They know you've come.

          INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUING

          As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
          service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
          into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.

          INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
          of double doors.

          SIMON
          We can't make it to the surface
          from inside.
          Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
          them from the other side of the doors.

          But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
          equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
          herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
          outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
          The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
          the lone orderly. Passing right under River.

           EXT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

          It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
          long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
          inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
          They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
          baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
          fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
          Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
          patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
          blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.

          ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
          the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
          A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
          down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
          comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.

          SIMON
          Get on!
          He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
          right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
          Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
          the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
          in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
          holding one of the cables --

          Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.

          and River on the gurney just before it rises.

          There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
          he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
          The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
          He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
          suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
          wear. He is in:

          INT. INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY

          -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
          records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
          Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
          The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.

          Remarkable children.
          Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
          the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
          Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Excuse me! No one is allowed in
          the records room without my
          express permission.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (over this, quietly)
          Enter the doctor.
          (to Mathias)
          Forgive me. I prefer to see the
          event alone, without bias.
          Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I need to see your clearance.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You're right to insist. I know
          you've had security issues here.
          He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
          at the readout, and drops the bluster.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Apologies. An Operative of the
          Parliament will of course have
          full cooperation.
          (looks at screen)
          I'm not sure what... I see no
          listing of rank, or name.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I have neither. Like this
          facility, I don't exist. The
          Parliament calls me in when...
          when they wish they didn't have
          to. Let's talk about the Tams.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I assume you've scanned the status
          logs...

          River was your greatest success.
          A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until
          her brother walked in eight months
          ago and took her from you.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          It's not quite so simple.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm very aware of that.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          He came in with full creds. He
          beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
          There was no way I could --

          THE OPERATIVE
          No, no. Of course. The boy spent
          his fortune developing the
          contacts to infiltrate this place.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Gave up a brilliant future in.
          medicine as well, you've probably
          read. Turned his back on his
          whole life. Madness.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Madness, no. Something a good
          deal more dangerous. Have you
          looked at this scan carefully? At
          his face?
          Mathias looks uncertain.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          It's love, in point of fact. He
          loved his sister and he knew she
          was in pain. So he took her
          somewhere safe.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Why are you here?

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm here because the situation is
          even less simple than you think.

          It's pride.
          He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
          to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.

          Key members of Parliament. Key.
          The minds behind every diplomatic,
          military and covert operation in

          room with a psychic.

          She was... she read cards, nothing
          more.

          THE OPERATIVE
          It's come to our attention that
          River became much more unstable,
          more... disturbed, after you
          showed her off to Parliament. Did
          she see something very terrible in
          those cards?

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          Whatever... secrets she might have
          accidentally gleaned... it's
          probable she doesn't even know she
          knows them. That they're buried
          beneath --

          THE OPERATIVE
          But they are in her. Her mind is
          unquiet. It's the will of the
          Parliament that I kill her. And
          the brother. Because of your sin.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (continuing; moving
          to his briefcase)
          You know, in certain older
          civilized cultures, when men
          failed as entirely as you have,
          they would throw themselves on
          their swords.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          (fed up)
          Well, unfortunately I forgot to
          bring a sword to --
          The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.

          THE OPERATIVE
          The Parliament has no further
          interest in psychics. They
          represent a threat to the harmony
          and stability of our Alliance.

          DOCTOR MATHIAS
          I would put that down right now if
          I were you.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Would you be killed in your sleep,
          like an ailing pet? Whatever your
          failings, I believe you deserve
          better than that.
          The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
          with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
          his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
          reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
          The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
          quietly as the first.
          Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
          bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
          Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
          The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
          for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
          holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
          tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
          as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
          The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.

          triggers. We'll have to reach out
          to River Tam, and help her to come
          back to us. No matter how far out
          Simon has taken her, we can --
          He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
          slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
          Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          This is a good death. There's no

          A man who's done fine works.
          We're making a better world. All
          of them, better worlds.
          Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
          body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:

          THE OPERATIVE

          We move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
          the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
          craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
          on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
          shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
          the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
          As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
          starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
          around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
          the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
          At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
          flying past the window.

          in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
          The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
          tangle of wires and machinery all about.
          Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
          Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
          he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at
          least, weathered. Right now, though, he's mostly startled.

          What was that?
          He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian
          shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old

          I'm doing it! It's not enough.
          (hits com)
          Kaylee!

          MAL
          Just get us on the ground!

          WASH
          That part'll happen, pretty
          definitely.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING

          The camera leads Mal down. On either side of the hall are
          ladders leading down to crew's personal quarters.
          The hulking mercenary JAYNE is coming up out of his bunk as
          Mal passes. He carries a number of rifles and grenades.

          JAYNE
          we're gonna explode? I don't
          wanna explode.

          MAL
          Jayne, how many weapons you plan
          on bringing? You only got the two
          arms...

          JAYNE
          I just get excitable as to choice,
          like to have my options open.

          MAL
          I don't plan on any shooting
          taking place during this job.

          JAYNE
          Well, what you plan and what takes
          place ain't ever exactly been
          similar.

          MAL
          No grenades.
          (Jayne groans)
          No grenades.
          First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of
          dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's.

          ZOE
          Are we crashing again?

          MAL
          Talk to your husband. Is the mule
          prepped?

          ZOE
          Good to go, sir. Just loading her
          up.
          (to Jayne)
          Are those grenades?

          JAYNE
          Cap'n doesn't want 'em.

          J

          

          

          

          

          16.

          ZOE
          We're robbing the place. We're
          not occupying it.
          All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the:

          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING

          It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There
          is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from
          a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
          sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor.

          MAL
          (calling out)
          Kaylee!
          He enters:

          INT. AFT HALL/ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING


          MAL
          (still calling)
          Kaylee, what in the sphincter of
          hell are you playing at?
          The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine
          room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks
          and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes
          Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the
          doorway, raising his voice above the din.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          We got the Primary Buffer

          KAYLEE
          Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to
          fret.

          MAL
          You told me --

          (JOLT)
          You told me the entry couplings
          would hold for another week!

          KAYLEE

          (WORKING)
          That was six months ago, cap'n.

          MAL
          My ship don't crash. If she
          crashes, you crashed her.

          

          

          

          

          17.
          Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up.
          He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned
          than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in
          dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Doctor. Guess I need to get
          innocked 'fore we hit planetside.
          Simon nods, the ship jolting again.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to
          worry about.

          SIMON
          I'm not worried.

          MAL
          Fear is nothing to be ashamed of,
          Doc.

          SIMON
          This isn't fear. This is anger.

          MAL

          4 (LAUGHS)
          Well, it's kinda hard to tell the
          one from t'other, face like yours.

          SIMON
          I imagine if it were fear, my eyes
          would be wider.

          MAL
          I'll look for that next time.

          SIMON
          You're not taking her.

          MAL
          (brushing past him)
          No no, that's not a thing I'm
          interested in talking over with --

          SIMON
          She's not going with you. That's
          final.

          4

          

          

          

          

          18.

          MAL
          (turning back)
          I hear the words "that's final"
          come out of your mouth ever again,
          they truly will be.
          (turning away again)
          This is my boat. Y'all are guests
          on it.
          He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to:

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING

          Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs.

          SIMON
          Guests? I earn my passage,
          Captain --

          MAL
          And it's time your little sister
          learned from your fine example.

          SIMON
          I've earned my passage treating
          bullet holes, knife wounds, laser
          burns...

          MAL
          Some of our jobs are trickier than
          others --

          SIMON
          And you want to put my sister in
          the middle of that.

          MAL
          Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'.
          It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine.
          The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the
          ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:

          INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUING

          Into which the two men step.

          SIMON
          She's a seventeen year old girl.
          A mentally traumatized sevente--

          J

          

          

          

          

          19.

          MAL
          She's a reader. Sees into the
          truth of things; might see trouble
          before it's coming. Which is of
          use to me.

          SIMON
          And that's your guiding star,
          isn't it? What's of use.

          MAL

          (LAUGHS)
          Honestly, doctor, I think we may
          really crash this time anyway.
          Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm.

          SIMON
          Do you understand what I've gone
          through to keep River away from
          the Alliance?

          MAL
          I do, and it's a fact me and mine
          have been courteous enough to keep
          to our own selves.

          SIMON
          Are you threatening to --

          MAL
          I got one purpose here: keep this
          boat in the air. I take the jobs
          I get -- which is less and less,
          case you ain't been keeping track.
          He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Every year since the war the
          Alliance pushes just a little
          further out towards the rim.
          Makes it a chore for naughty men
          like us to slip about -- and
          keeping you two on board means
          working twice as hard to avoid the
          law. Means turning down a score
          of honest jobs.

          J

          

          

          

          

          20.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at
          the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
          ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to
          the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity.

          MAL
          So here is us, on the raggedy
          edge. Don't push me and I won't
          push you. 
          Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Things get gritty I will keep her
          from the fray, but she's coming.
          Best you get her ready.
          As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man
          hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and
          Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this
          boat out before we get flattened?

          ZOE
          Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody
          flies like my mister.
          The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
          the catwalk, and track with them to find:

          SIMON
          River...
          She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
          summer dress draped over her small frame.

          RIVER
          I know. We're going for a ride.

          EXT. LILAC -- DESERT GULCH - DAY

          Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship.
          The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to
          River in the back:

          

          

          

          

          21.

          SIMON
          Now, River, you stay behind the
          others. If there's fighting you
          drop to the floor or run away.
          It's okay to leave them to die.
          River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.

          RIVER
          I'm the brains of the operation.

          ZOE
          We should hit town right during
          Sunday worship. Won't be any
          crowds.

          MAL
          If Fanty and Mingo are right about
          the payroll, this could look to be
          a sunny day for us.

          SIMON

          (APPROACHING)
          Captain, I'll ask you one last
          time...

          MAL
          Doctor, I'm taking your sister
          under my protection here. If
          anything happens to her, anything
          at all, I swear to you I will get
          very choked up. Honestly. There
          could be tears.
          He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...

          KAYLEE
          Don't mind the Captain none,
          Simon. I know he'll look out for
          her.

          SIMON
          It's amazing. I bring River all
          the way out to the raggedy edge of
          the 'verse so she can hide from
          the Alliance by robbing banks.

          KAYLEE
          It's just a little Trading
          Station. They'll be back 'fore
          you can spit.
          (as he stalks off)
          Not that you spit...

          

          

          

          

          22.
          Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn.

          EXT. LILAC - DAY

          We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in.
          The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood
          mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build
          with. Right now the streets are mainly empty.

          EXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak:

          JAYNE
          What are we hoping to find here
          that equals the worth of a turd?

          MAL
          Alliance payroll. There's peace
          enforcing squads stationed all
          about this quadrant. Can't use
          credits out here -- they got to
          pay their boys in cashy money.
          Which once a month rests here.

          ZOE
          Something about stealing from the
          Alliance just warms a body like
          whiskey in winter.

          JAYNE
          (cocks his gun)
          Shiny. Let's be badguys.
          Mal turns back to River.

          MAL
          You ready to go to work, darlin'?

          RIVER
          There's no pattern to the pebbles
          here, they're completely random.
          I tried to count them but you
          drove too fast. Hummingbird.

          MAL
          (never mind)
          Right. Great. Let's go.

          INT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          We are in a camera's eye view, right above the door.

          J

          

          

          

          

          23.
          The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following
          and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking.
          Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
          "Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's
          blown to bits.
          There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
          farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination
          post-office, general store, bank, and most other things.

          MAL
          Hands and knees and heads bowed
          down! Everybody, now!
          Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others.
          Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
          Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very
          much new in design.
          The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
          great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right
          upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! --
          bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Y'all wanna be looking very
          intently at your own belly
          buttons. I see a head start to
          rise, violence is gonna ensue.
          The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
          Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
          shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform.

          JAYNE
          Looks like this is the place.
          He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
          door. She does, and River steps in.
          ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
          over customers as Mal addresses them.

          MAL
          You've probably guessed we mean to
          be thieving here, but what we are
          after is not yours. So let's have
          no undue fussing.
          As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
          finding the small vault locked.

          1410

          

          

          

          

          24.

          JAYNE
          She's locked up.
          River suddenly looks around, perturbed.
          CLOSE ON: a young tough.
          River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
          young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.
          He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.

          ZOE
          You know what the definition of a
          hero is? It's someone who gets
          other people killed. You can look
          it up later.
          He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
          Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him
          toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.

          TRADE AGENT
          This is just a crop moon, don't
          think you'll find what you --

          MAL
          (in Chinese)
          140 
          The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
          safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive.
          Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.

          ZOE
          At last. We can retire and give
          up this life of crime.
          Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
          hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming
          metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal
          addresses the Trade Agent.

          MAL
          Is there a fed down there? Be
          truthful.

          TRADE AGENT

          (NODDING)
          Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought
          for independence?

          MAL
          War's long done. We're all just
          folk now.
          (calls down)
          Listen up! We are coming down to
          empty that vault!
          The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.

          GUARD (O.S.)
          You have to give me your
          authorization password!
          Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
          the hole. A beat...

           GUARD (O . S . )

           (CONTINUING)
          Okay...
          Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:

          INT. VAULT - CONTINUING

          Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A
          short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is
          already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real
          deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed.

          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          We move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry.

          EXT. TOWN - DAY

          A WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are
          looking at the trading station a few buildings away.

          SON
          Repeater.

          WOMAN
          Did sound summat like gunblast...
          Maybe you aught run tell Lawman...
          She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man.
          Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self-
          mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His
          clothes are rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness.
          A blade blurs through frame...

          

          

          

          

          26.

          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          River SCREAMS and flops onto her back, pinned by revelation.
          Others look at her, concerned, as Jayne makes his way to her.

          JAYNE
          What the hell is up? You all
          right? What's goin' on?
          He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed...

          RIVER
          Reavers.

          INT. VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

          Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the
          guard, holding his gun at him:

          MAL
          Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and
          we avoid any necessary organs...

          GUARD
          I was thinking more of a graze..

          MAL
          Well you don't want it to look
          like you just gave up...

          JAYNE (O.S.)

          MAL!

          MAL
          (to himself)
          Every heist, he's gotta start
          yelling my name --

          JAYNE
          (barreling in)
          Mal! Reavers! The girl's
          pitchin' a fit. They're here or
          they're comin' soon.
          He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly.

          MAL
          (to Zoe and Jayne)
          Get on the mule.
          (to the guard,
          pointing to the

          VAULT)
          Does that open from the inside?

          J

          

          

          

          

          27.

          GUARD
          Whah -ah- yes...

          MAL
          You get everyone upstairs in there
          and you seal it. Long as you got
          air you don't open up, you
          understand?

          GUARD
          I -- Buh I --
          Mal is in his face, dark and huge:

          MAL

          GET THEM INSIDE THE VAULT.

          EXT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal
          behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space.
          Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --

          MAL
          Zoe take the wheel --

          JAYNE
          You see 'em? Anybody see 'em?
          1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
          River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly
          moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
          bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.

          YOUNG MAN
          Take me with you!

          MAL
          Get in the vault with the others --

          YOUNG MAN
          I can't stay here! Please!

          MAL
          It's too many. Drive, Zoe.
          A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
          of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded
          conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator,
          pure. It disappears over the rooftops.

          YOUNG MAN

          PLEASE!

          

          

          

          

          28.

          MAL
          Drive!
          Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
          it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust.
          As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
          and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun.
          He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back.
          Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the
          chest, slumps down dead.

          ANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN
          As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff
          shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street,
          right abreast of our gang.

          ANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN
          We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
          come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines
          to swarm into it.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain.
          The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic
          fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire.

          JAYNE
          How come they ain't blowing us out
          of the air?

          MAL
          They wanna run us down. The up-
          close kill.
          River is squashed down on her back, being very small.

          RIVER
          They want us alive when they eat
          us.

          JAYNE
          Boy, sure would be nice if we had
          some grenades, don'tchya think?
          Mal says nothing, keeps firing.

          ZOE
          Wash, baby can you hear me?

          VO

          

          

          

          

          29.

          INT. SERENITY: BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping, prepping for take-off.

          WASH
          We're moments from air. You got
          somebody behind you?
          We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING


          ZOE
          Reavers.

          WASH

          (BLANCHING)
          

          ZOE
          We're not gonna reach you in time.

          WASH
          Just keep moving, honey. We're
          coming to you.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          As she lifts off and starts heading toward the others.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          Zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the
          air from the skiff and S} NK! Goes through Jayne's leg.. The
          harpoon grips the leg and pulls --
          Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing
          him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter --

          MAL
          Grab on!
          Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the
          two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol.

          JAYNE
          I won't get et! You shoot me if
          they take me!
          Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne --

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Well don't shoot me first!

          J

          

          

          

          

          30.
          Mal fires. Again. Steadies himself for one more...
          The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot.

          V0V
          The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground. Mal
          hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room.

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Rutting pigs! Where's --
          And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it.

          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE DESERT - CONTINUING

          Serenity rushes across the desert floor, not much higher off
          it than the smaller crafts.

          WASH
          (to Zoe)
          Get some distance on 'em. You come
          to the flats, I want you to swing
          round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

           Wash hits the com.

           WASH
          J Simon! Open the loading dock!

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front, hits
          a couple of buttons. The doors pull open, as the huge ramp
          beyond them opens down, letting in a rush of wind and light.

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          The mule reaches the flats, away from the rocks.

          WASH (O.S.)
          (in Zoe's ear)
          Okay, baby, we've talked this
          through...

          ZOE
          Talkin' ain't doin'.
          She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about,
          fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff.

          WASH (O.S.)
          Don't slow down!

          

          

          

          

          31.

          ANGLE: THE SKIFF
          As it heads for the mule --

          ANGLE: THE MULE
          As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
           the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up behind it -- The
          Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

           And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as
           it flies backwards into the bay, narrowly missing Simon and
           smashing back into the staircase, sparks and people flying --

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the
          oncoming skiff, tearing it apart --

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          A flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as
          small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
          lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor.
          Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then
          runs to the mule. The C02 stops and he finds River sitting
          in her seat, completely unharmed. Zoe is climbing painfully
          out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown.

          SIMON
          River?

          RIVER
          I swallowed a bug.
          Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is. She goes to Simon.

          KAYLEE
          Are you okay?

          MAL
          Is he okay?
          A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top.
           He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth --
           Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
           both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go
           down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op.
          4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other.

          WASH (O.S.)

          Hello?
          r./ ZOE

          No casualties. Anybody following?

          First thing, I want these bod --
          Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to
          stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          

          SIMON
          You stupid, selfish, son of a
          whore ---

          MAL
          I'm a hair's breadth from riddling
          you with holes, Doctor --

          SIMON
          "One simple job! She'll be fine!"

          MAL
          She IS fine! Except for bein'
          still crazy, she's the picture of
          health!

          ZOE
          Wasn't for River, we'd probably be
          left there. She felt 'em coming.

          giving orders on my boat.

          SIMON
          Well sleep easy 'cause we're off
          your boat. Just as soon as River
          gets her share of the "bounty".

          KAYLEE
          Well let's not do anything hasty...

          MAL
          No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying
          tourists anyhow. We'll be on
          Beaumonde in ten hours time, you
          can pick up your earnings and be
          on your merry. Meantime you do
          your job. Patch up my crew.
          A beat.

          RIVER
          He didn't lie down. They never
          lie down.
          She is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment.

          Mal and Zoe enter from below.

          ZOE
          No, I think things'll glide a deal
          smoother for us without River and
          Simon on board... but how long do
          you think they'll last?

          MAL
          Doc made his call. They's as
          babes in a basket when we took 'em
          in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man
          has to cut loose, learn to stand
          on his own.

          ZOE
          Like that man back in town?
          They stop by Mal Is room.

          MAL

          Reavers woulda done to him before
          they killed him...

          begging us to bring him along...
          vo,

          MAL
          We couldn't take the weight.
          Woulda slowed us down.

          ZOE
          You know that for certain

          MAL
          Mule won't run with five. I
          shoulda dumped the girl? Or you?
          Or Jayne?

          (CONSIDERING)
          Well, Jayne...

          ZOE
          Coulda tossed the payload.

          MAL
          And go to Fanty and Mingo with air
          in our mitts, tell 'em "here's
          your share"? They'd set the dogs
          on us in the space of a twitch,
          and there we are back in mortal
          peril. We get a job, we gotta
          vo make good.
          Washenters from the bridge.

          ZOE
          Sir, I don't disagree on any
          particular point, it's just... in
          the time of war, we woulda never
          left a man stranded.

          MAL
          Maybe that's why we lost.
          She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room
          as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.

          INT. MAL'S ROOM - CONTINUING

          Once alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show. He pulls
          off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toilet
          closed and sits on his bunk.
          The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and
          clutter, ancient maps on the walls.

          INT. INARA'S SHUTTLE

          We're close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused
          exasperation. Behind her is an opulently dressed little
          shuttle.

          INARA
          Kaylee, are you ever gonna put
          that capture down?

          KAYLEE (0.5.)
          We gotta have records of
          everything. A bona fide Companion
          entertained clients on this very
          ship! In this very bed!
          The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending
          over and sniffing curiously. Inara is packing things up.

          KAYLEE (O.S.)

          (CONTINUING)
          For one sweet second, we was
          almost classy.

          INARA
          4 You promised to help me pack.

           KAYLEE (O.S.)
          Honest, Inara, why do you have to
          leave?
          Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
          picture freezes, goes back to the beginning.
          During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a
          moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.

          JAYNE (V.0.)
          I do not get it. How's a guy get
          so wrong?

          INT. CARGO BAY - LATER

          drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continues:

          R

          

          

          

          

          36.

          JAYNE
          Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own
          face, rapin' and murdering -- I
          mean, I'll kill a man in a fair
          fight... or if I think he's gonna
          start a fair fight, or if he
          bothers me, or if there's a woman,
          or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only
          when I'm gettin' paid. But these
          Reavers... last ten years they
          just show up like the boageyman
          from stories. Eating people
          alive? Where does that get fun?
          He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing.

          KAYLEE
          Shepherd Book said they was men
          that reached the edge of space.,
          saw a vasty nothingness and just
          went bibbledy over it.

          JAYNE
          Hell, I been to the edge. Just
          looked like more space.

          KAYLEE
          I don't know. People get awful
          lonely in the black. Like to get
          addlepated ourselves, we stay on
          this boat much longer. Captain'll
          drive us all off, one by one.

          JAYNE
          You're just in a whinge cuz that
          prissy doc is finally
          disembarking. Me I says good
          riddance. He never belonged here,
          and his sister's no saner than one
          of them Reavers.

          KAYLEE
          That ain't even so! River's a
          dear heart and a boon to this
          crew! You just don't like her
          'cause she can read your mind and
          everything you think is mean.

          JAYNE
          Well, there is that.

          J

          

          

          

          

          37.

          KAYLEE
          Her and Simon could have a place
          here. Now they're leaving us.
          Just like Shepherd Book.
          She looks up toward one of the shuttles.

          KAYLEE

          (CONTINUING)
          Just like Inara...

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

          And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes
          half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded
          pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss...
          Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and
          that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
          saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
          heads in the back, also on their knees.
          Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
          speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
          repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her
          the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
          They love you.

          410

          EXT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DUSK

          Inara looks out at the mountains. The space she's in
          resembles a Tibetan monastery, if slightly more opulent.
          Widen to see she is with SHEYDRA, a somewhat older Companion,
          the woman whose voice we heard. She hands Inara a drink.

          SHEYDRA
          The girls. They've learned more
          from you these last months than
          the rest of us could show them in
          two years.

          INARA
          They're very sweet. But they're
          not Companions.

          SHEYDRA

          (WRYLY)
          You've no hope for them? Junk the
          lot, start anew?

          J

          

          

          

          

          38.

          INARA
          On Sihnon we started training at
          twelve. Years of discipline and
          preparation before the physical
          act of pleasure was even
          mentioned. Most of these girls --

          SHEYDRA
          They're all of good family, the
          highest academic standards --

          INARA
          Control. Was the first lesson.
          And the last and these worlds are
          not like the Central Planets.
          There is barbarism dressed up in
          the most civil weeds. Men of the
          highest rank who don't know the
          difference between a Companion and
          a common whore. It's unsafe.

          SHEYDRA
          All the more reason the girls look
          to you. You came out here alone,
          before the Alliance ever thought
          to establish a House this remote.
          You've seen so much. You're a
          figure of great romance to them.
          4d INARA
          Great romance has nothing to do
          with being a Companion, Sheydra.
          You should know better.

          SHEYDRA
          I'm not the one who had a torrid
          affair with a pirate.
          Inara nearly spills her drink.

          INARA
          A who? With a what?

          SHEYDRA

          (SMILING)
          It's the talk of the House. The
          girls all trade stories in the
          dorms at night.

          INARA
          I didn't... have a pirate...

          J

          

          

          

          

          39.

          SHEYDRA
          In one of the stories you make
          love in a burning temple. I think
          that's my favorite.

          INARA

          (SITTING)
          This is unbearable. Captain
          Reynolds is no pirate; he's a
          petty thief. And he never laid a
          finger on me. All he ever did was
          rent me a shuttle and be very
          annoying.
          (mutters in Chinese)
          

          SHEYDRA
          A year on his shuttle and he never
          laid a finger on you. No wonder
          you left.

          INARA

          (BRIDLING)
          I left because -- go away. We're
          no longer friends. You're a
          stranger to me now.

          SHEYDRA
          104 I do love to watch you boil.
          Don't worry. The stories will
          fade. And your Captain Reynolds
          has probably gotten himself blown
          up by this time.

          INARA
          (looking away again)
          Yes. That would be just like him.

          EXT. BEAUMONDE: ATOLL PLAZA - EVENING

          Serenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of
          other, equally disreputable ships. The place is filled with
          every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable.

          EXT./INT. SERENITY - EVENING

           The ramp is open and everyone is filing out, ready to hit the
           town. Kaylee is talking to Simon, who has River in hand.

           KAYLEE
           Don't talk to the barkers -- only
           the captains.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          40.
           KAYLEE (cont'd)
           You look the captain in the eye,
           know who you're dealing with.

          40 SIMON
          â¢ I wish there was...
          Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on:

          KAYLEE
          You shouldn't aughta be so clean.
          It's a dead giveaway you don't
          belong, you always gotta be tidy.
          Don't pay anybody in advance. And
          don't ride in anything with a
          Capissen 38 engine, they fall
          right out of the sky.

          SIMON
          Kaylee.
          She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other
          direction, but River looks after her and the others.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River... do you want to stay with
          them?

          4 RIVER
          It's not safe.

          SIMON
          No, I fear it's not safe anymore.
          He's heading off and doesn't hear:

          RIVER
          For them.

          INT. THE MAIDENHEAD - CONTINUING

          We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the
          screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it
          a smoking ruin.

          NEWSPERSON (V.O.)
          that it was a band of Reavers
          remains unconfirmed. The only
          survivors of the massacre
          apparently locked themselves in
          the Trade Station vault until --

          40

          

          

          

          

          41.
          During this we come around to see that the screen has a
          blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back
          to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the
          corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here.

          40
          We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
          away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories
          straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and
          booths and a second screen playing in the corner.

          MAL
          It's not my fault the Doc's got no
          stomach for Rim living --

          KAYLEE
          It is entirely and for all your
          fault! If you'd given Simon a
          moment, just a moment where he
          didn't think you were gonna throw
          them off or turn them in, he
          might've --

          MAL
          What? Swept you into his cleanly
          arms? Made tidy love to you?
          They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
          already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat:
          Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the
          q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A
          large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.

          KAYLEE
          (as they continue

          DOWN)
          Don't you dare joke! You know how
          much I pined on Simon. And him
          fair sweet on me, I well believe,
          but he's so worried about being
          found out --

          ZOE
          Captain didn't make 'em fugitives.

          KAYLEE
          But he coulda made 'em family!
          Steada driving them off. Steada
          keeping Simon from seein' I was
          there, when I carried such a torch
          and we coulda -- goin' on a year
          now I ain't had nothin' twixt my
          nethers weren't run on batteries!

          40

          

          

          

          

          42.

          MAL
          Oh god! I can't know that!

          JAYNE
          40 I could stand to hear a little
          more...

          KAYLEE
          If you had a care for anybody's
          heart you woulda --

          MAL

          (ENOUGH)
          You knew he was gonna leave. We
          never been but a way station to
          those two. And how do you know
          what he feels? He's got River to
          worry on but he still coulda shown
          you... if I truly wanted someone
          bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in
          the 'verse could stop me from
          going to her.

          KAYLEE
          Tell that to Inara.
          For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.

          MINGO
          4 Domestic troubles?
          MINGO is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a
          fur-trader. Sounds lower-class British, or something like it.

          FANTY
          Domestic troubles?
          FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is
          Mingo's identical twin. Apart from slight differences in
          dress, they are indistinguishable.

          MINGO
          'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.

          FANTY
          A man should keep his house in
          order.

          MAL
          (greets them each)
          Mingo. Fanty.

          14

          

          

          

          

          43.

          MINGO
          (pointing at his

          BROTHER)
          He's Mingo.
          ,do

          MAL
          He's Fanty. You're Mingo.

          MINGO
          Ghahh! How is it you always know?

          MAL
          Fanty's prettier.
          (pulling out a chair)
          Feel to do some business?

          MINGO
          (re: Mal Is gang)
          Bit crowded, isn't it? As you
          see, we come unencumbered by thugs.

          MAL
          Which means at least four of the
          guys already in here are yours.
          All's one. I'll just keep Jayne
          with me.

          ZOE
           Sir, are you sure you don't --

          4

          MAL
          Go. Go get yourselves a nice
          romantic meal.

          WASH
          Those are my two favorite words!
          (to Zoe)
          Honey... "Meal..."

          MAL
          (to Zoe)
          It's business. We're fine.
          They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a
          few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance...
          ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently
          blocked by her little dance.
          Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.

          MINGO
          Quite a crew you've got.

          4

          

          

          

          

          44.

          MAL
          Yeah, they're a fine bunch of
          ruebens.

          MINGO
          How you keep them on that crap
          boat is the subject of much musing
          tween me and Fanty.

          FANTY
          We go on and on.

          MAL
          So I'm noticing. Is there a
          problem I don't know of? You got
          25% of a sweet take kissing your
          foot, how come we're not
          dispersing?

          FANTY
          Our end is forty, precious.

          JAYNE
          My muscular buttocks it's forty --

          MINGO
          It is as of now. Find anyone
          around going cheaper.

          J FANTY
          Find anyone around going near a
          sorry lot like you in the first
          instance.
          ANGLE: RIVER has entered, is looking about.
          Jayne sees her, nudges Mal, who looks and turns back to
          business. We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter
          of the bar, vaguely listening in on Mal's deal.

          FANTY

          (CONTINUING)
          You're unlikable, Mal. You got no
          respect for us above you, you got
          enemies in every quadrant, and
          your ship's older than the
          starting point of time. You's
          charity cases to such as us.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          MAL
          Well here's a foul thought. I
          conjured you two were incompetent;
          sent us out not knowing there were
          V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking
          you picked us out because you did.

          MINGO
          That were a sign of faith, boy.
          And it doesn't affect our forty
          per. Danger is, after all, your
          business.

          JAYNE
          Reavers ain't business, double
          dickless.
          This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the
          CV screen, on which is a commercial. It's animated, goofy,
          cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming
          to insane fantasy figures as they sing about:

          COMMERCIAL

          FRUITY OATY BARS, POW! HEY! FRUITY

          BARS, MAKE A MAN OF A MOUSE, MAKE

          YOU BUST OUT YOUR BLOUSE, EAT THEM

          NOW, BANG! PING! ZOW! -- TRY

          FRUITY, OATY BARS.
          We push in, the light from the CV on River's face, pushing to
          EXTREME CLOSE UP, all noise but the jingle fading out,
          finally that as well, just the hum in River's ears.
          And she whispers:

          RIVER
          Miranda.
          She turns and looks back at the crowd.
          What happens next happens very fast.
           She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
          quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips
           it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as --
           people are turning, just registering that this girl --
          kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a
          bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her
          square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people
          are rising, fleeing or pushing forward --

          River...

          JAYNE
          V0 Whuhuh?
          She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect
          precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out
          a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
          her head, using his momentum to stab the other one --
          Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches
          her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
          Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
          the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
          She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
          the room itself to take out every single person there. One
          man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
          around the corner and nails his face.
          Jayne grabs her from behind --

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          Gorrammit, girl, it's me!
          She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
          spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm,
          V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
           of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table --
          Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
          scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
          Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
          knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
          then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with
          his, they are pointed right at each other --

          SIMON
          Eta Kooram Nah Smech!
          And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
          There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon,
          who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing.
          He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.

          MAL
          I think maybe we ought to leave.

           We see two sleek warships glide silently into frame, followed
           by a third, bigger ship. This is the operative's vessel, and

          Hello again. Yes, it's me. I'm

          An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor:

          He looks over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on
          his lips -- as his glasses are covered by text.

          ENSIGN
          Sir?

          THE OPERATIVE
          Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle
          of the entire war. The
          Independents held the valley for
          seven weeks, two of them after
          their high command had
          surrendered. 68% casualty rate.

          He exits to find the whole group waiting for him, sans Wash.

          MAL
          She's still napping just now. And

          You feel to elaborate on what that

          Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him.

          Mal steps aside. Simon enters the locker.

          The camera swoops in at a sparking ion cloud, then through

          He's surrounded by screens, computers, feeds -- machinery

          I'm not a multiple, dumbo.

          SIMON
          No. Right. But I think somehow
          when they triggered you it brought
          this up, this memory --

          RIVER
          It isn't mine. The memory. I
          didn't bring it and I shouldn't
          have to carry it, it isn't mine.

          (URGENTLY:)
          Don't make me sleep again.

          SIMON
          I won't.

          RIVER
          Put a bullet to me. Bullet in the
          brain pan, squish.

          SIMON
          Don't say that. Not ever. We'll
          get through this.
          She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately.

          RIVER
          Things are going to get much much
          worse.

          SIMON
          Well, the Captain hasn't tossed us
          in the airlock, so I'd say we're --

          He has to see. More than
          anyone... he has to see what he

          Death.

          SIMON
          Whose death?
          And she starts laughing. Quietly at first, then louder, then
          almost uncontrollably, screaming in his face:

          INT. CAVE - DAY

          It's pitch black here, til Serenity's lights throw a hard
          relief on the rocky wall. She flies in after, slow and
          steady, revealing herself to be in a huge mineshaft.

          ANGLE: THE RAMP lowers to reveal Shepherd BOOK, a working-

          We see the camp: a few shacks and a working mine, as our
          group come down to it, greeted by a few miners, including an
          eight year old boy that rushes to Kaylee...
          ANGLE ON: A CANNON mounted at the edge of town. The guy
          manning it sees them arrive, also goes to greet them.

          We see the gang sitting and eating. Comfortable, even
          laughing a bit. Jayne presents Book with a couple of cigars.
          Kaylee hoists the boy on her lap.

          Inara stands waiting, her back to us, in front of the very
          vista we first saw her before.

          TEACHER
          River?
          Eight-year-old River is working away, not paying attention.

          River, you look tired. I think
          everybody's a little tired by now;
          why don't we all lie down.
          River looks up, scared. All the other children wordlessly
          get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to them.

          You could use a gun hand?

          INARA
          I'm hoping not. But if you were

          could take your ease here a
          while... and there'd be payment...

          Payment is never not a factor. I
          could sound out the crew... This
          pot like to boil over soon?

          Soon. Not right away.

          What are you doing?

          INARA
          I'm praying for you, Mal.

          THE OPERATIVE
          That's very thoughtful. But I
          mean it when I say you're not in
          any danger.

          MAL
          Speak your piece.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I think you're beginning to
          understand how dangerous River Tam
          is.

          MAL
          She is a mite unpredictable. Mood
          swings, of a sort.

          THE OPERATIVE
          It's worse than you know.

          MAL
          It usually is.

          THE OPERATIVE
          That girl will rain destruction
          down on you and your ship. She's
          an albatross, Captain.

          68.

          MAL
          Way I remember it, albatross was
          a ship's good luck... til some
          idiot killed it.
          (to Inara)
          Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to
          faint.
          The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he
          moves, Mal counters.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I've seen your war record. I know
          how you must feel about the
          Alliance.

          MAL
          You really don't.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Fair to say. But I have to hope
          you understand you can't beat us.

          MAL
          I got no need to beat you. I just
          wanna go my way.

          THE OPERATIVE
          And you can do that, once you let
          me take the girl back home. Give
          me the opportunity to help you.

          MAL
          All I gotta do is let you take one
          more thing away from me. I've had
          a lot of things taken in my time.
          And it may just be that this is
          one too many.

          THE OPERATIVE
          This psychotic, potentially
          murderous girl who can't have the
          slightest awareness of your
          protection. This is where you
          "draw the line".

          MAL
          Well I'm a whimsical soul.

          THE OPERATIVE
          There's a number of lives that
          hang in the balance here. Lives
          under your care. Are they as
          whimsical as yourself?

          

          

          

          

          69.

          MAL
          I got no notion that I'm being
          heroical at all. Any more than I
          think you're really just a
          harmless bureaucrat come to help
          me out. You move like a killer.
          The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:

          THE OPERATIVE
          I have a warship in deep orbit,
          Captain. We locked on to
          Serenity's pulse beacon the moment
          you hit atmo. I can speak a word
          and send a missile to that exact
          location inside of three minutes.
          Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
          around it, and tosses it to the Operative.

          MAL
          You do that, best make peace with
          your dear and fluffy lord.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Pulse beacon.

          MAL
          Advice from an old tracker: you
          J wanna find someone, use your eyes.

          THE OPERATIVE
          How long do you think you can
          really run from us?

          MAL
          Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I
          never credited the Alliance with
          an over-abundance of brains. And
          if you're the best they got...

          THE OPERATIVE
          Captain Reynolds, I should tell
          you so that you don't waste your
          time: You can't make me angry.

          INARA
          Oh please. Spend an hour with him.
          Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!"

          

          

          

          

          70.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I need her, Captain. River is...
          my purpose and I will gather her
          to me. The brother as well.
          Whatever else happens is
          incidental. In the greater scheme.

          MAL
          Why is it that the greater scheme
          always makes everything not that
          great?

          THE OPERATIVE
          I want to resolve this like
          civilized men. I'm not
          threatening you. I'm unarmed.

          MAL
          Great!
          He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
          Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
          The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I am of course wearing full body
          armor. I'm not a moron.
          He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
          blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
          but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
          Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
          kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
          to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
          dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.

          MAL
          No back up? We're making an awful
          ruckus...

          THE OPERATIVE
          They'll come when they're needed.

          MAL
          I'd start whistling.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Captain, what do you think is
          going to happen here?
          They come at each other. The Operative is the much better
          trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.

          40

          

          

          

          

          71.
          Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
          precision is wearing Mal down.
          Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
          V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
          breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
          places her hand on his arm.
          The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
          his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
          fascination as he looks at it.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          Nothing here is what it seems.

          INARA
          I know.

          THE OPERATIVE
          He's not the plucky hero. The
          Alliance isn't some evil empire.
          This isn't the grand arena.

          INARA
          And that's not incense.
          He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like
          a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.

          40
          It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
          goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz.
          The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
          soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
          Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUING

          Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps
          and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird.

          MAL
          .I had him...

          INARA
          What?

          MAL
          (deafly loud)
          I think that I was winning!

          EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, BY MAL'S SHUTTLE - DAY

          Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to
          see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
          V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking
          grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
          the foursome.
          CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
          one by one, counting down --

          ALLIANCE SOLDIER
          Grenade!
          Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
          race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
          the last light goes out and nothing happens.
          One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
          door shuts on him and Inara.

          INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

          Inara pushes into the pilot's seat.

          INARA
          Hang on to something.

          MAL
          4 You sure you remember how it --
          He nearly falls over as:

          EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUING

          The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out.

          INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

          Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the
          controls. Mal is gone.

          INARA
          I told you to hang on.

          MAL (O.S. )
          (in great pain)
          I'm fine...

          EXT. SPACE - LATER

          We are below Serenity as her bay doors are closing, six
          little objects floating out of her belly like roe.

          4

          

          

          

          

          73.
          These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly
          home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly. They
          all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different
          directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect
          and burns away from us.

          INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

          The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (into a com)
          Forget the pulse beacon, there has
          to be another way to track the
          ship -- get a read on the nav sat.
           It's a registered transport, you
           must be able to locate --

           ENSIGN (O.S.)
          Sir?

          THE OPERATIVE
          Have you found a nav sat
          trajectory?

          ENSIGN (O.S.)
          Sir... we've found seven.
          The Operative looks more unhappy than angry.

          THE OPERATIVE
          (to himself)
          Does he think this is a game?

          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in
          the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle-
          holes in her head -- makes her way through them.
          Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is
          the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and
          planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes
          in to one system, one planet...
          She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see:

          INT. LAB - CONTINUING

          Her POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in
          formal dress. They stare at her, impassive.
          We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city
          streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face --

          .00

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER - DAY

          And River awakens. A moment to get her bearings, then her
          eyes narrow with intent.

          INARA (V.0.)
          We have every reason to be afraid.

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING


          JAYNE
          Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal?
          That ain't so hard --

          MAL
          He didn't beat me up --

          INARA
          Because he's a believer.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP, A DARK CABIN

          As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs.
          Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters.

          INARA (V.0.)
          He's intelligent, methodical and
          devout in his belief that killing
          River is the right thing to do.

          INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING


          INARA
          I honestly think the only reason
          we haven't been blown out of the
          air is that he needs to see her.

          SIMON
          Needs to see her why?

          INARA
          I'm uncertain. I would say to be
          sure of the kill, but... I just
          know he'll kill us all to get to
          her.

          JAYNE
          So no hope of a reward, huh?

          ZOE
          Did he mention a deal of any kind?

          IWO

          Give the two of them up. Go my
          way.

          JAYNE
          Which you was all ready to do not
          a day ago. What went sour?

          MAL
          Cutting them loose ain't the same
          as handing them over.

          JAYNE
          That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm
          about to become is having trouble
          telling the difference.

          SIMON
          (to Inara)
          Did he say anything about a
          "Miranda"?

          INARA
          What is that?

          MAL
          Don't know who or what, but it's
          on River's mind. Conjure it might
          be the reason he's after her.

          INARA
          You think maybe it poses some kind
          of threat to the Alliance?

          WASH
          Do we care? Are we caring about
          that?

          JAYNE
          You dumbass hogs, the only people
          she's a threat to is us on this
          boat!

          INT. STORAGE LOCKER - CONTINUING

          River is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split
          again, feet against the walls. There is a wire mesh cover to
          the light, and she has bent part of it out, is working it
          inside the lock of her shackles.

          JAYNE
          Hiding under the Shepherd's
          skirts, that's a manful scheme --

          Yes!

          Getting us lashed over a couple of
          strays...
          (to Simon)
          No offense, Doc, I think it's
          noble as a grape the way you look
          to River, but she ain't my sister
          (to Mal)
          and she ain't your crew. Oh, and
          neither is she exactly helpless!
          So where's it writ we gotta lay
          down our lives for her, which is
          what you've steered us toward.

          MAL
          I didn't start this.

          JAYNE
          No, the Alliance starts the war --
          and then you volunteer. Battle of
          Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here,
          how many --
          (Mal turns away)
          -- I'm talkin' at you -- how many
          men in your platoon came out of
          there alive?
          Mal stares at him.

          ZOE
          (dead cold)
          You wanna leave this room.

          INARA
          This isn't the war, Mal.
          Mal turns, eyeing her.

          MAL
          Are you telling me that because
          you think I don't know --

          INARA
          You came to the training house
          looking for a fight.

          MAL
          I came looking for you.

          INARA
          I just want to know who I'm
          dealing with. I've seen too many
          versions of you to be sure.

          MAL
          I start fighting a war I guarantee
          you'll see something new.

          TO
          Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over:

          SIMON
          We'll get off. River and I'll get
          off at Haven and find some --

          KAYLEE

          I got no answers for you, Inara.
          I got no rudder. Wind blows
          40 northerly, I go north. That's who
          I am. Maybe that ain't a man to
          lead but they have to follow so

          Jayne is looking at the storage locker door. A beat.

          He moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door. Goes
          40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun.

          shuttle ride --
          He opens the door and she is on him in an instant, whip blow
          to the throat, the nose -- he fires wildly as she jumps on
          him, wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back --

          INT. AFT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          The crew enters, drawn by the shots. Mal is first -- can't
          open the door. Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne...

          MAL
          The other way! Find her and-do
          not engage!
          Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in
          the window.

          He starts, then waits as she opens the door.

          NO

          SIMON
          It's gonna be oka --
          She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees,
          shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He
          doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off.

          INT. CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the
          upstairs. He gives up, looking around.

          ZOE
          She's sealed off the bridge. I do
          not like her there.

          KAYLEE
          Cap'n!
          She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out
          of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe:

          MAL
          Check the shuttles. She coulda
          40 snuck in.
          He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - LATER

          A floor panel hinges open, Mal pulling himself up. He moves
          quietly to the bridge, gun drawn.
          He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates
          on a big Cortex screen she's pulled out by the copilot's
          seat. She whips Jayne's gun at his face, never looking at
          him. A moment, and Mal lowers his own gun.

          MAL
          The government's man, he says
          you're a danger to us. Not worth
          helping. Is he right? Are you
          anything but a weapon? I've

          INT. BRIDGE - LATER

          Everyone has gathered. Wash is piloting now, as they are in
          atmosphere. River is by Simon. She moves restlessly, upset.

          KAYLEE
          How can it be there's a whole
          planet called Miranda and none of
          us knowed that?

          MAL
          Because there isn't one. It's a
          blackrock. Uninhabitable.
          Terraforming didn't hold, or
          somesuch. Few settlers died.

          RIVER
          (to Simon)
          I had to show them. I didn't know
          if you were going to make me sleep.

          You could've asked...

          Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years
          back, before the war. There was
          call for workers to settle on
          Miranda, my daddy talked about
          going. I should've recalled...

          WASH
          But there's nothing about it on
          the Cortex -- History,
          Astronomy... it's not in there.

          MAL
          Half of writing history is hiding
          the truth. There's something on
          this rock the Alliance doesn't
          want known.

          She hits some commands on the screen, pulls back to reveal a
          couple of other planets near Miranda.

          ZOE
          This is us, see? And here's
          Miranda. All along here, this
          dead space in between, that's
          Reaver territory.

          Alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down.

          Kaylee heads for the burning church.

          KAYLEE
          Shepherd? Shepherd Book!
          She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple. There is
          the body on the ground, face down. The child she played with
          at dinner. Kaylee stares, at first uncomprehending.
          ANGLE: MAL, moving in the other direction, approaches the

          Every one shows fire, destruction or the snow of an
          interrupted signal.
          Mal stands alone amidst the screens, saying nothing. After
          a long moment, all of the screens hitch, the images replaced
          by identical images of the Operative. He looks solemn.

          THE OPERATIVE
          V0 I'm sorry. But I cannot let you
          hide and I cannot let you run.
          Things become... extreme. And we

          MAL
          Don't talk at me like a righteous

          When God wanted Pharaoh to release

          He sent his plagues down upon
          Egypt. That's me, Captain. The

          corpses. It's always been so.

          MAL
          Why? Do you know why?

          THE OPERATIVE
          It's not my place to ask.

          MAL
          You will never see River Tam. I'm
          telling you this.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Maybe not. But you'll keep her
          close now, and when I blow
          Serenity out of the air, this will
          be ended. You're so terribly out
          of your depth, Captain. Your old
          boat can't take the pressure.

          She ain't buckled yet. And the
          40 only reason you're talking such a
          lot is you can't get a fix on us.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Yes, your scrambler's code is too
          old for our seekers. You love
          that, yes? The small triumph over
          modernity. You really are the

          Miranda, maybe finding out what
          all I'm dying for. That's my

          CLOSE ON THE BODIES as they BURN, flames passing over them
          and suddenly flickering out as dark falls. They are patches
          of leathered flesh stretched over bone -- monsters, screaming
          soundlessly in the nothing of space.
          We arm past them to the windows of the bridge, looking in at
          Mal, watching, with Zoe behind and Wash at the helm.
          And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the
          first time: It is hardly recognizable. Charred corpses on
          the nose, Cannon atop with a space-suited corpse draped
          within, long scars, welded-on parts and war paint... the
          trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor.
          It looks, for all the world, like a Reaver ship.

          The group make their way toward the bridge. Those close

          those already on the bridge are stock still. Pressed up
          against the glass of the window is River, just staring.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Reverse to see: an armada.
          The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a
          vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them.
          Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly
          about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around.
          Vd INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
          They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada...

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          And arrive, moving slowly through the ranks of ships.
          Serenity passes a large, bizarrely shaped ship. It turns, as
          though watching her. But lets her pass.
          Another minute, and Serenity is through the Armada, headed
          for the small planet just beyond.

          GAAAAaaoh God --
          -- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach.
          It's an office. About half the employees are there, in
          chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first
          fellow. We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates...

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - DAY

          It's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying
          vehicles. At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged,
          is an Alliance Research Vessel. The gang makes its way
          towards it.

          INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - DAY

          It's a mess, doors pried open, signs of violence but no
          bodies. The gang walks through it, looking around.
          River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined. She
          approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object. She
          turns it slightly --
          A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see
          images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses,
          everywhere. We hear and then see DOCTOR CARON standing
          exactly where she was when she recorded this message...
          (As she speaks, we see angles of everyone watching, taking it
          in.. River silently mouths every word.)

          isn't.. it isn't what we thought.
          There's been no war here, and no
          terraforming event. The
          environment is stable. It's the
          Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate
          that we added to the air
          processors. It's...
          (tearing up)
          .well it works... it was
          supposed to calm the population,
          weed out aggression. Make a
          peaceful... it worked. The people
          here stopped fighting. And then
          they stopped everything else.
          They stopped going to work,
          stopped breeding... talking...
          eating...
          (trying for control)
          There's thirty million people here
          and they all just let themselves
          die. They didn't even kill
          themselves. They just... most
          starved. When they stopped
          working the power grids, there
          were overloads, fires -- people
          burned to death sitting in their
          V0 chairs. Just sitting.
          There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts,
          gathers herself.

          I have to be quick. There was no

          There are people... they're not

          opposite reaction to the Pax.

          JAYNE

          (NODDING)
          She was a fun grandma.

          SIMON
          Do we have a plan?

          MAL
          Mr Universe. We haven't the
          equipment to broadwave this code,
          but he can put it on every screen
          for thirty worlds. He's pretty
          damn close, too.

          RIVER
          Based on our orbital trajectories,
          he reached optimum proximity just
          before our sunset. If we make a
          direct run within the hour we're
          only 67,332 miles out. At full
          burn we'd reach him inside of
          three- hours .

          4

          

          

          

          

          99.
          She doesn't notice the reactions to her sudden clarity --
          she's still somewhat in her own world.

          WASH
          Still got the Reavers, and
          probably the Alliance between us
          and him.

          ZOE
          It's a fair bet the Alliance knows
          about Mr Universe. They're gonna
          see this coming.

          MAL
          No.
          He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          They're not gonna see this coming.
           CLOSE ON: One of Serenity's jet engines, as it FIRES up.

          EXT. CITY - AFTERNOON

          Serenity is taking off, leaving the dead place behind.

          INT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - CONTINUING

          He's talking with Mal and Wash again, very animated.

          MR UNIVERSE
          It's no problem! Bring it on
          bring it on bring it on! From
          here to the eyes and ears of the
          'verse, that's my motto, or it
          might be if I start having a motto.

          MAL (ON SCREEN)
          We won't be long.

          MR UNIVERSE
          You're gonna get caught in the ion
          cloud, it'll play merry hob with
          your radar, but pretty pretty
          lights and a few miles after
          you'll be right in my orbit.

          MAL (ON SCREEN)
          You'll let us know if anyone else
          comes at you?

          

          

          

          

          100.
          DROP BACK WIDE to see: The Operative and ten soldiers are in
          the room, visible to Mr Universe but not to the screen.

          MR UNIVERSE
          You'll be the first.
          CLOSE ON: the Operative's sword, as he unsheathes it.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          We are amongst the Reaver armada. Serenity slices quietly
          through the ships, as we come around and see Miranda receding
          in the distance.
          Serenity drifts through the armada -- and suddenly another
          ship fires up, running next to her...
          The two ships pace each other, another vessel coming about as
          though staring at Serenity, who comes closer and closer to
          frame, till we see the suited corpse draped on the cannon.
          It suddenly moves: it's Mal.
          He swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them.
          It BLOWS, fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into
          other ships, causing two smaller ones to blow as well.
          Mal swings around and fires at another ship.

          EXT. SATELLITE - NIGHT

          In close orbit waits the Alliance force, at least fifty
          strong, and clearly with high tech firepower. We move in on
          the Operative's ship, in the middle of the cluster.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          As the Operative waits with the others.

          HELMSMAN

          Lock and fire on my command.
          (to himself)
          You should have let me see her.
          We should have done this as men.
          Not with fire...

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          It's the Operative's POV: the swirling Ion cloud as Serenity
          breaks through and heads at us, fully Reavered out.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          He looks confused, then smiles at the ruse. Hits the com:

          THE OPERATIVE
          Vessel in range, lock on...

          (ADMIRINGLY)
          Bastard's not even changing
          course...

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

           As Serenity get a bit closer, FIFTY REAVER SHIPS suddenly
           burst from the cloud, also heading straight at us.

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          The Operative -- and everyone around him - goes big-eyed.

          THE OPERATIVE
          That's not good...

          HELMSMAN

          (FREAKING)
          Sir?

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity suddenly lists hard to port -- until she's almost
          upside down -- the Alliance ships FIRE, missing Serenity but
           tagging a few Reaver ships, none of whom have slowed down --

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal is back on the bridge as we look out at the upside down
          Alliance fleet, missiles just passing us --

          MAL
          We're too close for them to arm --

          ZOE
          This is gonna be very tight --

          JAYNE

          (ENTERING)
          Hey look, we're upside down.
          V0 Zoe and Mal shoot a look at Jayne.

          WASH
          (to himself)
          I am a leaf on the wind, watch how
          I soar.

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and
          weaves between dozens more. The Reaver force hits the
          Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing
          into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding --
          The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around,
          and an air war begins, a frenzied, balletic ecstasy of
          destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and
          parts of ships fly at and past it.

          ANGLE: SERENITY
          She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet
          before a barrelling chunk of debris -- which is twice their
          size -- forces them to come hard about and remain in the fray.

          J INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

           Mal looks out at the chaos...

           MAL
           Chickens come home to roost...
           They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another
           ship -- Wash struggles to control her --

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          The hell --

          WASH

          (PANICKY)
          It's okay! I am a leaf on the

          What does that mean?

          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING

          Serenity makes her way past the carnage and heads down toward
          the tiny satellite moon.

          40

          INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          As the vessel shakes, clearly breached, The Operative moves
          to a door marked: DART. He puts his thumb to a panel and the
          door slides up to reveal a standing, almost formfitting one-
          man cockpit.

          EXT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CONTINUING

          The Dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface. As
          it moves from the Operative's ship, we see that a Reaver
          vessel has smashed into the main viewshield, and the ship is
          spinning, explosions popping silently all over it.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          She continues down, the metallic expanse of Mr Universe's
          little moon complex sprawling below them. A moment after
          Serenity blows through frame, so does a Reaver ship.
          It fires an electronic pulse at Serenity and sparks fly.

           INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING


          4 WASH
           We're fried! I got no control!

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING

           Sparks -- and arcs of electricity -- are everywhere here.
           Kaylee jumps back as she is electrocuted -- Simon runs in and
           pulls her out, slams the door shut on the erupting fires.

           INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING


           MAL
           Where's the back up? Where's the
           back up?
           He and Wash are frantically flipping buttons -- the ship
           whirs to a semblance of life - -

           ZOE
           Back up reads at 20%..

          Everybody to the upper decks!
          Strap yourselves to something!

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

          We can see it, a long strip, which halfway along becomes a
          kind of hanger. Serenity arcs at it uncomfortably fast.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as Zoe
          pulls out a seat as well, straps in.

          INT. AFT HALL - CONTINUING

          Jayne, Simon and Inara pull harnesses not unlike "Batman the
          Ride" seats from the ceiling, help the others in.

          EXT./INT. LANDING STRIP/HANGER - CONTINUING

          -40 And Serenity HITS the ground -- the landing gear folds and
          snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going, now inside
          the hanger, heading towards the entrance to the facility,
          slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
          goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian
          area, so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but
          the body of the ship is hidden from it.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          There is a moment of quiet.

          WASH
          I am a leaf on the wind. Watch --
          A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales
          him to his chair. It's as thick around as a telephone pole.
          Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead.

          WASH!
          She moves to him --

          40

          Wash baby baby no, come on, you
          gotta move you gotta move baby
          VW please --
          Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
          slams through the window into the wall above them.

          EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

          We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start
          out of it. A second Reaver vessel enters frame from above,
          about to land next to it.

          EXT. SERENITY - MOMENTS LATER

          The cargo bay door opens -- just the little door housed
          inside the ramp -- and Jayne comes out with his biggest gun.
          He looks up, toward the edge of the runway, but no Reavers
          have arrived yet.

          JAYNE
          Go!
          The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons.

          MAL
          Head inside!

          V0

          INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          A small double-sized doorway leads to the "Black Room", which
          is the entrance proper to the facility.
          Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the
          sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square
          hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the
          black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that
          point to an elevator some fifty feet away.

          MAL
          Come on. Jayne, rearguard.
          Zoe slows, looking around her.

          ZOE

          No. They have to come through

          can thin 'em out. We get pushed
          ,oO
          back there's the blast doors.

          KAYLEE

          Then shut 'em and hide til --

          ZOE
          We need to draw them til it's
          done. This is the place. We'll
          buy you the time.

          JAYNE
          (to the others)
          Move those crates back there for
          cover -- and make sure they ain't
          filled with anything goes boom.

          KAYLEE
          Wait, Wash -- where's Wash?
          Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there. Zoe is dead calm.
          ,No ZOE
          He ain't comin'.
          Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up.

          JAYNE
          Move the gorram crates! Come on!
          We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- they're
          approaching. Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him.

          ANGLE: HIS POV
          Reavers rush toward them.
          He turns to Jayne.

          MAL
          Tell me you brought 'em this
          time...
          Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own
          and fastballs it at the Reavers.

          It explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about.
          Mal rolls his a shorter distance, then slams the door shut.

          ANGLE: THE GRENADE

          40
          Explodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a
          catwalk -- right in front of the door.
          In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the
          explosion. Everyone takes positions behind the crates. Zoe
          stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off.

          MAL
          (continuing; moving
          back to Zoe)
          Zoe... are you here?
          She looks up at him.

          ZOE
          Do the job, sir.

          MAL
          You hold. Hold till I'm back.
          He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look
          for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone.
          Jayne moves over to Zoe.

          10

          JAYNE
          Captain's right. Can't be

          get through this.

          ZOE
          You really think any of us are
          gonna get through this?
          He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a
          mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River. A beat,
          and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope:

          The elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of
          screens and machines in the center of the space.
          The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has
          been destroyed. The second:

          from his chair.

          Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away again and
          the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible
          whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness,
          and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice.

          Mal stops.

          LOVEBOT

          Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me
          with a sword. How weird is that?
          I got... a short span here... they
          destroyed my equipment but I have
          a back-up unit... bottom of the
          complex, right over the generator.
          Hard to get to. I know they
          missed it. They can't stop the
          signal, Mal. They can never stop
          the signal.

          Okay this is painful. On many
          levels. I'm not --

          A beat, and Mal takes off.

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          Inara is on her knees, unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her

          Just stay low. I'm right here.

          Jayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her.

          JAYNE
          She picked a sweet bung of a time
          to go helpless on us.

          ZOE
          (calls out)
          Jayne and I take the first wave.
          Nobody shoots less they get past
          our fire.
          Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on
          the door continue.

          KAYLEE
          Oh, I didn't plan on going out
          like this. I think we did right,
          but...

          SIMON
          I never planned... anything. I
          just wanted to keep River safe.
          Spent so much time on Serenity
          trying to find us a home I never
          realized I already had.
          She looks at him with soft surprise.

          140

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          My one true regret in all this is
          never being with you.

          KAYLEE
          With me? You mean to say, as, sex?

          SIMON

          (SMILES)
          I mean to say.
          Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than
          we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door.

          KAYLEE
          Hell with this. I'm gonna live.
          Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the
          door.
          Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth:
          a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace.
          ANGLE: THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges.

          INT. MR UNIVERSE'S HQ - CONTINUING

          A panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops
          down, having clearly entered from a different location.
          He looks around, carrying a laser-pistol. He moves past Mr
          Universe and Lenore --

          LOVEBOT

          MAL
          (The Operative turns)
          Guy killed me, Mal.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal has reached it and surveys the situation.
          Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the
          generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and
          grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it.
          On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console
          sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains
          run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.

          MAL
          Hard to get to. That's a fact.

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          lwï¿½
          The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
          squeeze through and charge.
          Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
          as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward
          the door --

          JAYNE
          Zoe... Gorramnit...
          But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the
          bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots,
          each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo.
          The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
          precision of military training still in her as she flips him,
          wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame,
          bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open
          and she's rushed from behind ---
           But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot,
          moving forward himself --

          J

          

          

          

          

          JAYNE

          (CONTINUING)
          ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line!
          voï¿½ She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets
          comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
          blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
          his neck.
          Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER

          Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the
          ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong
          move and he pitches into the jaws of death...
          A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs
          sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
          backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he
          falls, mercifully, back onto the platform.
          The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
          as Mal gets shakily up.

          MAL
          (in pain)
          Shot me in the back. I haven't...
          made you angry, have I?
          I s

          THE OPERATIVE
          There's a lot of innocent people
          in the air being killed right now.

          MAL
          You have no idea how true that is.
          There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing
          off at ten paces.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I know the secret now. The truth
          that burned up River Tam's brain
          and set you after her. And the
          rest of the 'verse is gonna know
          it too. 'Cause they need to.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You really believe that?

          MAL
          I do.

          You willing to die for that belief?

          MAL

          V0
          I am.
          The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw
          master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets
          two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Of course, that ain't exactly plan

          A..
          He drops out his cartridge and slams another in.
          The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
          at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
          Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
          going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
          The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
          been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
          in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
          grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
          He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
          4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
          Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
          pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
          swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
          He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
          the platform from above.

          INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

          Jayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to
          the barricades. Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now,
          squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's
          shirt, checks the wound.

          SIMON
          Spine's intact --

          ZOE
          Just gimme a bandage.
          Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a
          foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering.

          113.
          There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades)
           from the Reavers. Jayne switches weapons, tossing another to
          Zoe and opening fire --

          A0

          JAYNE
          Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh?
          Cheaters!
          He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing.
          River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
          starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
          projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
          projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as
          Zoe shouts:

          ZOE
          Everybody fall back! Fall back!
          Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor.
          Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from
          each side and above and below. Then, when the hole is maybe
          four by four, they stop.

          ZOE

          (CONTINUING)
          Jayne! Grenade!

          JAYNE
          Very last one...
          He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from
          the blast as she thinks.

          ZOE
          They're gonna get in --

          KAYLEE
          Can close it... from outside...

          ZOE
          No one's coming back from that...
          She tries to stand, fails.

          ZOE

          (CONTINUING)
          How much ammo do we have?

          JAYNE
          We got three full cartridges and
          my swingin' cod. That's all.
          Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.---

          Lift isn't moving...

          ZOE
          When they come, try to plug the
          hole with 'em...
          Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her.

          KAYLEE
          I'm starting to lose some feeling
          here... I think there's something
          in them darts they throwed at me.

          SIMON
          Lie still. I'm gonna give you
          something to counteract the --
          He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          My bag.
          and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
          suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
          lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
          right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
          River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
          Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
          cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.

          INARA
          Keep pressure here...

          SIMON
          My bag. Need... adrenaline... and
          a shot of calaphar for Kaylee...
          I can't... River...?
          She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of
          serenity to her, like she understands something now.

          SIMON

          (CONTINUING)
          River... I'm sorry...

          RIVER
          No. No.
          The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires
          again, but all the sound has bled out save these two.

          4

          SIMON
          I hate to... leave...

          RIVER
          You won't. You take care of me,
          Simon. You've always taken care
          of me.
          She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face
          an unearthly glow as she looks down at him.

          RIVER

          (CONTINUING)
          My turn.
          She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES
          through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
          the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
          lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
          Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
          the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
          back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of
          Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second
          her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her.
          The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
          over her.
          ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on
          Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes
          skittering over the edge into oblivion. There is a railing
          here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with
          a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him.
          They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
          knocking over tools and computer parts.
          The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
          gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
          Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
          He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
          inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
          screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
          point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing
          slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.

          116.
          Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides
          all the way through Mal's belly. Mal's eyes go wide.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You know what your sin is, Malcolm?

          MAL
          (shaky smile)
          Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven.
          He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so
          hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The
          Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
          screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it,
          gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck
          in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin.
          The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword
          still in his belly.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          But right now...
          He pulls the sword out, grimacing. Holds it over the
          Operative. The smile gone.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          vao I'm gonna have to go with Wrath.
          He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
          out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a
          second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and
          punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.

          INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING

          The gang is subdued -- because they are all of them injured
          and Simon is slipping away. Jayne looks at Zoe.

          JAYNE
          You suppose he got through? Think
          Mal got the word out?

          ZOE
          (almost convincingly)

          through.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal goes down hard, spitting up blood. He sees the sword,
          moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face. Picks him
          lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I'm sorry.
          The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
          into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
          with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain.
          The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword.
          Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          You should know there's no shame
          in this. You've done remarkable
          things. But you're fighting a war
          you've already lost.
          He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
          grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward --
          while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with
          staggering force.

          MAL
          Iwo Well, I'm known for that.
          The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back,
          unable to make a sound.
          Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
          through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
          arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
          hear his arms crack.
          Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his
          sword, saying:

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Piece a shrapnel tore up that
          nerve cluster my first tour. Had
          it moved.
          He squats down, looks the Operative in the face.

          Sorry 'bout the throat. Expect
          you'd wanna say your famous last
          MW words now. Just one trouble.
          He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the
          Operative's jacket through and shoves the sword through the
          fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          I ain't gonna kill you.
          He moves to the console, starts prepping it.

          MAL

          (CONTINUING)
          Hell, I'm gonna grant your
          greatest wish.
          He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life.

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm gonna show you a world without
          sin.
          He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
          V0 begins. Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
           the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
           There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
           street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as
           we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind.

          These are some of the first sites
          we scouted on Miranda. There is
          no one living on this planet.
          There is no one...
          Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
          side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back.
          On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror...

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

          CLOSE ON: A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION. Face full of
          fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate.
          And a small hand smashes that face so hard that teeth fly --
          the Reaver clearing frame to reveal:

          119.
          River.
          She is bloodied, but not killed. She's as she was in the
          bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can,
          ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are
          piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as
          she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
          everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
          above -- the mob.
          She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
          and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her.

          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          The Operative watches the end of the broadcast. We are on
          his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected
          on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr. Caron -- and her
          screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth.

          INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING

          The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
          the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his
          bleeding side.

          ZOE
          Sir?

          140 MAL
          It's done. Report?
          Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a
          report -- and the doors start to open behind her.
          Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
          as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
          reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
          blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
          We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
          completely away.
          Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
          wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
          soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...

          SOLDIER
          Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now!

          ANOTHER SOLDIER
          Do we engage? Do we engage?

          120.
          Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the
          soldiers, blades still gripped... A soldier levels his gun at
          her, sweaty and frantic... others still shouting...
          vp INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
          The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com:

          SOLDIER (O.S.)
          Targets are acquired! Do we have
          a kill order? Do we have an order?

          INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING


          CLOSE ON: THE SOLDIER'S FINGER, SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER...

          BLACK OUT.

          EXT. DESERT PLANET - SUNSET

          We are close on a gravestone. It is rounded, looks more like
          a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
          the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
          glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
          those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
          lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
          stone beneath.
          The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
          40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
          Book.
          The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
          The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
          a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
          instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
          to it is River.
          She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
          flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
          Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
          with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
          There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
          Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
          holding a burning taper.
          She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
          the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
          The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
          its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series
          of fireworks.

          40

          

          

          

          

          121.
          WIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads.
          We are close on another explosion when it becomes:
          CLOSE ON: A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks. Widen to see:

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY

          Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a
          replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash
          came through.

          INT. DUCT INSIDE SERENITY - DAY

          We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just
          above the engine room, replacing wires. Some of them run to
          a computer screen that she checks and adjusts.

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/TOP OF SERENITY - DAY

          Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it
          off the top of the ship.
          Close on Mal as he watches it go...

          WIDER ANGLE:

           EXT. REPAIR YARD - CONTINUING

          t f o And here we see the whole ship for the first time, harnessed
          by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all
          over. The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of
          repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly.

          INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY

          Kaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and
          crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely
          ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his
          head. A moment looking at him and she can't help herself -
          she slides her arms around his chest...

          EXT. SERENITY - DAY

          On a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with
          elegant precision.

          INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY

          Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work
          completely forgotten. With nothing resembling elegant
          precision, they sink out of frame to the floor.

          V0

          

          

          

          

          122.
          A beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above,
          looking down at them with detached curiosity.

          EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY

          It's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair
          equipment. The camera moves around him, skirting the ground
          of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground,
          standing watching him from some twenty feet away.
          Mal stops, doesn't turn. Hand near his gun.

          MAL
          If you're here to tell me we ain't
          finished... then we will be real
          quick.
          The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
          ship, framed by the rain behind.

          THE OPERATIVE
          Do you know what an uproar you've
          caused? Protests, riots -- cries
          for a recall of the entire
          Parliament.

          MAL

          (TURNING)
          We've seen the broadwaves.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You must be pleased.

          MAL
          'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be
          long 'fore she rolls right over
          and falls back asleep. Taint my
          worry.

          THE OPERATIVE
          I can't guarantee they won't come
          after you. The Parliament. They
          have a hundred men like me and
          they are not forgiving.

          MAL
          That don't bode especially well
          for you... giving the order to let
          us go, patching up our hurt...

          THE OPERATIVE
          I told them the Tams were no
          longer a threat -- damage done.

          THE OPERATIVE (cont'd)
          They might listen, but... I think
          they know I'm no longer their man.

          W MAL
          They take you down, I don't expect
          to grieve overmuch. Like to kill
          you myself, I see you again.

          THE OPERATIVE
          You won't. There is...
          (small, grim smile)
          .nothing left to see.
          Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head
          inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops
          to look up at the nose of the ship.
          ANGLE: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in the rain.

          THE OPERATIVE

          (CONTINUING)
          "Serenity". You lost everything
          in that battle. Everything you
          had, everything you were... how
          did you go on?
          Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as
          they slide together. Glances at the Operative, unimpressed.

          VAO

          MAL
          You still standing there when the
          engine starts, you never will
          figure it out.
          The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.

          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

          Mal stows the gear as Zoe approaches.

          MAL
          (to himself)
          What a whiner...

          ZOE
          Sir, we have a green light.
          Inspection's pos and we're clear
          for upthrust.

          MAL
          Think she'll hold together?

          ZOE
          She's tore up plenty. But she'll
          fly true.

          VW
          A beat between them before:

          MAL
          Make sure everything's secure.
          Could be bumpy.

          ZOE
          Always is.
          She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs.

          INT. FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING

          Mal comes in and runs into Inara. Jayne passes through as
          they talk, heading down into his bunk. Pays them no mind.
          Neither do Simon and Kaylee, in the dining room stowing
          supplies.

          MAL
          We're taking her out. Should be
          about a day's ride to get you back
          to your girls.

          INARA
          Right.

          VW

          MAL
          (moving past her)
          You ready to get off this heap and
          back to a civilized life?

          INARA
          I, uh...
          (he stops)
          I don't know.
          He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.

          MAL
          Good answer.
          He turns and heads into the bridge.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal eases himself into his seat. Takes a moment to adjust
          one of Wash's dashboard dinosaurs, then looks to his left.

          MAL
          You gonna ride shotgun, help me
          fly?
          V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the
          screens and buttons.

          RIVER
          That's the plan.

          MAL
          Think you can work out how to get
          her in the --
          She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship
          hums to life.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          Her engines fire up and tilt. She lifts gently off the
          ground.

          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

          Mal looks slightly, only slightly nonplussed.

          MAL
          Okay, clearly some aptitude for
          the... but it ain't all buttons
          A0 and charts, .
          You know what the first rule of
          flying is? Well, I suppose you
          do, since you already know what
          I'm about to say.

          RIVER
          I do. But I like to hear you say
          it.
          He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens,
          taking her up as he says:

          MAL
          Love. You can learn all the math
          in the 'verse, but you take a boat
          in the air you don't love, she'll
          shake you off just as sure as the
          turning of worlds. Love keeps her
          in the air when she oughta fall
          down, tells you she's hurting
          'fore she keens. Makes her a home.
          River also looks out at the sky.

        

          126.

          RIVER
          Storm's getting worse.

          MAL
          We'll pass through it soon enough.

          EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING

          As we shoot up with her through sheeting rain, towards the
          top of the sky.

          EXT. SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

          We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out
          of them, comes at us, flared by the sun behind the planet as
          she passes us, her Firefly effect lighting up, about to shoot
          off into the heavens --
          There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at
          camera, blacking out the frame.

          MAL (0. S . )
          What was that?

               A coast road. Date palms. Burnt-out hulks that once were 
               Russian T-54 TANKS have long ago been left to rust in the 
               sun. A 4-door MERCEDES hurtles down the ancient road.

               Shows that the car is fast approaching the point where the

               that we see the silenced muzzle of:

               COLT COMMANDO RIFLE

               Protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then:

               THE HERD OF SHEEP

               Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a 
               moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as 
               they clear frame, we can see that:

               THE MERCEDES

               Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered 
               and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the 
               bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance:

               WITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY

               One Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while 
               the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd 
               activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes 
               while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON 
               self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to 
               the Sheik's harness.

               AN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT

               Its "Whiskers" in the nose of the aircraft snag the cable 
               without slowing and roars off, the Sheik dangling unconscious 
               beneath -- just as the satchel charges EXPLODE the Mercedes.

               THE SATELLITE VIEW

               Records impassively for a moment, then breaks up into static.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Gotcha.

               IN A SAFE HOUSE -- SOMETIME LATER

               A pale, diminished Sheik sits at a steelcase table. A STEEL 
               COT and a STEEL TOILET. Closed-circuit cameras in the corner.

               Opposite him: the man, whose voice we have only heard: GENERAL 
               WILLIAM DEVEREAUX -- and though he wears a civilian suit, 
               his bearing betrays his pedigree. His considerable charm and 
               habitual skepticism are as much a product of self-discipline 
               as his close-order drill.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Nobody knows you're here. Not your 
                         people. Not even my President. You'll 
                         die here alone and be buried unknown -- 
                         barring some miracle.

               The SHEIK speaks a few words in Arabic.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         -- God? GOD?
                              (looks at him)
                         What you eat. Whether you eat. Sleep. 
                         Pain. Absence of pain. I decide. I 
                         make the day and the night. Even the 
                         way you got here -- a hand that 
                         reached down from the sky?
                              (looks at him)
                         God? I am your new God.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MOSQUE - DAWN

               A MUEZZIN climbs a spiral staircase, enters a turret-like 
               room, CLICKS ON a microphone and CHANTS the call to prayer.

                                     MUEZZIN
                         Allahuh Akbar...

               HUNDREDS OF BELIEVERS prostrate themselves on prayer rugs. 
               At the door, hundreds of SHOES are lined up, work boots, 
               expensive loafers, a range of social classes represented.

               ON THE STREET

               Shopkeepers pause to kneel and pray. In Arab homes, parents 
               and children do the same. And as we PULL BACK from:

               THE MINARET

               Of the Mosque, we DISCOVER not an Arab city, but instead the 
               unmistakable skyline of:

               DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN

               The World Trade Ctr, Wall Street, The Federal building.

               IN THE FBI SITUATION ROOM

               Two AGENTS hurry through the bullpen. TINA OSU, 32, sharp, 
               and FRANK HADDAD, Lebanese with an insouciant grin.

                                     TINA
                         Brooklyn South issued a code blue 
                         less than two minutes ago. They think 
                         hostages are involved.

                                     FRANK
                         Black-and-whites on the scene?

                                     TINA
                         Setting up a perimeter now.

                                     FRANK
                         Residence or business?

                                     TINA
                         A bus.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               THE 99 BUS -- SEEN FROM ABOVE

               Surrounded by a phalanx of Black-and-Whites.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

               They have been joined by Anthony Hubbard, the ASAC.

                                     HUB
                         SWAT?

                                     FRANK
                         On the way.

                                     HUB
                         Negotiator?

                                     TINA
                         Rolling.

                                     HUB
                         Bomb squad?

               THE 99 BUS

               The BOMB SQUAD approaches. We SEE terrified PASSENGERS inside.

               BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, EXITING THE FEDERAL BUILDING

                                     HUB
                         How soon can we get there --?

                                     FRANK
                         In this traffic, maybe tomorrow.

               BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS

               As a police TECHIE inserts a dentist's mirror through a 
               drilled hole in the bus's door, the L.E.D. begins to BLINK 
               and the passengers SCREAM and dive for cover. An EXPLOSION.

               BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR

               Frank is listening to a cell phone.

                                     FRANK
                         Oh, fuck. It just blew.

               BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS

               The doors hang off their hinges. As the PASSENGERS tumble 
               off, we SEE they are covered in BLUE PAINT.

               BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR

                                     HUB
                         -- What?!

                                     FRANK
                         -- That's what they're telling me.

                                     HUB
                         -- And nobody's hurt?

               Frank nods. Hubs closes his eyes in gratitude.

                                     HUB
                         Thank God.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE JOINT FBI/NYPD TERRORISM TASK FORCE - FEDERAL BLDG

               They're listening to a tape-recording, altered by a VO-CORDER:

                                     TAPED VOICE
                         -- our first and last warning.

               As the MESSAGE continues, we PAN the faces: MIKE JOHANNSON, 
               squad supervisor, and DANNY SUSSMAN, representing NYPD.

                                     TAPED VOICE
                         We expect our demand to be met. There 
                         will be no negotiation. That is all.

                                     TINA
                         Demand for what? You hear any demand?

                                     MIKE
                         You sure this is all they got?

                                     SUSSMAN
                         That's it.

                                     FRANK
                         Maybe it's performance art.

               Sussman shoots him a look. Clearly Haddad enjoys pushing his 
               buttons. Finally, Hub stands up.

                                     HUB
                         -- Okay. Blue paint. Voice-altering 
                         technology --

                                     FRANK
                         -- available from The Sharper Image 
                         catalogue.

                                     SUSSMAN
                         Last I looked they weren't offering 
                         exploding paint bombs.

                                     HUB
                         Still, the rhetoric sounds political. 
                         Militia?

                                     TINA
                         Not their style.

                                     HUB
                         Frank --?

                                     FRANK
                         Jihad isn't known for their sense of 
                         humor, and Hamas is raising so much 
                         money here, why queer their deal?

                                     TINA
                         Anyway, isn't Green the color of 
                         Islam, not blue?

                                     FRANK
                         -- And, excuse me, but why do we 
                         immediately assume they're Arabs?

                                     HUB
                         I want a composite of the suspects 
                         in circulation by the end of business 
                         today. Tina, you cross-check it 
                         against the mainframe. Mike, have 
                         you got the lab analysis on the paint?

                                     MIKE
                         Not yet...

                                     HUB
                         -- See if any was sold in quantity 
                         the last month. Danny --

               Tina's phone buzzes. She picks it up as Hub keeps going:

                                     HUB
                         -- find out what stop these guys got 
                         on the bus, maybe there's a witness.

                                     FRANK
                         Hub... I think we're all eager to 
                         give up our weekends on this. It 
                         just occurs to me, has anybody even 
                         committed a crime here? I mean, 
                         assault with a deadly color?

               Hub deals with Haddad's irreverence by ignoring it.

                                     HUB
                         Here's what I don't like. They know 
                         explosives. They know our response 
                         time. They put in a call and walk.

               A young agent, FRED DARIUS, hands Hub a piece of paper:

                                     FRED
                         Excuse me, sir. I think you should 
                         see this. Came in on the Fax.

               Only two words are written: "RELEASE HIM."

                                     HUB
                         Release him? Him who? Who are we 
                         holding?

                              (looks at the fax)
                         Why be coy about it?

                                     SUSSMAN
                         You think it's phony?

                                     TINA
                              (covering the phone)
                         Hub, somebody's flashing a government 
                         badge over at the warehouse where 
                         they're working on the bus. Our tech 
                         guys want to know if we're cooperating 
                         with any other agencies on this thing.

               Off Hub's look, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               AN OLD WAREHOUSE IN BROOKLYN - DUSK

               Hub and Haddad join AGENT FLOYD ROSE, a tall Black man.

                                     AGENT ROSE
                         -- She's looking for wiring signatures

                         to lift.

                         Smells like it. Turns out she's also 
                         been talking to some of the 
                         passengers.

               THEY OPEN THE DOOR

               In the klieg lights -- THE BUS. Men in white coats dust every 
               inch and generally behave as if investigating a crashed UFO. 
               In their midst, a young WOMAN, midwestern pretty in a serious 
               suit. She looks up as Hub enters.

                                     HUB
                         Hi.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hi, there.

                                     HUB
                         Special Agent Anthony Hubbard. FBI.

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, shit, I've been trying to liaise 
                         with you all day. My name is Elise 
                         Kraft, National Security Council.

               She offers her hand. Hub doesn't take it yet.

                                     HUB
                         -- And you've been trying to "liaise" 
                         with me all day? Did you think of 
                         trying the phone book, Elise? We 
                         have fourteen lines, that's not 
                         counting the unlisted ones.

                                     ELISE
                              (still holds out hand)
                         Hi, I'm Elise Kraft, National Security 
                         Council.

               Finally, he takes her hand. And doesn't let go.

                                     HUB
                         And I'm Colin Powell. What exactly 
                         do you people want with my bus.

               She tries to take her hand away, but he tightens his grip.

                                     ELISE
                         We're all on the same team here, 
                         Agent Hubbard.

                                     HUB
                         Who exactly is "we" on this particular 
                         team, Elise?

                                     ELISE
                         It's never the question that's 
                         indiscreet, only the answer.

               He smiles. She smiles back. Convinced she's charmed him.

                                     HUB
                         Tell you what, you send me an official 
                         inter-agency request for cooperation 
                         on this and I'll give you copies of 
                         everything we come up with. Otherwise, 
                         get your ass on out of here before 
                         you contaminate my crime scene any 
                         more than you already have.

                                     ELISE
                         There's no reason to be nasty.

                                     HUB
                         You think this is nasty?
                              (smiles)
                         In case you haven't heard. The CIA 
                         has no charter to operate 
                         domestically. Which puts you in 
                         violation of federal law.

                                     ELISE
                         Not according to the Cooperation 
                         Agreement, Special Order 12333 -- I 
                         suggest you reread the paragraph on 
                         sharing information. I happen to be 
                         well within my authority.

                                     HUB
                         Special Order 12333 refers to domestic 
                         terrorism. You got something you 
                         want to "share" with me?
                              (he waits... but no 
                              answer is forthcoming)

                         Unfortunately, not yet. But as soon 
                         as I do, I'll --

                              from her hands)
                         Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna 
                         have a couple my "teammates" here 
                         escort you back to wherever you came 
                         from. And then I'm gonna go back to 
                         the office and wait for that official 
                         cooperation request. Okay by you?

                                     ELISE
                         Swell.

                                     HUB
                         Nice meeting you, Elise. Is that 
                         Elise with an "E" or an "A"?

                                     ELISE
                         Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent 
                         Hubbard.

               OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE

               Hub watches as Elise is led away by two AGENTS. Agent Rose 
               stands nearby.

                                     HUB
                         Tail her.

               NICE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               In Frank Haddad's home. The Haddad's are celebrating the day 
               FRANK JR. has finished reading the Holy Koran.

                                     FRANK JR (O.S.)
                              (in Arabic)
                         "In the Name of Allah, the beneficent, 
                         the merciful. Say: I seek refuge in 
                         the Lord of Men, the King of Men."

               Frank's TEACHER offers the final benediction. Those who are 
               Muslim cover their face with their palms.

                                     TEACHER
                              (in Arabic)
                         "Make me know that which I have become 
                         ignorant of; and make me recite it 
                         in the hours of the night and the 
                         day; and make it an argument for me 
                         O Thou Sustainer of all the worlds!" 
                         Ameen!

                         Ameen.

               Later --

               The guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea.

                                     TINA
                         ...Nice, wasn't it?

                         Very.

                         You ever gonna stop by, pick up your 
                         things?

               Nearby, Mike and Danny observe them.

                                     DANNY
                         -- He doing her?

                                     MIKE
                         Some detective you are. They stopped.

                                     FRED
                         Really? I wonder if she likes white 
                         guys.

                         I wonder if she likes bald guys.

               Hub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife, NAJIBA.

                                     HUB
                         You must be so proud...

               And then Frank notices Hub's DRIVER standing in the doorway.

               INT. HUB'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

               Hub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank enters.

                                     FRANK
                         You sleep here?

                         Immigration called.

               A SMALL GREEN ROOM -- AS SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR

               Hub and Frank watch a dark-skinned MAN being questioned by a 
               uniformed OFFICIAL. An INS Supervisor shows them a false-
               bottomed suitcase stuffed with money.

                                     INS OFFICIAL
                         -- all in small bills. So we figure, 
                         smurf, right? Then I think, 
                         considering the gentleman's 
                         nationality, plus where he's been 
                         recently, we better call Frank.

                         -- who's trying to score points with

                         Has he broken any laws?

                         No, sir. He's twenty bucks under the

                         Not anymore.

               IN THE ROOM

               The official hopes volume breaks the language barrier.

                                     UNIFORMED OFFICIAL

                         an INHERITANCE? Somebody DIED and 
                         you're bringing them the MONEY?

               The dark-skinned man is trying to keep up:

                         -- And find me a judge I can work 
                         with. We want sound on this guy...

                              (raises his voice)
                         And bring us a radio.

                                     FRANK
                         I get reimbursed for this, right?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ATLANTIC AVENUE - BROOKLYN

               The Third World. Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut 
               meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow. Hand-written shop signs in Arabic 
               and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out "Oum Khatoum," the latest 
               neo-Palestinian techno-rock.

               KHALIL pays the taxi driver and starts off on foot. Hub's 
               CONTOUR pulls over a safe distance behind and waits. An AGENT 
               passes by and slips a WALKIE-TALKIE through the open window.

               MAN CARRYING GROCERIES

               Falls in behind Khalil, who ducks into a storefront, where 
               WE CAN SEE him buying a Coca Cola and a Baby Ruth bar.

               IN THE CONTOUR

                                     FRANK
                              (notes the purchase)
                         Twelve bucks in Gaza.

                         Fred's hovering. Patsy, take over...

               A WOMAN WITH A STROLLER replaces the man carrying groceries.

                                     HUB
                         ...Tell her to watch out for

                         I got the Judge.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         ...Good morning, Sir. How're things 
                         in the Second Circuit this morning...? 
                         ...I hear you... Listen, Judge, we're 
                         in a kind of situation here...

               KHALIL is on the move again.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Hold on, will ya, Judge?
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Is he talking to somebody, who's he 
                         talking to? Are we getting film?

               FROM A GREAT DISTANCE

               An AGENT with a TELEPHOTO snaps a picture of Khalil, who has 
               paused to chat with a PALESTINIAN of patrician good-looks.

                                     HUB
                              (covering the phone)
                         -- Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         Don't know him. If we were allowed 
                         to get sound on them, we'd know him.

               The walkie-talkie CRACKLES TO LIFE, confirming the photos.

                                     HUB

                         we're not... but we have reason to

                              (back to the phone)
                         Sorry, Judge... No... I just --

                                     FRANK
                         He's making him. Shit. Fuck. He's --

               Khalil has a sixth sense from a lifetime on the West Bank. 
               All of a sudden, he BREAKS INTO A RUN.

                                     HUB
                              (keys radio)
                         Go, go, go!!! All units --

               He slams the car into gear and PEELS OUT into traffic.

               SIX SURVEILLANCE TEAMS

               In various guises, break cover and SPRINT after Khalil, who 
               shifts into overdrive. Cars SCREECH to avoid flattening him.

               Hub's CONTOUR pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked 
               by a narrow passage between double-parked cars. He goes for 
               it, SCRAPING his way between them.

                                     FRANK
                         Christ!

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Judge, I'm gonna have to call you 
                         back...

               KHALIL SPRINTS

               Into an open-air MARKET, KNOCKING DOWN veiled WOMEN with 
               bags of fruit and vegetables. He VAULTS over stalls.

               The CONTOUR scrapes PARKED CARS as it swerves into an alley, 
               desperately trying to cut off Khalil's escape route.

                                     FRANK
                         Shit --! I didn't take the insurance.

               A SOCCER BALL bounces into Hub's peripheral vision, followed 
               by TWO BOYS.

               HUB SLAMS THE CONTOUR INTO THE WALL

               To avoid killing the two boys. Hub gets out of the car and 
               continues the pursuit on foot. He's gaining on Khalil, when:

               A VAN

               Bears down on Khalil, its doors sliding open as TWO PAIRS OF 
               HANDS reach out and ANOTHER MAN appears out of nowhere and 
               BODYCHECKS Khalil into the van and jumps in after him.

                                     HUB
                         What the --?

               The van BURNS RUBBER and DISAPPEARS into traffic.

               MINUTES LATER --

               An impromptu huddle in the alley. AGENTS gather in a circle 
               as RADIOS SQUELCH and HELICOPTERS circle above.

                                     FRED
                         They just found the van. Doesn't 
                         look like they're gonna find any 
                         prints.

               The Agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox-type 
               PHOTO from a digital printer in his car. Hub looks at the 
               picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian.

                                     HUB
                         Run him down, bring him in.

               Fred hands a cell phone to Hub.

                                     FRED
                         Floyd Rose.

                                     HUB
                         Go, Floyd.

               As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               AN ORDINARY HOUSE

               In an ordinary neighborhood. Hub sits in an UNMARKED CAR. 
               Agent Rose climbs into the front seat.

                                     AGENT ROSE
                         I've got two in the Plymouth, at 
                         least three inside, and see that guy 
                         walking his dog...? He did his 
                         business about an hour ago and they're 
                         still walking.

               IN ANOTHER CAR --

                                     DANNY
                         I had a dog like that once.

                                     FRANK
                         It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're 
                         spies.

                                     DANNY
                         The dog works for the CIA?

               Their radio CRACKLES to life. It's Hub.

                                     HUB (V.O.)
                              (over the radio)
                         All units report in turn.

               We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock."

                                     HUB
                         Let's roll.

               THE MAN WALKING THE DOG

               Is suddenly double-teamed by TWO AGENTS.

                                     AGENT - MIKE
                         Federal Agents. Hands behind your 
                         back --

               A third AGENT throws his jacket over the dog.

               TWO UNMARKED CARS

               Fishtail across the quiet street, boxing in the Plymouth as 
               an AGENT from the sidewalk thrusts a 12-gauge Remington Pump 
               in through the driver's window.

                                     AGENT - FRED
                         -- Keep 'em where we can see 'em, 
                         thank you very much.

               THE DOOR TO THE HOUSE

               Is BLOWN-IN by a specially-designed SHOTGUN. Two MEN, eating 
               take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn.

                                     FRANK
                         Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill.

               Hub continues warily from one empty room to the next. A 
               stairway leads downstairs. As Hub starts cautiously down, 
               muted VOICES can be heard. Reaching the bottom, he sees:

               KHALIL

               Sitting in a chair. Behind him stands one of FREELANCERS 
               from the warehouse. And opposite him, in a barca-lounger:

               ELISE KRAFT -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished 
               basement is a palpable feeling of menace.

               As Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock 
               .9 at his head. Hub just stares him down.

                                     ELISE
                         Ralph, spare us.

               The freelancer lowers the gun. Hub looks at Khalil, whose 
               face is badly bruised.

                                     ELISE
                         I never touched him.

                                     HUB
                         Really? I'm taking him into custody 
                         just the same.

                                     ELISE
                         What are you going to charge him 
                         with? Jaywalking?
                              (Hub stares at her)
                         I don't suppose we could just have a 
                         little chat with him here first?

                                     HUB
                         Not in this lifetime.

                                     ELISE
                         You know, Hub... may I call you Hub? 
                         If you guys hadn't blown the 
                         surveillance, we'd have been able to 
                         follow the money. What do you think, 
                         Khalil, you would have led us right 
                         to your friends, wouldn't you?

               Khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her.

                                     HUB
                         What friends --? What have you got 
                         for me, Elise?... Enlighten me.
                              (she stonewalls)
                         Tell me now or tell me downtown.

               Still nothing. Hub calls out to his agents.

                                     HUB
                         Get this guy out of here and book 
                         him.

               As the other agents approach Khalil:

                                     ELISE
                         One phone call and he's mine again. 
                         You know the number. I have --

                                     HUB

                         you have "the right to an attorney.

                                     ELISE
                              (overlapping him)
                         Oh, come on... Do you have any idea 
                         what you're starting here, the kind 
                         of shitstorm you're about to --

                         -- Kidnapping. Obstruction of Justice. 
                         Assault.

               As he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent.

                                     HUB
                         Cuff her.

               Elise sits, handcuffed, alone in the back seat. Up front, 
               Frank is driving with Hub beside him.

                                     FRANK
                         So, Elise... You okay back there, 
                         you don't get carsick or anything? 
                         Those handcuffs too tight --?

                                     ELISE
                         Shouf mountains, right? Shiite or 
                         Sunni?

                                     FRANK
                         Wow. You're really good.
                              (to Hub)
                         She's really good.

                                     HUB
                         You ready to tell us what's going on 
                         here, Elise --? Was the paintbomb a 
                         warning?

                                     ELISE
                              (to Haddad)
                         American University of Beirut? I was 
                         there from '79 to 82.

                                     FRANK
                              (a look to Hub)
                         No shit?

                                     ELISE
                         My father taught Economics. Henry 
                         Kraft?

                                     HUB
                         Is there a terrorist cell operating 
                         in this city that we are unaware of?

                                     ELISE
                              (ignoring him; to 
                              Haddad)
                         Such a tragedy. Growing up in that 
                         city was... paradise. Like an exotic 
                         Paris, wasn't it, Frank --?

                                     HUB
                         You ever been in Rikers, Elise? You 
                         know what happens in there?

               Elise looks at him, utterly unfazed by the threat.

                                     ELISE
                         ...Yum.

               Frank's BEEPER goes off. As they look at one another, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOUT A MILLION COP CARS

               Red lights flashing, have sealed off a Brooklyn Street. On 
               the rooftops SWAT teams are already deploying.

               SHARPSHOOTERS politely insinuate themselves into the 
               surrounding family APARTMENTS and take up firing POSITIONS.

               THE 87 BUS

               Stands alone in the middle of the street. Through a Marksman's 
               SCOPE we SEE the terrified passengers forced to stand, catch 
               glimpses of the TERRORISTS, obscured by the hostages.

               Hub confers with the NYPD officer-in-charge.

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         -- definitely Arab-types, only this 
                         time they're still in there...

                                     HUB
                         Any communication at all?

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         Nope. It's weird they're just in 
                         there.

                                     HUB
                         Get the frequency of the driver's 
                         radio and patch it through to this 
                         number. We need two lines. Frank, 
                         get a negotiator out here.

                                     NYPD OFFICER #2
                         Sir, they've got kids in there. We 
                         count six.

               This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well.

                                     HUB
                         That gives us something to work with.

               BACK AT THE CAR

               Elise leans forward as Hub opens the driver's door.

                                     ELISE
                         What's happening out there...

               Hub takes off his jacket, folds it carefully on the seat.

                                     ELISE
                         They've taken another bus, haven't 
                         they? Talk to me...

                                     HUB
                         Oh, now you want to talk. You want 
                         to be my friend, is that it?

                                     ELISE
                         Listen, these guys are the real deal.

                                     HUB
                         How do you know?

               She just looks at him.

                                     HUB
                         Is there a terrorist cell operating 
                         in Brooklyn?

                                     ELISE
                              (a long moment)
                         Yes.

                                     HUB
                         Was the blue paint a warning?

                                     ELISE
                         Yes. And I'm afraid this time they'll 
                         blow the bus.

                                     HUB
                         If they wanted to blow the bus then 
                         why haven't they blown the bus --?

                                     ELISE
                         I... don't know.

               He starts away.

                                     ELISE
                         Agent Hubbard. Please. Maybe I can 
                         help.

               A COMMAND POST

               Has been hastily improvised behind a SWAT van.

                                     FRANK
                         The driver's name is Larry Kaiser. 
                         He says they've got explosives 
                         strapped to their chests, they got 
                         automatic weapons, and they're 
                         speaking Arabic.

                                     HUB
                         Where the hell's the negotiator?

                                     FRANK
                         Tunnel's got twenty minute delays 
                         and they're working on both bridges.

                                     HUB
                              (to the cop)
                         What else did he say about the device? 
                         Did he describe it at all? Anything 
                         about a button, or a cord, or...

               THE FIRST ENG TRUCK

               Pulls up and raises its satellite dish.

                                     ELISE
                              (almost involuntary)
                         Oh, God.

               Frank turns to look at her. She is suddenly pale.

                                     ELISE
                              (as it dawns on her)
                         ...They're not here to negotiate.

                                     FRANK
                         Meaning?

                                     ELISE
                         They were waiting for the cameras.

               Hub is deep in conversation with the cops. Frank interrupts.

                                     FRANK
                         -- Hub...

               Hub looks up. Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she said.

                                     ELISE
                         They're want the newsies here. They 
                         want everybody watching.

               Hub and Frank look at each other. Can this be true?

                                     ELISE
                         You've got the shooters in place?

                                     FRANK
                         -- So?

                                     ELISE
                         Use 'em.

                                     HUB
                         What?

                                     ELISE
                         Kill 'em now.

               They just look at her.

                                     ELISE
                         It's lose-lose any way you play it... 
                         Do you want to lose little or lose 
                         big?

               The NYPD officer has been listening:

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         I got the marksmen on the com -- 
                         They're looking for a clean shot.

               As the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two more 
               NEWS VANS pull up. The MEDIA CIRCUS has come to town: 
               reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene reports. 
               Hub and Elise stare at one another.

                                     NYPD OFFICER
                         Shooter says they've got the 
                         passengers all standing in the aisles. 
                         He says, no go.

               Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes. As the seconds tick 
               away, TWO NEWS HELICOPTER jockey for position above.

                                     HUB
                              (to the cops)
                         We have rules of engagement we're 
                         gonna follow here, folks, so put the 
                         safeties back on your weapons.
                              (looks at Elise)
                         Nobody's killing anybody until we 
                         see what's what.

               He grabs the phone.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Larry, this is Agent Hubbard of the 
                         FBI, I'll be negotiating our way out 
                         of this. Let me talk to one of them... 
                         I know... I know. You just hang in 
                         there, Larry... No, don't worry, 
                         I've got somebody here who can 
                         translate.

               He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Sir, -- My name is Anthony Hubbard. 
                         I don't have any authority to make 
                         deals, or respond to demands. I just 
                         want to find out if you need anything 
                         in there? If any of the passengers 
                         are in need of medical attention?

               He waits as Frank translates. Hub covers the mouthpiece.

                                     HUB
                         -- Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         I don't know if they understand.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Sir, is there anything you want to 
                         say to me? That I can tell my people 
                         here?

                                     FRANK
                         The guy's just breathing into the 
                         phone, maybe they're not even Arabs.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         I get the feeling you don't want to 
                         talk, but will you listen --? 
                         ...Whatever grievance you have, 
                         whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn't 
                         involve these children --

               Still no response.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         So I'm gonna ask you to... please... 
                         let... the... children go.

               No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN

               And six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before the 
               doors HISS closed behind them. As Hub and a couple of the 
               cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children 
               cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAUSE 
               breaks out among the cops. Elise tries to hold back tears.

                                     FRANK
                         Okay, here we go...

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Thank you, sir. I appreciate that 
                         gesture, I really do. The best way 
                         to get what you want in these 
                         situations is to show yourself to be 
                         reasonable. As you've just done.
                              (Haddad translates)
                         Now we've got some more to talk 
                         about...

               Elise watches as the news cameras zoom in.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         I am unarmed, as you can see. So I 
                         propose... You let the rest of the 
                         passengers go, and I take their 
                         place... That way, there's no pizza 
                         deliveries or bathroom breaks to 
                         worry about -- and all these --
                              (indicates SWAT teams)
                         -- people... will disappear.

               Frank shakes his head, don't do this. Hub's look says 
               translate it. Frank does it. They all wait.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         I'm gonna take your silence to mean 
                         you're considering my offer --

               Elise looks at Frank, she can't help but admire his bravery.

                                     HUB
                         How about we just start with a few 
                         of the elderly people you got on 
                         there. It's got to be hard for the 
                         older folks to be standing all this 
                         time.

               Hub looks back at Frank. Still no response.

               AND THEN THE BUS DOORS HISS OPEN AGAIN. A few elderly 
               PASSENGERS start down the steps.

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Thank you, sir. Now let's just let 
                         these --

               THE EXPLOSION OF THE BUS

               Hurls Hub backwards as:

               ALL SOUND FADES OUT

               To be replaced by a high-end, almost electronic WHITE NOISE.

               SHRAPNEL

               Imbeds itself into car doors, bus benches, doorways as every 
               WINDOW in a three-block radius is SHATTERED...

               RED BLOOD

               Replaces blue paint in a horrific shower.

               HUB

               Fights for consciousness.

               AGENTS

               Rush to his side to see if he is alright -- but WE CANNOT 
               HEAR them. Though their mouths move it is only the WHITE 
               NOISE that overwhelms us -- as we realize that Hub has been 
               momentarily DEAFENED by the blast.

               When at last Hub manages to speak, his words are MUFFLED and 
               INDISTINCT -- as if the playback heads of a tape recorder 
               needed to be cleaned.

                                     HUB
                         I'm... alright. I'm --

               Frank Haddad bends down close and we can lip-read him saying, 
               "Just hang in there, buddy. . ."

                                     HUB
                         -- okay... Just let me --

               And then he leans over to VOMIT in the street.

               THE SOUND OF SIRENS

               Slowly bleeds in through the white noise -- mercifully for 
               us, and for Hub, who wipes his mouth and looks up, realizing 
               that his HEARING is coming back. He reaches for Frank's 
               outstretched hand and stands, albeit woozily.

                                     HUB
                         Is anybody --

               But the look in Frank's eyes says it all.

               THE DEVASTATION

               Is numbing. IMAGES we associate with other countries. And 
               then he sees Elise. Her face is cut and bleeding, but as 
               their eyes meet, her look is one of absolute compassion.

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

               MORE THAN A HUNDRED AGENTS

               Crowded into the now-overflowing BULLPEN. In absolute denial 
               of his physical condition, Hub paces like a caged animal.

                                     HUB
                         -- every trap, every hole. I want to 
                         rumble every mosque, every community 
                         center, every student organization 
                         that's ever said an unkind word. I 
                         want the heat turned up under all 
                         our assets, all our informers, every 
                         snitch gets twisted inside out. And 
                         put some money out on the street -- 
                         Arab community hates these people as 
                         much as we do. They'll help.
                              (turns to Mike)
                         Have you got positive ID on --

                                     MIKE
                         Hub, we don't have positive ID on 
                         anybody.

                                     HUB
                         We need more hands. Fred --

                                     FRED
                         I'm on it.

               He picks up a phone and begins requesting Agent transfers.

                                     HUB
                         I want to talk to Khalil.

                                     TINA
                         He's down the hall.

               Now she picks up a phone and adds to the cacophony.

                                     HUB
                         -- Conferences with DC at 9:00, 12:00, 
                         4:00 and 9:00. Call your families, 
                         find a sleeping bag, nobody leaves 
                         this office until we have a strand 
                         to pull. Oklahoma City, people. The 
                         first twenty-four hours are the only 
                         twenty-four hours.. And I don't want 
                         to see anybody walking.

               TEN MINUTES LATER - OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL

               Hub and Frank watch Khalil through a VIDEO MONITOR. The 
               bruises on Khalil's face have deepened.

                                     HUB
                         Doctor seen him?

                                     TINA
                         He's on his way up.

                                     HUB
                         Got a cigarette --?

                                     TINA
                         You don't smoke.

               Hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into:

               THE CELL

               Frank hangs back in the doorway. Hub pulls up a chair, turns 
               it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil.

                                     HUB
                         Ten thousand dollars.

               Frank translates. Khalil pretends not to understand.

                                     HUB
                         Khalil. I want to talk about the 
                         money.

               Again Frank translates. And again, Khalil looks blank.

                                     HUB
                         Okay...

               Hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack 
               of cigarettes. Khalil's eyes widen. Hub smiles at him. At 
               the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on 
               Khalil's forehead. Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette -- 
               drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. Khalil unconsciously 
               RECOILS in his chair.

                                     HUB
                              (to Frank, re: Khalil)
                         Doesn't like second hand smoke.

               Hub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his 
               cigarette. Khalil almost jumps out of his skin.

                                     HUB
                         You ready to talk about money?

               Frank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins 
               SPEED-RAPPING in Arabic.

                                     FRANK
                              (translating)
                         ...He says he loves America and only 
                         wanted to get away from the security 
                         services at home.

               Tears stream down Khalil's face. He kneels at Hub's feet.

                                     FRANK
                              (still translating)
                         ...He says he's sorry but he didn't 
                         know he was doing something bad. His 
                         cousin introduced him to a man who 
                         promised him two hundred dollars for 
                         his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase 
                         to an address in Brooklyn.
                              (to Hub)
                         He's a cut-out.

               OUTSIDE THE ROOM -- LATER

               Hub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes.

                                     HUB
                         Nasty habit.
                              (to Danny)
                         3830 Flatbush Avenue.

               FLASH CUT -- A SWAT TEAM

               Bursts into an empty apartment. On the floor, a fax machine 
               continuously sending the message: "RELEASE HIM."

               BACK TO -- HUB

                                     HUB
                         We want every rental agreement from 
                         every landlord in Brooklyn. Hotels, 
                         motels, flophouses...
                              (to the other agents)
                         It's cash, guys. They're the only 
                         ones in America using cash.

               TWO HOURS LATER --

               The room is dark. A TECHNICIAN operates an overhead PROJECTOR.

                         in Dhahran. As you can see, the 
                         signature is identical.

               Finally, he turns away so no one will see. His eyes are hot 
               with the emotion.

                         of Ramallah. That's the West Bank, 
                         not the West Side for those of you 
                         just joining us from Nebraska.

               A few appreciative CHUCKLES. They're all exhausted. This is 
               the first good news in a bitch of a day.

                                     TINA
                         Okay, we've pulled his landing card 
                         and his I-94. So now we know he came 
                         in three days ago, out of Frankfurt --

               She points to where: A TIME-LINE has been created out of 
               colored strips beneath a bank of silent TV monitors.

                                     TINA
                         What we need now is to fill in the 
                         time between his arrival and the 
                         incident. All known associations, 
                         and most of all, we need an address.

               TWO HOURS LATER --

               The TIME-LINE is progressing. PHONE TECHNICIANS add tie-lines, 
               dedicated fax lines, wats lines and scrambled lines. Cable 
               everywhere. Danny and Frank pore over Ali Waziri's I-94.

               Hub suddenly had to fight off a wave of nausea and dizziness.

                                     HUB
                         What time is it --?

                         When's the last time you ate?

               Fred Darius, the young agent, appears.

                                     FRED
                         Sir. They want you in the lab.

               Hub peers through the eyepiece at a MAGNIFIED STRAND of fiber.

                         -- It's what they use for funerals. 
                         The guy was wearing a shroud.

               He looks at Frank. It's just as Elise said. The real deal.

                                     HUB
                         Let's see if she's ready to talk.

               A HOLDING CELL

               Elise sits quietly with the stillness of those who have been 
               there before. Hub enters.

                                     HUB
                         I thought one phone call and you 
                         were out of here.

                                     ELISE
                         I didn't make the call.

                                     HUB
                         Why not?

               She just looks at him, entirely neutral.

                                     ELISE
                         Are you alright --?

                         Just some tinnitus in my left ear --

               They look across the professional chasm that divides them.

                         I need to know what I don't know.

                         Life's too short.

               But there's a hint of some thawing in her tone.

               Hub and Elise sit, eating corned beef sandwiches.

               She pauses, always gauging how much to reveal. And when.

                         In August, he went to Lebanon. Where 
                         he was... extracted.

                         We wait.

               She looks at him. For one brief moment the mask drops away.

                                     ELISE
                         If there's anybody on earth who knows

                         got to let it go. Those people were 
                         dead the minute they got on the bus.

               Frank Haddad appears, making his way toward their table.

                         Play him like a cop and haul him in

                         Tunis.

               Hub looks at Elise. Samir is leaving -- it's now or never.

               THREE AGENTS brace Samir politely but firmly, and lead him

               In the REARVIEW MIRROR, Hub watches as a look seems to pass 
               between them. Then again, it may not have happened.

                                     SAMIR
                         Who? I know no one by that name.

               Elise is looking out the window, seemingly oblivious.

                                     FRANK
                         You got him a student visa.

                                     SAMIR
                         I sign these applications as a matter 
                         of course, hundreds of them. Everyone 
                         wants to come to the land of 
                         opportunity and Baywatch.

               Elise tries to keep a smile off her face. Hub clocks this.

                                     FRANK
                         You spent two years in Israeli jails 
                         during the Intifada.

                                     SAMIR
                         The only ones who didn't were women 
                         like you.

               Frank BACKHANDS him across the mouth. Samir says something 
               in Arabic to Frank, who responds in kind.

                                     HUB
                         Frank --

                                     FRANK
                         Sorry. Family matter.
                              (to Samir)
                         You're going downtown, my friend.

                                     SAMIR
                         You cannot hold me. I know my rights. 
                         I watch American television.

                                     FRANK
                         Defrauding the INS is a Federal 
                         Offense.
                              (hands Samir to waiting 
                              agents)
                         Reservation for one, please.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CTF HEADQUARTERS - LATER

               They enter the BULLPEN. It's well past midnight. People are 
               sacked-out in sleeping bags while others continue working.

                                     ELISE
                         Club Fed.

               Frank leans over Danny Sussman, who has fallen asleep, face 
               down on his desk, and sings in a lovely brogue:

                                     FRANK
                              (singing)
                         "Oh, Danny-boy, the perps, the perps, 
                         are call-ing...
                              (as he awakens)
                         We need a search warrant on Samir...

                                     HUB
                         Frank, c'mere a sec. I want to show 
                         you something.

               He leads Frank into another CUBICLE. Perched on nearby desk, 
               Elise is dialing a phone, she stops to watch them:

                                     HUB
                              (quietly)
                         Frank, you ever hit a prisoner again 
                         I'll have your badge.

                                     FRANK
                         -- Someday I will tell you what those 
                         people did to my village in '71.

               Hub waits for him to calm down.

                                     HUB
                              (touches his arm)
                         Okay. But right now, act as if I'm 
                         capable of saying something funny... 
                         Now, let's go see about that warrant.

               As they walk back, Hub says to Danny:

                                     HUB
                         Find me a Judge who'll play ball 
                         this time. And set up a polygraph 
                         for Samir.

                                     ELISE
                         I still don't understand why we're 
                         tipping our hand with him --

                                     FRANK
                         What's there to tip?

                                     HUB
                         You're just trying to protect your 
                         asset.
                              (to Elise, pointedly:)
                         Aren't you, Elise --? He's your Joe, 
                         your asset. He's working for you, 
                         you're his case officer -- right?

               How should she respond? How thin should she slice it?

                                     ELISE
                         ...Sometimes... in addition to being 
                         a nationality, being a Palestinian 
                         is also a... profession. A lucrative 
                         one.

                                     HUB
                         Meaning, he's your Joe.

                                     ELISE
                         Mine. Yours. The Israelis. The Saudis. 
                         At one time or another, everybody in 
                         the Middle East has slept with 
                         everybody else.

                                     FRANK
                         So you're saying... you sleep around?

                                     ELISE
                         Only professionally.

                                     HUB
                         So we share him.

                                     ELISE
                         No.

                         start deportation proceedings.

                                     ELISE
                         I can't let you do that.

                                     HUB
                         Oh, you can't let me do that. What 
                         precisely is your involvement with 
                         these people.

                                     ELISE
                              (sighs, then:)
                         Samir's been a very important... 
                         project of mine for some time... I'm 
                         the only one he'll deal with. He's 
                         very well-connected -- and extremely 
                         high-strung.

                                     HUB
                         ...Call the judge.

                                     ELISE
                              (looks at Frank)
                         How easy is it to get inside, Frank? 
                         How good are your sources in the 
                         mosques? How many people you got in 
                         Hamas --?

               Franks shakes his head, ruefully. She's right.

                                     ELISE
                         No surveillance. I've seen your deft 
                         touch.

                                     HUB
                         Daily reports. We tap his phone.

                                     ELISE
                         And I get to see the transcripts.

                                     HUB
                         Fair enough.

                                     ELISE
                         And I run him.

                                     HUB
                         We share him.

                                     ELISE
                         He can't know we're talking.

                                     HUB
                         Then don't tell him.

                                     ELISE
                         Done.

                                     HUB
                              (to Frank)
                         Let him fly.
                              (back to her)
                         But we better start seeing product.

               She nods. A deal. For now.

                                     HUB
                         Any more surprises for me?

                                     ELISE
                         Not tonight.

                                     HUB
                         Then I'm going home to get some 
                         things.

                                     FRANK
                         I'll have somebody drive you.

                                     HUB
                         I'll grab a cab.

               And he's gone. Frank turns to Elise:

                                     FRANK
                         Elise. I'm really high strung, too.

               She just smiles and walks away.

               OUTSIDE THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

               Not many people around. Hub stands on the corner. A TAXI 
               cruises up. On duty. Available. He slows long enough to see 
               that Hub is black and passes right by.

               AT A RED LIGHT

               The taxi driver stops just long enough for Hub to slam his 
               SHIELD on the windshield.

               IN THE TAXI

               Hub sits in back, hurtling into the night. The driver's ID 
               identifies him as ABDUL HASSAM. Hub shakes his head.

               IN THE SHOWER

               As the hot SPRAY hits him, he runs his hands through his 
               hair and feels the BITS OF SHATTERED GLASS. Dried blood runs 
               off in rivulets from his hands. Not his own. He leans against 
               the shower wall, closes his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELISE -- BRUTALLY SLAPPED ACROSS THE FACE

               We are in her apartment. Samir looms over her.

                                     SAMIR
                         You let him HIT ME --!! You cannot 
                         care about me and let such things 
                         happen!

                                     ELISE
                         Next time don't be such a smart ass --

                                     SAMIR
                         Sometimes I hate you just because 
                         you are so American. It makes me 
                         want to hurt you. I think about 
                         fucking you and hurting you.

               Elise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the price 
               she's come to accept. In a heartbeat, it's all business.

                                     ELISE
                         -- You want to fuck me? Then work 
                         with me.

                                     SAMIR
                         Don't tell me what I have to do.

                                     ELISE
                         No? Do we really want to have this 
                         conversation again? Do we --?

               Something quietly ominous in her tone. He lowers his eyes. 
               And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack. Strokes his arm.

                                     ELISE
                         I need you to help me. I need you to 
                         be strong. As you have always been 
                         strong. For both of us. -- Samir? 
                         Look at me...

               BACK TO HUB -- WHO AWAKENS IN THE DARKNESS

               He's fallen asleep in a chair. In his lap is a pile of visa 
               applications. His BEEPER goes off. He rouses himself.

               BACK TO ELISE -- ROUGHLY TURNED OVER IN BED BY SAMIR

               Sex without any shred of tenderness. As Samir kisses the 
               back of her neck, we SEE in her eyes the thousand-yard stare.

               BACK TO HUB -- ON THE STREET

               In the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a 
               styrofoam cup of coffee. It's a ritual between them.

               BACK TO ELISE -- LYING IN BED AS SAMIR SMOKES

                                     SAMIR
                         -- Some people just cannot live in 
                         the camps. For my brother, it was 
                         already like dying. The only thing 
                         he lives for is movies.

               He sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette.

                                     SAMIR
                         -- And then some sheik tells him 
                         that, to die for Allah is beautiful. 
                         If he does this thing, our parents 
                         will be taken care of, and he will 
                         live on in Paradise with seventy 
                         virgins. Seventy.
                              (sighs)
                         And my brother, he needs to believe 
                         it very much, so he straps ten sticks 
                         of dynamite to his chest and goes to 
                         the movies...
                              (a rueful laugh)
                         And I become a VIP. It is very 
                         confusing.

                         -- So who are you afraid of betraying? 
                         You know these people. They bomb, 
                         they maim. Do they represent the 
                         Palestine you want to build?
                              (looks at him)
                         They're using you.

                         You are using me, too! Everybody 
                         uses the Palestinians! We are the 
                         whores of the Middle East!

                         I had to get special permission for 
                         that.

               As he stands up, naked, and goes to the window, we SEE:

               THE SAME IMAGE

               Seen again, FROM MUCH FARTHER AWAY by Hub who stands on a 
               ROOFTOP across the way, watching through 10×50 BINOCULARS. 
               Frank stands beside him.

               THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- NEXT MORNING

               Hub heads for his office, his SECRETARY nods inside. Someone 
               is waiting. It's Devereaux, in a civilian suit.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Hi. I understand they call you Hub.

                                     HUB
                         I know who you are, General.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                              (offering his hand)
                         Bill Devereaux.

                         82nd Airborne, I know. Same time I 
                         was running the --

                                     HUB

                         God. Duty. Honor. Country. Where on 
                         Capitol Hill, Wall Street, or 
                         Hollywood would you find one man 
                         who's even paused over one of those 
                         words in the last ten years?

               Hub is unsure why he's audience to such a command performance.

                                     HUB
                         What, uh, brings you here, General?... 
                         Can I get you some coffee?

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         You want me to get to the point. The 
                         President's concerned. He's worried 
                         that -- have you met him by any 
                         chance?

                                     HUB
                         No, sir, I haven't. I know -- reading 
                         the papers -- terrorism's a real 
                         concern for him. And your job is to --

                         -- With all the affection for the 
                         man I can tell you he doesn't know 
                         fuckall about terrorism, or the 
                         Mideast, that I don't put on his cue 
                         cards. What he's expert in is his 
                         own survival. You get my meaning?

                                     HUB
                         I didn't guess you came all this way 
                         for a cup of coffee.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Agent Hubbard -- you look like you

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Which is what I said to the President -- 
                         the Army is not some big green police 
                         department. Stick with the man on 
                         the ground.

                                     HUB
                         I appreciate your support.

                         You're sure you're not chasing your 
                         own tail, though?

               Hub considers for a moment, then:

                         Maybe not. We've received two 
                         communications -- from the bombers 
                         to "Release Him."

                         I know our stated policy is not to 
                         negotiate with terrorists, but --

                         Hub, we can't release him because we 
                         don't have him. We never had him. 
                         And besides that, he's dead.

                         I appreciate the heads up.

               Devereaux rises, offers his hand. As they shake, Elise sticks 
               her head in the door without knocking.

                         Sounds like I should get out of your

               JUDGE'S CHAMBERS -- DOWNTOWN

               Judge Frankel, 60, puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         -- You're telling me that just because 
                         some Brooklyn landlord tips you off 
                         that he's been paid in cash, you 
                         have the right to call in the cavalry --
                         ! Hub, as far as I know, paying cash 
                         is not yet a crime in this country.

                                     HUB
                         You're not hearing me. This Khalil 
                         was carrying cash for --

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         -- You've observed him giving cash 
                         to --

                                     HUB
                         ... No, but --

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         -- But you have hard evidence linking 
                         this apartment to the people that 
                         blew up bus 87 --?

               Elise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials.

                                     HUB
                         I know we'll turn up trace elements 
                         of semtex, chemicals... something.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         And when you do, you'll get your 
                         warrant.

                                     HUB
                         What about as a feasibility study?

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Meaning?

                         We enter first, take a look, then 
                         fill out the warrant.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Tell me the difference between that 
                         and breaking-and-entering?

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Not good enough.

                                     HUB
                         What is good enough, Judge? Another 
                         bus? A school, maybe. These things 
                         come in waves.

                                     JUDGE FRANKEL
                         Waves mean nothing to me; there's

                         by black people in this city for the 
                         past twenty years, but if you came 
                         to me with a plan to put all black 
                         people behind bars as a preventative 
                         measure I'd send you packing. There's 
                         a price to be paid for living in a 
                         free society --

               Hub catches Elise's eye -- "we're out of here."

               THE STAIRCASE OF A TENEMENT

               Elise and Hub climb seemingly endless FLIGHTS OF STAIRS.

                                     ELISE

                         Frank's working another warrant --

                                     ELISE
                         You don't understand, they're pros! 
                         From the age of twelve they've been

                         They've also got a warrant. A warrant 
                         from God. They're ready to die! And

                         were an American citizen. And these

                         Oh, really...?

               They reach the top of the stairs where Frank is waiting. He 
               dangles a piece of paper -- the warrant -- and grins.

               IN THE SAME SQUALID APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER

               Hub looks through the surveillance equipment focused on an 
               apartment across the street -- paper shades drawn. Wearing a 
               set of HEADPHONES, Elise listens intently to the Arabic 
               conversation.

                                     ELISE
                         They're discussing how hard it is to 
                         find a decent cup of coffee over 
                         here.
                              (hands headset to 
                              Frank)
                         I make out three voices. What do you 
                         have on the infrared?

                                     FRANK
                         Three sounds right. If we had 
                         microwave we'd know for sure. The 
                         CIA's got microwave, how come we 
                         don't have microwave.

               Hub, meanwhile is question a Syrian Landlord.

                                     LANDLORD
                         -- three of them. All day long they 
                         watch tv. And eat pizza. Nothing but 
                         pizza, pizza, pizza...

               Hub looks over at Frank. They've got a way in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DARK HALLWAY -- DAY

               Mike Johannson, carrying two PIZZAS, knocks on a door.

               IN THE SHADOWS BELOW

               Hub, Frank, and a small army of AGENTS lock and load.

               A YOUNG ARAB

               Opens the door to the length of a chain and hands Mike a 
               twenty-dollar bill.

                                     MIKE
                         You want change, right --?

                                     YOUNG ARAB
                         No.

                                     MIKE
                         You gonna open the door, or what --?

               The Arab motions, leave them on the ground.

                                     MIKE
                         Jesus, didn't ya hear crime's down 
                         seven-percent...

               Muttering, he sets the pizza down and heads downstairs. After 
               a moment we HEAR the chain pulled and the door open.

               IN THE APARTMENT

               The Young Arab sets the pizza on an orange crate. Two other 
               YOUNG ARABS in the next room barely take their eyes off the 
               rerun of "Hunter." But as the young Arab opens the box:

               A STUN GRENADE

               Hidden within, EXPLODES with a blinding FLASH, knocking him 
               to the ground.

               THE APARTMENT DOOR

               Is blown in as armed AGENTS rush in, Hub leading the way.

                                     FBI AGENTS
                              (English and Arabic)
                         FBI --! Lie down on the floor with 
                         your hands behind your back --!

               THE TWO OTHER YOUNG ARABS, HOWEVER --

               Have not been affected. Not only were they in the next room, 
               but also their eyes were averted from the FLASH.

               THEY COME UP FIRING

               But only get off half a clip each before they are CUT DOWN 
               by a fusillade of FBI return-fire.

               ON THE GROUND

               The Young Arab, momentarily disoriented, stumbles to his 
               feet, only to be confronted by six armed agents -- all aiming 
               at his chest.

                                     FRANK
                         Drop your weapon!

               The terrorist puts his gun to his mouth and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

               A STILLNESS

               As the CORDITE drifts lazily toward the ceiling, Hub calls 
               out from behind the table:

                                     HUB
                         What about the others? See if we can 
                         get a pulse --

               Other Agents scurry in to hover over the inert BODIES.

                                     FRED
                         Terminal.

                                     MIKE
                         Same here.

                                     ELISE
                              (softly)
                         Gone.

               Hub picks himself up in time to see Elise, kneeling beside 
               the body of the Young Arab, her hand on his boyish chest.

                                     MIKE
                         We got semtex, we got detcord, same 
                         stuff as the bus, the whole 
                         enchilada...

               A few WHOOPS and high-fives as the adrenaline rush of the 
               firefight abates. Frank opens the remaining box.

                                     FRANK
                         Anybody like anchovies --?

               Then from across the room, Hub kneels beside an ominous-
               looking DEVICE. A claymore mine.

                                     HUB
                         Goddamn it. GODDAMN IT.

                                     FRANK
                         What --?

                                     HUB
                         It didn't fire. They had it rigged 
                         to the door and it didn't fire.

               Frank stares at the lethal booby-trap. Hub shakes his head.

                                     HUB
                         We're too old to be lucky, Frank.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A DOWNTOWN BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT

               Where Mike and Tina are dancing their asses off. Around them, 
               other AGENTS from the takedown laugh and drink.

               AT A NEARBY TABLE

               Hub and Elise sit, watch them cut loose.

                                     ELISE

                         you with their suffering.

               A WAITRESS brings her another drink.

                                     HUB
                         You believe in anything, Elise --?

                                     ELISE
                         Like what, for instance?

                                     HUB
                         How about right and wrong?

                                     ELISE
                         It's easy to choose between right 
                         and wrong. What's hard is choosing 
                         the wrong that's more right. I just 
                         want to make it all... a little... 
                         better.
                              (finishes her drink)
                         Ignore me. I'm shitfaced.

               Frank appears to lean over their table.

                                     FRANK
                         So am I --! Hey, Elise... tell us 
                         about being a spook? Ever meet Aldrich 
                         Ames? Weren't you at the Bay of Pigs?

                                     ELISE
                         You were in charge of Waco, right --
                         ? Or was that Ruby Ridge?

                                     FRANK
                         The Shah of Iran, Noriega, I love 
                         the way you guys predicted the 
                         collapse of the Soviet Union.

                                     ELISE
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar 
                         Hoover wore a dress.

               She laughs and stands up to dance:

                                     ELISE
                         What do you say, Hub...? Peace?

               But as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on. They stand 
               there awkwardly. Finally, he takes her into his arms.

                                     ELISE
                         This feels like high school.

                                     HUB
                         -- only my prom date wasn't packing 
                         a gun.

                                     ELISE
                         Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours?

                                     HUB
                         Two inches. From the ground.
                              (laughing, they dance 
                              closer)
                         So what's the latest from Samir. I 
                         want a list of every visa he 
                         sponsored.

                                     ELISE
                         Not sure he'll do it.

                                     HUB
                         I once knew this undercover guy, 
                         started to care so much about his 
                         source --

                                     ELISE
                         -- Samir's a source. Period.

                                     HUB
                         Have you considered that he might 
                         also be in bed with the other side?

                                     ELISE
                         Samir in bed with them? That would 
                         too much to wish for.

                                     HUB
                         You're so confident.

                                     ELISE
                         Only in bed.

               Tina watches them. She rolls her eyes at Frank. And then:

               THE GROUND SHAKES

               A low RUMBLE as the light FLICKERS and the chandelier sways.

                                     FRANK
                         Whoa... What do they put in these 
                         drinks --?

                                     TINA
                         They got earthquakes in Manhattan?

               But Elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door. Hub 
               joins her. Already, in the distance, the WAILING OF SIRENS.

               IN THE TOWN CAR -- SPEEDING UPTOWN ON MADISON AVE

               Blue light FLASHING. Hub, Elise and Frank sit grimly silent.

               TRAFFIC

               Is snarled and gridlocked at 40th. Finally, they can take it 
               no longer and step out into a chorus of HONKING HORNS.

               THEY BEGIN TO RUN

               Past the frustrated drivers. Turning the corner at 41st where:

               SMOKE BILLOWS

               From the New Victory Theatre -- where a gala benefit is taking 
               place.

               GIRL IN A PRADA GOWN

               Walks toward CAMERA. She's stunning. From the jeweled 
               clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect, 
               except:

               HER RIGHT ARM IS MISSING

               And now we SEE:

               THE BLACK-AND-WHITES

               Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS 
               already unspooling their hoses. Cops, Firemen, EMT's. 
               Everybody's SCREAMING. Hub and Elise race past.

               MAN IN BLACK TIE

               Sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions.

               THE FEW SURVIVORS

               Their faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented. 
               As Hub and Elise continue toward a SOUND we have never heard 
               before in this country. A kind of keening.

               A NYPD SERGEANT is the senior OFFICER on the scene. Hub shows 
               his shield to the man who appears a bit shell-shocked.

                                     NYPD SERGEANT
                         -- fucking bastards waited 'til 
                         intermission. Everybody standing 
                         around... Oh, Jesus...

               GLASS crunching underfoot, they can only watch as horribly 
               disfigured BODIES are carried out. A NEWS REPORTER shoves a 
               microphone in Hub's face.

                                     NEWS REPORTER
                         Is it true the governor was attending 
                         tonight's benefit --?

                                     HUB
                         I don't know.

                                     NEWS REPORTER
                         Who it is I'm speaking to --?

               Hub ignores the reporter. He sees that Elise is already 
               tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a SOCIETY MATRON. 
               He takes off his coat and goes to work beside her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A DARKENED AIRPLANE

               Hub sits alone.

                                     PILOT (O.S.)
                         Folks, as you can probably tell, we 
                         have begun our descent into 
                         Washington's National airport.

               THE HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING SOUND IS HEARD AGAIN

               Hub reaches up to his DAMAGED EARS. As anyone who's ever 
               flown with a sinus problem knows, the pain is excruciating.

                                     STEWARDESS
                         -- You alright?

               But we can only LIP-READ her question. He's sweating now. 
               Over this, we HEAR:

                                     ARMY GENERAL (V.O.)
                         Either we answer this threat quickly 
                         and convincingly or next week there'll 
                         be a hundred more all over the world.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               ON CAPITOL HILL -- LATER THAT DAY

               As Hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome, the debate 
               continues within:

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.)
                         Sounds great, General, except why 
                         can't we find out who's behind it --
                         ?

               IN THE ROTUNDA LIBRARY

               A strategy session chaired by General Devereaux. Sleeves 
               rolled up, silver coffee service. Staff members abound.

                                     FBI DIRECTOR
                         These sects are organized so you 
                         need a kill to your credit to get 
                         inside. It makes undercover operations 
                         impossible. What that leaves us is... 
                         we're working on it.

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         How about who's behind who's behind 
                         this?

                                     CIA DIRECTOR
                         Libya. Iraq. Iran. Possibly Syria.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Ask a question. Get an atlas.

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         All I know is that we must respond.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Respond, sure. But how?

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         Find out who it is and bomb the shit 
                         out of them.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         And if we can't find out --?

               The question hangs in the air.

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
                         Look it keeps escalating. First a 
                         bus, then the theatre. What's next?

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         Anything but leadership.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         With all respect, Senator, why don't 
                         we just stipulate that the President 
                         is a dumb son of a bitch so we can 
                         all get down to business.

               An icebreaker. Everyone laughs.

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL (V.O.)
                         What about sending in the Guard?

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL (V.O.)
                         The National Guard are trained for 
                         riot control not counter-terrorism.

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         The Army then. I've seen the 
                         contingency plans.

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         It's settled legal doctrine, posse 
                         comitatus, that the Army not be turned 
                         against our own people.

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         Even if that's what our own people 
                         are asking for, three to one?

                                     SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
                         If the President is willing to declare 
                         a State of Emergency --

                                     SENATOR WRIGHT
                         President Lincoln declared martial 
                         law in 1862. He suspended --

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         -- which the Supreme Court later 
                         found un-constitutional. Ex parte 
                         Milligan.

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
                         And I've got an election in November. 
                         Ex-United States Congressman.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Guys, guys, the President lost a lot 
                         of friends last night --

                                     CONGRESSMAN MARSHALL
                         Not to mention six points in the 
                         polls.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         -- And his plane lands in two hours. 
                         We owe it to him to have a consensus.

                                     SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
                         You don't fight a junkyard dog with 
                         ASPCA rules. What you do is take the 
                         leash off your own, bigger, meaner 
                         dog.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         ...General?

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         The Army is a broadsword not a 
                         scalpel. You do not want us in an 
                         American city.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         But hypothetically... how long would 
                         it take you to --

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We only go if the President invokes 
                         the War Powers Act.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I understand that, General. Let us 
                         imagine, though, for a moment, that 
                         the order has been given.

               CLOSE on Devereaux. As he weighs his remarks, we FLASHCUT, 
               almost imperceptibly to:

               AN ANONYMOUS ROOM

               As WATER is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized 
               manner. O.S. we HEAR the SOUND of chanting.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM -- SAME TIME

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         ...Twelve hours after the President 
                         gives the word we can be on the 
                         ground. One light infantry division 
                         of ten thousand seven hundred men. 
                         Elements of the Rapid Deployment 
                         Force combined with Special Forces -- 
                         Delta. APC's, tanks, helicopters. 
                         And of course, the ubiquitous M-16A1 
                         assault rifle, a humble weapon until 
                         you see a man carrying one outside 
                         your local bowling alley or Seven-
                         Eleven. It will be noisy, it will be 
                         scary and it will not be mistaken 
                         for a VFW parade.

               BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS ROOM

               Where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. We watch 
               in SLOW-MOTION as it drifts down a shoulder.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         That means civilian casualties. At a 
                         minimum it's a drunk private joyriding 
                         in a Hummer who runs down an old 
                         lady in Greenpoint. At a maximum...
                              (sighs)
                         Make no mistake. We will hunt the 
                         enemy. We will find the enemy. And 
                         we will kill the enemy.

               BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS HANDS

               Turning the key in an ignition. An engine rumbles to life.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     DEVEREAUX
                              (looks at them)
                         And no card-carrying member of the 
                         ACLU is more deadset against it... 
                         than I am. Which is why I urge you... 
                         no, I implore you not to consider 
                         this option.

               A long beat. The Chief of Staff sighs.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I know what the President will say.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         What's that?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         That's exactly why you're the only 
                         man for the job.

               BACK TO -- A VAN

               Emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

               The Army General speaks up.

                                     ARMY GENERAL
                         I remind you General Devereaux does 
                         not speak for official Army policy. 
                         A police function has become accepted 
                         as our role in Haiti, in Somalia --

                                     HUB
                         -- Could I interrupt?

               Everyone looks over at Hub. Devereaux smiles.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         That's Anthony Hubbard, FBI. He's 
                         the ASAC on the ground up there. 
                         They took out the first cell less 
                         than 36 hours after bus 87. I suggest 
                         we hear what he has to say --

               He nods to Hub, who acknowledges the vote of confidence.

                                     HUB
                         There is something you probably 
                         haven't thought about doing?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         And that is --?

                                     HUB
                         Nothing. Don't over-react.
                              (off their incredulity)
                         With all respect, gentlemen, I'm 
                         just a cop. To you these people may 
                         be martyrs, but to me they're 
                         criminals. And a criminal is no more 
                         than somebody who thinks he's better 
                         than everyone else. And he's not 
                         better. He only has to be wrong once. 
                         And that's where we come in. We run 
                         down a tip from a landlord, or we 
                         pick up a latent print from a bus. 
                         Our phones are ringing off the hook 
                         with people from the Arab community 
                         wanting to help.

               He measures his words carefully. Unaccustomed to these kind 
               of august circumstances.

                                     HUB
                         They love this country and they hate 
                         that these criminals are giving them 
                         a bad name. With their help and some 
                         old-fashioned shoe leather, we'll 
                         nail these guys.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         -- Amen to that.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Thank you, Agent Hubbard. I, too, 
                         think we should proceed cautiously.
                              (looks around)
                         Now we've got an Agency briefing 
                         prepared... Some of you may not know 
                         Sharon Bridger. Sharon was posted in 
                         Iraq as part of our covert operations 
                         during the Gulf War. -- Sharon...

               CLOSE ON -- HUB as, from behind him, comes a familiar VOICE:

                                     ELISE
                         We all know the traditional model of 
                         a terrorist network. One cell 
                         controlling all others. Cut off the 
                         head and the body will wither.

               Hub looks to the back of the room at Elise, who's no longer 
               Elise. She looks blithely at Hub as if nothing is amiss.

                                     ELISE
                         Unfortunately the old wisdom no longer 
                         applies. The new paradigm is like 
                         the myth of the Hydra. Each cell 
                         exists independent of the other. Cut 
                         off one head and another rises up in 
                         its place.

               ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

               Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, keeping well below the speed 
               limit. In the distance, the glass towers of Manhattan.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     ELISE
                         Bus 87 was the work of Cell #1. Its 
                         elimination only activated the work 
                         of Cell #2 -- the theatre gala.

               FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

               Turns up Wall Street. Frank Haddad and Danny exit THE FEDERAL 
               BUILDING. They pass Mike and Fred, heading back in. Something 
               about the van causes Frank to take notice.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         And Cell #3? How do we find Cell #3?

               Everyone looks to Sharon/Elise. Hub looks at her, too.

               CLOSE ON -- SHARON/ELISE

               The question hangs in the air. She's thinking about something. 
               What?

               ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

               JUMPS THE CURB and heads across the plaza on A COLLISION 
               COURSE with the glass lobby of the FEDERAL BUILDING. Frank 
               and Danny are rooted to the ground.

               BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

               Close on Sharon/Elise. As time elongates. She knows.

                                     ELISE
                         We don't know.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               WHITE SCREEN (ALL SOUND OUT)

               Puffy clouds in a blue sky. As we TILT DOWN into:

               THE GUTTED RUIN

               Of what was once the Federal Building. RESCUE WORKERS hunt 
               for SURVIVORS as others carry BODY BAGS toward waiting 
               AMBULANCES. Hub stands sentinel to the grisly process as 
               indeed he has stood there all night. Frank is beside him.

                                     HUB
                         -- Are they confirmed?

                                     FRANK
                         Fred, Whitney, we're waiting on who 
                         else...

               A JEEP pulls up and Elise/Sharon gets out.

                                     HUB
                         Sharon.

               Their silence speaks volumes. With Sharon is an OFFICER.

                                     ELISE
                         This is Colonel Hardwick. Army 
                         Intelligence.

                         But 'til I hear otherwise this is 
                         still my show.

                                     COL. HARDWICK
                         I'm here as an advisor only. I intend 
                         to keep a low profile.

                                     HUB
                         I appreciate that, Colonel.

                                     COL. HARDWICK
                         I don't mean to be insensitive, but 
                         what, exactly, are your capabilities 
                         at this point? Your... infrastructure --

                                     HUB
                         You're standing on our infrastructure. 
                         Excuse me.

               Hub walks back toward the rubble. Sharon watches him go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HUB'S APARTMENT -- THAT NIGHT

               Sofas have been pushed against the wall. Hub's apartment now 
               serves as a temporary command post. Agents huddle together -- 
               poring over the charred or soggy remnants of files.

                                     FLOYD
                         -- They managed to get a partial 
                         VIN# off the van. DMV says it was 
                         reported stolen the day before in --

                                     HUB
                         -- Brooklyn.

                         Fiber thinks they've come up with a 
                         piece of the shroud. Egyptian cotton.

               Frank joins them.

                                     FRANK
                              (grim)
                         We just got a confirmation on Mike. 
                         He was with Fred in the lobby.

                                     HUB
                         How many does that make it --?

               A KNOCK on the door. They look at one another. One of the 
               agents answers it. Elise/Sharon. She walks over to them.

                                     ELISE
                         I'm... very sorry... about your 
                         friends.

                                     HUB
                              (giving her nothing)
                         Frank. This is Sharon.
                              (to her)
                         -- I didn't catch the last name.

                         ...Bridger. How ya doin' Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         Been better.

               She nods. Takes from her purse a folder, labeled in Hebrew.

                                     ELISE
                         The agency has come up with another 
                         list of probables.

               She takes out photos. Neither Hub nor Frank react. She puts 
               them on the coffee table. No one reaches for them.

                                     ELISE
                         I think we should circulate them.
                              (they stonewall her:)
                         Hey, this stuff may be good.

                                     HUB

               She looks at him, refusing to divulge anything more. Suddenly, 
               Hub grabs her arm and roughly shoves her into:

                         How can you possibly remember who 
                         you're fucking?

               She slaps him, hard. Without hesitation he slaps her back. 
               She claws at his face, but he grabs her wrist and bends her 
               arm behind her back.

               Something in the violence of the moment is more than a little 
               charged.

                                     HUB
                         I don't think we're there yet. It's 
                         also not going to stop these people.

                                     MAYORAL AA
                         What about protecting the Arab 
                         population? There's a lot of anger --

                         I represent the American-Arab Anti-
                         Discrimination Committee. Whatever 
                         injustices my people may be suffering 
                         at this difficult moment, we will 
                         continue to show our patriotism and 
                         our commitment to this country.

                                     HUB
                         Thank you, sir. And to everyone else 
                         for their patience today. These are 
                         extremely difficult times -- London, 
                         Paris, we're not the first city to 
                         have to deal with this.

               He pauses a moment, searching for the words.

                                     HUB
                         In Tel Aviv, the day after they blew 
                         up the market, the market was full.
                              (looks out at them)
                         This is New York. We can take it.

               And then two hundred BEEPERS all go off at once. Everyone 
               looks at one another. Dear God, what now...

               A GRAINY BLACK & WHITE VIDEO IMAGE

               Kids, huddled in a corner, crying. A dead mom. The legs of 
               what we imagine is the terrorist. We are in:

               AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

               Hub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast-
               barricade of desks and tables. Sharon kneels beside them.

                                     DANNY
                         -- one of the moms was carrying a 
                         piece, wounds the guy as he's planting 
                         the device. He kills her and locks 
                         them all in.
                              (points at video)
                         Up there in the corner... by the 
                         clock.

               The probe is a hot-head, "arthroscopic" video camera.

                                     DANNY
                         -- It's got a timer on it only we 
                         don't know how much time is left.

               As Hub stares at the horrifying image, the WHITE-NOISE returns 
               and begins to GROW in his head.

                                     HUB
                         Closer on the timer.

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         I'm trying but the angle's wrong...

               The NOISE in Hub's head continues to grow. And then suddenly 
               it is compounded by the SOUND of an APPROACHING CHOPPER -- 
               as an NYPD SWAT HELICOPTER lowers itself into view.

                                     FRANK
                         What the fuck is the NYPD doing here?!

                                     DANNY
                         I don't know. Somebody must have --

                                     FRANK
                         -- WE'VE RUN DRILLS ON THIS 
                         JURISDICTION BULLSHIT SINCE --

                                     DANNY
                         I KNOW --! YOU THINK I --

                                     HUB
                         QUIT BICKERING AND FIX IT!

               In the HELICOPTER -- a Marksman raises a sniper's rifle.

               THE WHITE NOISE

               Is screaming now in Hub's head. Unimaginable. Unbearable.

                                     DANNY
                              (on his radio)
                         NYPD SWAT, this is the FBI. Get that 
                         bird the fuck out of there!

               The SOUND of the CHOPPER and the WHITE NOISE drown him out.

               ON THE VIDEO MONITOR

               Children are SCREAMING without sound. Even the chopper is 
               drowned out by the WHITE NOISE.

               IN THE CHOPPER

               The MARKSMAN takes careful aim --

               IN THE CLASSROOM

               The TERRORIST grabs a child as a human shield. Hub closes 
               his eyes to the imminent nightmare, and then:

               SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING --

               He takes off, barreling down the hall, toward the locked 
               door of the classroom.

               THE DOOR SPLINTERS

               He flies through it, firing, hitting the TERRORIST twice.

               AN EXPLOSION

               Much like the first one on Bus 99. Hub throws himself over 
               several SCREAMING CHILDREN. And for a moment we don't know 
               if they'll live or die, until:

               BLUE PAINT covers them all. Agents pour in, followed by 
               Sharon. There, on the floor, holding as many weeping children 
               as he can:

               HUB

               Who, unable to keep up the facade for a single second more, 
               is also weeping now. Weeping for the victims of the bombings, 
               weeping for the children who've survived, weeping for himself.

               And for a moment, everyone just... stands there, vaguely 
               embarrassed, and more than a little moved.

               INT. HUB'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

               Hub sits in his boxers, toweling blue paint from his hair, 
               listening to the CNN report of the school attack. A KNOCK at 
               the door. He pulls on his pants. It's Sharon.

                                     ELISE
                         This just came in.

               She hands Hub another fax: "Last Warning. Release Him." He 
               looks at it and hands it back to her without a word.

                                     ELISE
                         You alright?

                                     HUB
                         My neck's a little stiff, that's 
                         all.

                                     ELISE
                              (a long look)
                         That's not what I meant.

                                     HUB
                         I know.

               They stand awkwardly in the doorway for a moment.

                                     HUB
                         You want a drink?

                                     ELISE
                         Sure.

               He walks over and opens a bottle of scotch.

                                     ELISE
                         That was a pretty crazy thing you 
                         did today.

               He doesn't respond. Hands her the drink.

                                     HUB
                         Better days.

               She takes a drink. Then another.

                                     ELISE
                         I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel 
                         like... being alone... tonight.

                                     HUB
                         Where's Samir?

                                     ELISE
                         I could call him. Maybe he'd join 
                         us.

                                     HUB
                         You'd like that.

                                     ELISE
                         I might. Or I could call Tina.

                                     HUB
                         555-6354.

               They stare at each other.

                                     ELISE
                         Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy 
                         recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but 
                         I did what I had to do.
                              (looks at him)
                         You know as well as I do, running an 
                         agent can be very... complicated.

                                     HUB
                         How about running an FBI agent?

                                     ELISE
                         You think I'm trying to run you?

                                     HUB
                              (looks at her)
                         ...Why else are you here?

                                     ELISE
                              (staring right back)
                         ...You know why I'm here.

               It's a charged moment. They're two sad and lonely people.

                                     ELISE
                         Tell me to leave.

                                     HUB
                         Leave.

                                     ELISE
                         No.

               When they embrace, their ferocity and desperation is something 
               more than comfort and less than love.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               The Chief of Staff is working late in a cardigan sweater. 
               Devereaux, in his impeccable suit, stands opposite him. Even 
               at ease he is smartly erect.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         The FBI received another fax.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Ahmed Bin Talal. They're still under 
                         the impression that we have him.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Do we? Have him?

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         To refresh your memory, as I told 
                         you last time, it was the Libyans 
                         who --

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I remember perfectly well what you 
                         said last time.
                              (looks at him)
                         Do we?

               Devereaux frosts him with a look.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Let me give you some free advice, 
                         son. Don't get between me and the 
                         President. You might break a nail.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I am speaking for the President.

               He and Devereaux look at each other. It is the moment of 
               plausible deniability.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         As far as the President is 
                         concerned... No, we do not.

               The Chief of Staff accepts the answer because it serves him, 
               for now. And because he has a more pressing agenda.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         General, do you know that after 
                         yesterday's attack, half the parents 
                         in this country kept their children 
                         out of school --?
                              (Devereaux nods)
                         ...They're attacking our way of life. 
                         It's got to stop. And the President 
                         cannot afford to be weak.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                              (reading the subtext)
                         Are you saying the President is 
                         prepared to take the necessary 
                         steps...?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I'm saying, the President is prepared 
                         to be... Presidential.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HUB'S APARTMENT - DAWN

               A ringing phone. Hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets. He looks 
               around and realizes he is alone. Did last night even happen?

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         Hubbard... What --? ...Slow down, 
                         slow down --

               He reaches for the remote control, turns on the TV.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GRINDING OF TREADS ON ASPHALT -- DAWN

               as THE FIRST APC enters Brooklyn. Followed by another. And 
               another. And in a sound bite: General Devereaux, IN FATIGUES 
               FOR THE FIRST TIME, and looking like grim death.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Today, with the invocation of the 
                         War Powers Act by the President, I 
                         am declaring a state of martial law 
                         in this city.

               THE BATTLE OF BROOKLYN HAS BEGUN

               Road blocks set up at select intersections. Random stop-and-
               frisk. Patrols of young soldiers in the streets. GANG KIDS, 
               same age, same color, eye them warily.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         To the best of our knowledge, we are 
                         opposed by no more than twenty of 
                         the enemy. He is hiding among a 
                         population of roughly two million.

               THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

               Is closed. SOLDIERS in full battle-dress stop cars, check 
               trunks, handbags, briefcases, and id's. THE LINE OF HONKING, 
               ANGRY MOTORISTS stretches as far as the eye can see.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Intelligence tells us he is most 
                         likely Arab-speaking, between the 
                         age of fourteen and thirty. Narrowing 
                         the target to fifteen thousand 
                         suspects.

               A SWARTHY TEENAGER is pulled from A CAR by a SERGEANT and 
               led away to a CAMOUFLAGED TENT set up on the bridge.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We can further reduce that number 
                         down to those who have been in this 
                         country less than six months. Now 
                         you have twenty hiding among two 
                         thousand.

               A CAR TRUNK is inspected. Two women waved through.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         If you are one of these twenty young 
                         men, you can hide among a population 
                         of similar ethnic background. 
                         Unfortunately for you, you can only 
                         hide there. And that population, in 
                         the classic immigration pattern, is 
                         concentrated. Right here in Brooklyn.

               Hub and Sharon stare at the Orwellian tableau.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         We intend to seal off this borough. 
                         And then we intend to squeeze it. 
                         This is the land of opportunity, 
                         gentlemen. The opportunity to turn 
                         yourselves in. After sundown tonight 
                         any young man fitting the profile I 
                         described who has not cooperated 
                         will be arrested and detained.

               Hub and Sharon show their ID's to an MP.

                                     MP
                         Would you follow me, please. The 
                         General is expecting you.

               He leads him to A CAMOUFLAGED TENT on the service roadway.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         There is historically nothing more 
                         corrosive to the morale of an army 
                         than policing its own citizens.

               IN THE TENT

               The swarthy teenager is being interrogated by COL. HARDWICK.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         But the enemy would be sadly mistaken 
                         if they were to doubt our resolve. 
                         They are now face to face with the 
                         most fearsome killing machine in the 
                         history of man. And I intend to use 
                         it. And be back on base in time for 
                         the play-offs... That is all.

               Devereaux sees Hub and strides over to him:

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Hub. Good to see you again.

                                     HUB
                         I can't say the same, sir. Not in 
                         that uniform. I thought you were 
                         against this.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         I am against it. It wasn't my call.

                                     HUB
                         "I'm only following orders" didn't 
                         work at Nuremberg. It may not be 
                         your policy but they're your tactics.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Your operation had its chance, Hub, 
                         and you couldn't get it done. You're 
                         down three touchdowns. Time to bring 
                         in the first string.

                                     HUB
                         Against our own team?

               Devereaux suddenly goes ice cold.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Are you questioning my patriotism?

                                     HUB
                         I'm questioning your judgement, yes, 
                         sir.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Hub, I want you to take a moment and 
                         reflect on my life as a soldier. I 
                         have a dozen tropical diseases I'll 
                         never entirely get rid of. I set off 
                         metal detectors with the shrapnel in 
                         my ass. I have watched men die and I 
                         have killed. Now I am serving my 
                         President and quite possibly not the 
                         best interests of my country, but my 
                         profession doesn't afford me the 
                         luxury of that distinction. I won't 
                         question your patriotism but don't 
                         you ever again question my command.

                                     HUB
                         I'm not under your command, General.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Take a good look around, my friend, 
                         and tell me that's still true.
                              (softening his tone)
                         But we're not shutting you out. In 
                         fact, I can't do it without you, 
                         Hub. I need men like you. Men willing 
                         to put it on the line like you did 
                         in that schoolroom.
                              (gestures to his 
                              uniform)
                         These stars mean I have been putting 
                         it on the line for thirty years... 
                         and never made a mistake worth 
                         remembering. Don't tell me I made a 
                         mistake about you.

               ON THE BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER

               Hub and Sharon exit the command tent.

                                     HUB
                              (ironic)
                         They're not shutting us out. They 
                         need men like me.

                                     ELISE
                         He'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick. 
                         You ever met anybody so in love with 
                         the sound of his own voice?

                                     HUB
                         We're putting Samir in play.

                                     ELISE
                         Now? With all this going on? He's 
                         freaked.

                                     HUB
                         Oh, right, he's high-strung. Only 
                         you can manage him. You and the CIA 
                         and the DIA and God-knows-who-else 
                         you're really working for --!
                              (seething)
                         Get back in there, Sharon, Elise, 
                         whatever the fuck your name is -- 
                         They'll probably make you a Colonel... 
                         if you're not one already.

               She gestures at the military leviathan.

                                     ELISE
                         All this... is no more in our interest 
                         than it is in yours, Hub.

                                     HUB
                         What, exactly, are your interests, 
                         Sharon? You protect Samir, you protect 
                         the agency. You're interested in 
                         protecting everything but your 
                         country.

                                     ELISE
                         You have no idea what I do for my 
                         country.

                                     HUB
                         No, and I don't want to know. With 
                         you or without you we're putting 
                         Samir in play. Now.

               She looks at him for a long moment. Considering:

                                     ELISE
                         One more lamb to the slaughter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HALF-OPENED DOOR OF AN APARTMENT

               Samir looks and sees Hub, standing beside Sharon.

                                     SAMIR
                         Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

               He tries to SLAM the door, but they force it open. He grabs

               A FAT JOINT from an ashtray and hurries into the bathroom.

                                     HUB
                              (to Sharon)
                         Does he understand the difference 
                         between the FBI and the DEA?

                                     ELISE
                         Samir... It's fine, he's cool.

               OUTSIDE, the sound of gunfire. Samir reappears, wild-eyed.

                                     SAMIR
                         Listen to that --! Are you listening? 
                         They're killing Arabs out there!

                                     HUB
                         You can stop it all right now.

                                     SAMIR
                         What are you talking about --? The 
                         army is here. They're setting up 
                         interrogation centers right now. 
                         They're torturing people in cellars.

                                     HUB
                         Let's just calm down for a second...

                                     SAMIR
                         -- I've got to get out of here. You 
                         have to help me --

               He goes over and peers out the drawn curtains.

                                     HUB
                              (gentling a horse)
                         We'll take care of you... don't worry. 
                         You just have to calm down --

                                     SAMIR
                         Money... I must have more money...

                                     HUB
                         -- You got a student visa for Ali 
                         Waziri. Because... somebody asked 
                         you to -- Didn't they --?

                                     SAMIR
                         I... got it myself.

               Sharon CRACKS him across the face.

                                     ELISE
                         Liar --!

               Now it's Samir's turn to taste the blood in his mouth.

                                     ELISE
                         You... tell him... what he wants to 
                         know.

                              (to Sharon)
                         Hey, that's enough.

                                     ELISE
                         He knows. He fucking knows.

                                     SAMIR
                         She's crazy. They're ghosts. Jinn. 
                         They'd never trust someone like me.

                                     ELISE
                         Stop simpering.

                                     SAMIR
                         Please...

                                     ELISE
                         I've got a picture of the two of us, 
                         do you remember that picture, Samir?
                              (the mask coming off:)
                         I'm going to post that picture in 
                         every mosque in Brooklyn. And then 
                         I'm gonna send copies to some friends 
                         of mine on the West Bank. You've got 
                         family there, don't you --?

               Hub jumps up, takes Sharon by the arm.

                                     ELISE
                         Let go of me --

               He gives her the BUM'S RUSH out of the apartment, shuts the 
               door, then turns back to Samir, who sits, ashen-faced.

                                     HUB
                         Now... Nobody's going to burn you, 
                         nobody's going to call anybody --
                              (sits beside him)
                         -- Who asked you to get that visa?

               Samir is trembling. Tears roll down his cheeks.

                                     HUB
                         Don't be afraid. I can protect you. 
                         There's nothing to be afraid of.

                                     SAMIR
                         I'm afraid of going to hell.

               Hub just sits there. He knows he's got him. Finally:

                                     SAMIR
                         His name is Tariq Husseini. He runs 
                         an auto shop.
                              (Hub waits for more --)
                         ...on Commerce Street in Red Hook.

                                     HUB
                              (hands him a card)
                         My beeper number. Anybody messes 
                         with you, I'm there in twenty minutes.

               He gets up and walks into:

               THE HALLWAY

               Where Sharon waits. As they head for the stairs we HEAR:

                                     ELISE (V.O.)
                         You're good.

                                     HUB (V.O.)
                         You're not so bad yourself.

               But we are HEARING IT along with:

               COL. HARDWICK

               In a nearby SURVEILLANCE VEHICLE -- where, through the newest 
               microwave technology (the kind the FBI don't yet have), he 
               has OVERHEARD the entire conversation.

               ON A NOTEPAD

               In his lap, the name, "Tariq Husseini."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUTSIDE SAMIR'S APARTMENT

               They are in a housing project. Hub dials his cell phone.

                                     ELISE
                         You calling Devereaux.

                                     HUB
                         Didn't get his number. Darn.
                              (on the phone)
                         Floyd, Hub. We need to put something 
                         together in a big-ass hurry... Where's 
                         Frank --?... Give him a 911.

               A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up beside them and armed soldiers 
               hop out. Sharon watches them as Hub continues:

                                     HUB
                              (on the phone)
                         -- and find some kind of beat-up 
                         car... Well, beat it up yourself if 
                         you have to... 896 Commerce St... 
                         it's a garage in Red Hook... but 
                         remember --
                              (looks at her)
                         -- they're pros.

               A PSY-OPS VAN passes by, broadcasting through a P.A.

                                     VAN LOUDSPEAKER
                         -- all persons without proper 
                         authorization must be off the street 
                         until seven a.m. Failure to comply 
                         will result in immediate arrest.

               The announcement is then repeated in Arabic.

               ROUNDING A CORNER

               They come upon several more YELLOW SCHOOL BUSES. From within 
               the various apartments the SHRILL PROTESTS of mothers and 
               sisters as YOUNG MEN fitting the "terrorist profile" are 
               hustled into the BUSES.

                                     HUB
                         Jesus...

                                     ELISE
                         Tariq will go to ground.

                                     HUB
                         We can hit him in less than an hour.

                                     ELISE
                              (turns to leave)
                         Hit him hard.

                                     HUB
                         Where are you going?

                                     ELISE
                         I've got to stash Samir someplace 
                         safe.
                              (as she goes)
                         Go with God.

               Hub hurries on toward his car, passing TEENAGE GIRLS, 
               defiantly wearing Keffiyahs, who mill about, taunting soldiers 
               with obscenities in English and Arabic.

               AN APC drives past, further inflaming their passions.

               Suddenly, A volley ROCKS AND BOTTLES come hurtling out of 
               nowhere, smashing harmlessly against the armor. The teenagers 
               laugh.

               And then, the sudden CONCUSSION of a small BLAST from UP THE 
               STREET. The teenagers SCREAM and scatter. Hub SPRINTS toward 
               A SMOKING CAR, pulling his weapon from his hip.

               A SOLDIER IS ROLLING ON THE GROUND, SCREAMING beside a PARKED 
               CAR. His leg is shredded. ARMORED JEEPS come squealing around 
               a corner. M-16's are locked, loaded and leveled at Hub.

                                     HUB
                         FBI --! FBI --!

               For a moment, it's touch-and-go as the the terrified RECRUITS, 
               just weeks out of basic training, decide whether to SHOOT. 
               On the ground, the injured soldier keeps SCREAMING.

                                     HUB
                         Now... I'm gonna... reach... into my 
                         jacket... and show you... my shield.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         Drop your weapon --!

               Hub drops the gun and shows his credentials. The young soldier 
               approaches warily as MEDICS attend to the wounded man.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         Sorry, Sir. Somebody's booby-trapping 
                         cars... We're all a little spooked.

               The RATTLE of small-arms fire is HEARD from up the street. 
               In the distance, a running FIGURE is chased by three SOLDIERS.

               The transformation is complete: Brooklyn as Gaza.

               REACHING HIS CAR

               Hub climbs in. On a nearby pock-marked wall, a single word, 
               "Intifada."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- LATER

               Hub, who sits in a beat-up old car, a baseball cap worn 
               backwards on his head. He keys his radio.

                                     HUB
                         All Units, report in turn. If talking 
                         will reveal your position, just key 
                         your walkie...

               AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- RED HOOK

               Inside, an AUTO GARAGE. Hoists, compression cylinders, 
               archwelders. Outside, two WINOS share a bottle by the curb. 
               A BEAT-UP DODGE drives up. In it, two scruffy-looking Black 
               MEN. Upon close inspection we realize that one is Hub. The 
               other is Floyd.

                                     HUB
                              (to a mechanic)
                         Yo...

               The mechanic looks out from under a car. He's Hispanic.

                                     MECHANIC
                         Que Pasa?

                                     HUB
                         Tariq around?

               The mechanic gestures to a partitioned-office in the back. 
               As Hub heads toward it, he checks out the other workers: a 
               teenager doing a compression check, another fixes a tire.

               IN THE OFFICE

               Tariq is on the phone talking in Arabic as Hub enters.

                                     HUB
                         Tariq?

               Tariq holds up a finger, hold on. Hub sits opposite him.

                                     TARIQ
                         How can I help you.

                                     HUB
                         You're Tariq Husseini?

                                     TARIQ
                         He's out.

                                     HUB
                         Damn. Do you think you could give 
                         him a message?

                                     TARIQ
                         Of course.

                                     HUB
                         Tell him the FBI is after him.

                                     TARIQ
                         You're joking.

                                     HUB
                         Very... slowly... put your hands on 
                         top of the table.

               Tariq notices that Hub's hands are out of sight beneath the 
               table. Hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an 
               audible CLICK. Tariq mutters a CURSE in Arabic.

                                     HUB
                         That wouldn't be a racist epithet, 
                         now would it? Stand up.

               As Tariq stands, Hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs, 
               pats him down, and cuffs him.

               MEANWHILE -- IN THE WAREHOUSE

               The two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun-wielding 
               FBI agents and are now ROUSTING the garage workers.

                                     HUB
                         Where are the others?

                                     TARIQ
                         What others?

               But before Hub can answer, an AMPLIFIED VOICE is heard.

                                     PSY-OPS (V.O.)
                         Tariq Husseini, this is the United 
                         States Army. You are surrounded.

               Hub is as surprised as Tariq.

                                     PSY-OPS
                         You have thirty seconds to throw out 
                         any weapons and exit the premises 
                         with your hands on top of your head.

               One of the agents with the shotgun calls out.

                                     SHOTGUN AGENT
                         -- Sir?

                                     HUB
                         Do as he says.

               As Hub hustles Tariq to his feet, the other agents start to 
               hustle the workers out of door, when:

               THE YOUNG MECHANIC

               Reaches into his overalls.

                                     SHOTGUN AGENT
                         FREEZE--!

               But when the Mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls, 
               all he is holding is the pin to a GRENADE.

               THE EXPLOSION

               Kills both the FBI agents and their prisoners. Hub throws 
               Tariq to the ground.

               FROM AN UPPER WINDOW

               An AUTOMATIC WEAPON opens fire on the Army presence.

               HIGH ABOVE -- IN A CHOPPER

               Devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Code blue.

               His order unleashes an overwhelming display of FIREPOWER.

               INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE

               Hub and Tariq crawl for cover as windows EXPLODE, walls are 
               SHREDDED, and incendiary TRACER rounds mix with solvents and 
               gasoline to start a conflagration. With the vaguely 
               hallucinatory quality of the S.L.A. shootout, WHITE NOISE 
               bleeds in and ALL SOUND FADES OUT:

               AN M-60 TANK (SILENT)

               Races in from around the corner, only to be hit by A ROCKET-
               PROPELLED GRENADE fired through the second floor window.

               INT. CHOPPER

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Code Red.

               TWO APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS (SILENT)

               Appear from their hiding place behind a nearby building. As 
               they dive into their attack trajectory --

               HUB (SILENT)

               Crawls, dragging Tariq toward the doors as:

               THE CHAIN GUN (SILENT)

               Of the Attack helicopter fires 2,000 rounds a minute -- 
               virtually UNZIPPING the warehouse -- softening it for THE 
               TWO HYDRA ROCKETS that reduce it instantly to a huge FIREBALL.

               IN THE CHOPPER -- DEVEREAUX

               Watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment.

               INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE -- TWO SHADOWY FIGURES

               Stagger, blinded, out of the inferno. Hub drags a half-
               conscious Tariq, where they are pounced on by commandos.

               THE STADIUM -- NIGHT

               Pac's and Tanks ring the stadium. An anti-terrorist perimeter 
               has been established -- concrete obstacles, sandbags and 
               razor-wire. Musco-lights cast their pitiless glow.

               OUTSIDE THE PERIMETER

               A mob of frightened parents, girlfriends, and furious fathers. 
               A LAWYER for the ACLU confronts a young Lieutenant.

               Hub shows his ID. Is allowed to enter into:

               THE DARK STADIUM TUNNEL

               A MUFFLED CRY that might or might not have come from someone 
               in pain. His footsteps ECHO as he walks out to where:

               2,000 DETAINEES

               All young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty are 
               milling about. Squatting, smoking, pacing, some laughing, 
               most looking terrified. All spread across:

               THE HALOGEN-LIT FOOTBALL FIELD

               Armed GUARDS backlit in the upper tiers. Enlisted men passing 
               out blankets and soup. Nearby, Hub sees Tina, standing quite 
               still -- Finally, she is able to speak.

                                     TINA
                         1942, my father was put into the 
                         camps at Manzanar. Until the end of 
                         the war. Two years. Now he roots for 
                         the Dodgers and swears it could never 
                         happen again.

               MOMENTS LATER -- ON THE FIELD

               Hub asks for Devereaux, is directed across the field, through 
               an aisle in the wire cages. FRANK HADDAD looms out of the 
               shadows. He looks terrible, drawn. Furious.

                                     FRANK
                         They got Frankie. My kid's here

                         How many times did I put it on the 
                         line, Hub --? How many times --

                         We're American citizens, twenty years.

                                     HUB
                         It's wrong, Frank. What can I say to 
                         you, but it's... all... terribly... 
                         horribly... wrong.
                              (takes his arm)
                         Now, come with me.

                                     FRANK
                         NO! I've got to find him. Besides, 
                         this is where I belong.
                              (takes out his wallet, 
                              hands over his badge)
                         Here. I'm not their sand nigger 
                         anymore.

               Hub watches as he he walks away. A MUEZZIN chants the call 
               to evening prayer. Frank drops to his knees and joins the 
               rest of the prisoners.

               THE LOCKER ROOM

                         And I said we will look into it.

                         You mean, like you're looking into 
                         me? Surveilling me? Breaking up my 
                         operations? If I'd known I was going 
                         to have to do your job for you I

               The two men stare at each other.

                         Tariq Husseini is my prisoner. I 
                         want to see him.

                         I want to see him.

               Devereaux just looks at him as we CUT TO:

               THE TILED SHOWER ROOM

               Tariq is strapped, NAKED, into a folding metal chair. His 
               head lolls on his chest, his eyes are dulled. On a nearby 
               table, an empty syringe. Two MP'S stand guard.

               Sharon is speaking softly to him in Arabic. Suddenly, Tarak 
               SPITS in her face. She wipes it off as if it is nothing.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         How long have you been at it?

                         Not long enough, apparently.

                         How much longer, do you think, before 
                         he gives up the other cells --

                         He can't give up the other cells if 
                         he doesn't know about them.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         He knows.

                                     HUB
                              (gestures to Sharon)
                         What about her briefing? The strategy 
                         session -- she said the cells don't 
                         know about each other, that they --

               Devereaux ignores him. Turns to Sharon.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         How long before he breaks?

                         At this rate. Too long. The theatre 
                         was hit nine hours after we took 
                         down the first cell.

                         So -- what other models do we have --
                         ?

               No one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain.

                         Shaking.

                         What about it, Sharon?

                         six hours.

               Hub stares at Sharon -- as the dark side of her professional 
               life is revealed.

                         We don't have thirty-six hours.

               Another silence. They're teetering on the edge of the abyss.

               Gen. Devereaux stares hard at Hub. And then:

                         I think we have to soundproof the 
                         room before we begin.

               Hub looks at Sharon, who looks away.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Escort him out.

               The two MPs lead Hub out of the room.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Let's get this over with.

               OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- HOURS LATER

               Sharon emerges from the shower room. She is shattered. The 
               blood drained from her face. As if carrying with her all the 
               sin that was committed in the next room.

               FROM INSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM

               The sound of a GUNSHOT. The door opens and Devereaux emerges, 
               in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie.

                                     ELISE
                         He knew nothing.

               Devereaux turns and walks off down the corridor.

               THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL

               Glorious, alabaster stone -- floodlit at night. A symbol of 
               all that is good and free and just. Hub drives a rental car, 
               staring out at the monuments.

               IN GEORGETOWN

               Hub pulls up to a lovely TOWNHOUSE. Parked on the street, an 
               UNMARKED CAR from the Secret Service.

               THE CHIEF OF STAFF

               Opens the door, wearing a Dartmouth lacrosse team t-shirt.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         C'mon in, we're still trying to get 
                         the last one down.

               In the background, we HEAR a three-year-old crying.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM - LATER

               Tasteful antiques, rag rugs and kids' toys.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         ...The President wants this shit 
                         over with. There's only one way to 
                         do that.
                              (looks at Hub)
                         Let the Sheik go.

                                     HUB
                         So we do have the Sheik?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         You think our government operates as 
                         a single coherent entity? Devereaux 
                         just... pushed the agenda.
                              (carefully)
                         Of course the President was completely 
                         unaware of it.

                                     HUB
                              (return of serve)
                         Of course.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Now we can't just let him go. America 
                         has to stand tall in the world yadda 
                         yadda yadda. So what we do is...
                              (the punch line)
                         We let the American justice system 
                         do its work.

               His wife appears, holding a squalling baby, looking defeated.

                                     WIFE
                         -- Honey...?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         I'll be right up, darling.

               She grits her teeth and goes upstairs.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         You have kids? They're great. 
                         Sometimes you just want to... drug 
                         them.

                                     HUB
                         What do you mean, let the justice 
                         system do its work.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         We don't release him. A judge releases 
                         him. You're an FBI man. That's what 
                         judges are good at, right?
                              (off Hub's look)
                         It's not like we've gone after him 
                         in proper prosectorial fashion. 
                         Kidnaping him. Holding him in 
                         isolation. "Fruit of the poisoned 
                         tree" -- remember that one from law 
                         school? Oh, we'll have a big trial. 
                         Everybody'll get their rocks off... 
                         But the fact is --
                              (the punch line)
                         -- the sheik will walk.

               He looks at Hub, shakes his head.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         ...And this whole episode becomes 
                         nothing more than the news cycle 
                         before the next news cycle.

               He hands Hub an ACCORDION FILE.

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Documentary evidence of Devereaux's 
                         whole operation.

                                     HUB
                         Why me?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Because you'll know what to do with 
                         it.

               Hub looks at the file in his hands. Considering.

                                     HUB
                         And what about her?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Who?

                                     HUB
                         You know who. How much is she 
                         complicit in all this?

                                     CHIEF OF STAFF
                         Ask her.

               Hub looks up. Sharon emerges from the hallway.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               ON THE STREETS OF GEORGETOWN -- LATER THAT NIGHT

               Hub and Sharon sit in silence in Hub's rental car:

                                     ELISE
                         I ran an Iraqi network for two years. 
                         Samir recruited them from among the 
                         Sheik's followers. I trained them in 
                         the North. Then we played them back 
                         into Baghdad, two, three at a time, 
                         hiding them in the mosques...

               Her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over.

                                     ELISE
                         It was gonna be beautiful.
                              (looks away)
                         -- And then there was a policy shift --

               She thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an 
               enormous well of untapped feeling. She fights it back:

                                     ELISE
                         -- The new doctrine was: Iran will 
                         be too powerful if Iraq falls apart.
                              (her voice trembles)
                         And it's not like... we sold them 
                         out. Exactly. We just... stopped... 
                         helping them. And I wasn't allowed 
                         to tell them what was coming down. I 
                         was ordered not to tell them.
                              (fighting back tears)
                         -- And they got slaughtered.

               She turns away.

                                     ELISE
                         You've got to understand -- these 
                         people... believe. Paradise. Bliss. 
                         To us they're just words. But to 
                         them... It's very beautiful, actually. 
                         And when you look at their lives, 
                         the heartbreak... And what do we do? 
                         We think, aha, we can take advantage 
                         of that.
                              (losing it)
                         So I quit. I came home. I just 
                         can't... do it... anymore.

               She doesn't want to reveal herself this way. Doesn't want to 
               be vulnerable. Doesn't want to cling to him. For a moment He 
               puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful, 
               dangerous predator.

                                     HUB
                         -- But first, you helped them.

               She senses the hardness in his tone. Looks up at him, and 
               through tears, puts her game face back on.

                                     ELISE
                         What do you mean --?

                                     HUB
                         They were being slaughtered. They 
                         needed to get out. But they were on 
                         the watch list. So you got them visas. 
                         You and Samir.

                                     ELISE
                         I promised we would take care of 
                         them. They were working... for us.

                                     HUB
                         Doing what, exactly?

                                     ELISE
                         I don't know what you mean.

                                     HUB
                         You said you trained them. Tradecraft. 
                         Subversion. That's what you said, 
                         right?
                              (she nods)
                         Only you left something out, didn't 
                         you... Didn't you, Sharon?
                              (she can't bring 
                              herself to look at 
                              him)
                         You taught them how to make bombs.

               The tears are streaming down her face now. Finally, she nods.

                                     HUB
                         -- And now they're here, doing what 
                         you taught 'em.

               The streetlight catches Sharon's face. Her eyes are haunted.

                                     ELISE
                         And I'm going to have to live with 
                         the hell of that for the rest of my 
                         life.

                              (handing out leaflets)
                         March on city hall. Today. No fear.

               Hub and Frank are standing outside Hub's car, each on opposite 
               sides, blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening 
               within.

               Sharon sits inside with Samir. She uses a SCALPEL to make 
               the slightest INCISION under Samir's arm. The RADIO plays.

                                     SAMIR
                         Ahhhhhh...

                                     ELISE
                         In case you decide to go on walkabout.

               Into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic TRANSMITTER.

                                     ELISE
                         How did you make contact?

                                     SAMIR
                         He is Afghani. Ahhhh. He got word to 
                         my uncle at the bath-house. You never 
                         met him.

                                     ELISE
                         But you're sure he'll show up.

                                     SAMIR
                              (trembling)
                         Sharon, they are all dead but the 
                         last cell and they are crazy with 
                         fear. Just tell me the message and I 
                         will pass it on.

                         I need to deliver it in person. 
                         Believe me, they'll want to hear 
                         what I have to say.

               She turns off the radio.

               OUTSIDE THE CAR

               Hub and Frank glance inconspicuously around.

                                     HUB
                         You watch the game?

               On a piece of paper he has scribbled, "Hit Hardwick. Safe 
               House. 11:00."

                                     FRANK
                              (nods yes, then:)
                         Kannell was really on.

               Hub then writes. "Bath-house. 12:00."

                                     FRANK
                              (nods again)
                         Think they'll make the play-offs?

               Hub looks at him. There's been little time for sentiment.

                                     HUB
                         How's your boy?

                                     FRANK
                         He's alright. Thanks for getting him 
                         out.

               Sharon steps out of the car. In her hands is a device 
               resembling a PORTABLE OSCILLOSCOPE. A green dot appears.

                                     ELISE
                         That's Samir.

                                     HUB
                              (looks in at Samir)
                         Green is about right.

               He slips Sharon the scribbled notes. As she looks at them:

                                     ELISE
                         He's terrified. Then again, so am I.

                                     HUB
                         You sure he'll go through with it?

                                     ELISE
                         If he doesn't he knows I'll give him 
                         to Devereaux.
                              (She mouths, "They 
                              out there?" Hub nods)
                         How's it feel to be on the other end 
                         of it?

                                     HUB
                         I like watching better.

                                     ELISE
                         This is the endgame, you understand 
                         that? If this goes wrong --

                                     HUB
                         Nothing's going wrong.

                                     ELISE
                         We're the CIA, something always goes 
                         wrong.

               The car door opens and Samir steps out, buttoning his shirt.

                                     ELISE
                         I don't suppose there's any way you 
                         would trust me to do this on my own?
                              (off his look)
                         I thought not. Well, in case it gets 
                         hairy, remember... the most committed 
                         wins.

               Hub watches as she and Samir walk away.

                                     FRANK
                         I trust her about as far as I can 
                         throw her.

                                     HUB
                         That far?

               SHARON AND SAMIR -- CONTINUOUS

               They hurry through the park. Samir is extremely agitated, 
               eyes constantly darting from right to left.

                                     SAMIR
                         This is not the way to the bath-house. 
                         You said to get a key from my uncle 
                         so that we --

                                     ELISE
                         Shhhhhh... If you'd stop whining 
                         you'd feel the surveillance.

               IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

               Colonel Hardwick, earphones on, overhearing them:

               A TRIANGULATED FIELD OF MICROPHONES

               On a nearby rooftop, an Army spotter uses a parabolic with a 
               gunsight. Another mic is in a woman's shopping bag; another 
               is in a twenty year-old's boom box.

                                     SAMIR (V.O.)
                              (trembling)
                         Sharon, please, I beg you. Do not 
                         make me do this. If they even dream 
                         we are being followed they will kill 
                         us.

               The light turns RED, they race across a crowded street.

               THROUGH AN ARAB NEIGHBORHOOD

               Where women in chadors carry mesh bags with tonight's meal.

               INTO A CLEAN APARTMENT

               Nothing but a single bed with a dirty white sheet. Sharon 
               enters and turns on the TV... loud.

                                     ELISE
                         Sit.
                              (takes out a pocket-
                              knife)
                         Raise your arm.

                                     SAMIR
                         What are you doing?

               She cuts the stitches under his armpit and begins to dig out 
               the transponder.

                                     ELISE
                         They cannot even dream we are being 
                         followed, isn't that what you said?

               Sharon very deliberately wipes her BLOODY HANDS on the WHITE 
               SHEETS.

               On TV, we SEE the MARCHERS in front of Brooklyn Borough hall.

                                     SPEAKER

               BOROUGH HALL

               THE CROWD is getting fired up as the SPEAKER exhorts them. 
               SOLDIERS watch uneasily, not certain how to respond as the 
               crowd begins to CHANT, "No Fear! No fear!"

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               THE APARTMENT

               Sharon goes to a closet and takes out some old clothes. She 
               TURNS OFF THE TV. Then:

                                     ELISE
                         Here. Put this on. We don't want our 
                         friends sweating too much while they 
                         wait.

               IN THE VAN

               Hardwick speaks into a handset.

                                     COL. HARDWICK
                         They're getting ready to move. Units 
                         1 and 2, on my signal --

               SUDDENLY -- THREE UNMARKED FBI CARS

               Seem to materialize out of nowhere -- boxing them in.

               ON THE STREET

               Undercover FEDERAL AGENTS roust Army CID agents. An FBI agent 
               with a deep drawl, spread-eagles one against a building:

                                     SOUTHERN FBI AGENT
                         Hi, there, I'm new in town. Can you 
                         direct me to Carnegie Hall, or should 
                         I just go fuck myself --

               The NYPD under the command of Danny Sussman -- roll up the 
               rest of the sound garden -- examine the parabolic microphones.

               AGENTS WIELDING SHOTGUNS

               Blow off the rear door of the surveillance van. Frank enters 
               and looks around at all the high-tech, microwave technology.

                                     FRANK
                         Ah, microwave.

               TWO WOMEN

               In chadors, faces VEILED, descend a back staircase. Only as 
               their faces emerge from the shadows and are caught by a dim 
               bulb do we recognize Sharon and Samir.

               Sharon unlocks a metal door to reveal THE HIDDEN COURTYARD 
               of a neighboring building. She and Samir hurry through a 
               back alley and out into an adjacent street.

               BOROUGH HALL (WAS SHOT AS 194)

               Where several APC's suddenly roar up and BLOCK off the square. 
               Devereaux stands nearby, watching as:

                                     LIEUTENANT #2
                              (though a bullhorn)
                         This is an unlawful gathering. You 
                         must disperse. I repeat --

               Soldiers in full RIOT GEAR emerge to form a battle line: 
               images of Selma, 1963; Chicago, 1968; Los Angeles, 1993.

                                     PROTEST SPEAKER
                         Join together! Join hands!

               THE MARCHERS LINK ARMS

               Arab clerics and Hassidic rabbis, Black civic leaders and 
               Hispanic gang members -- all continue to CHANT, "No fear!"

                                     THE YOUNG SOLDIERS
                         Nervously look at one another as the 
                         marchers begin to move.

                                     LIEUTENANT #2
                              (through a bullhorn)
                         These soldiers carry live ammunition. 
                         This is your final warning.

               "No Fear... No Fear..." Devereaux watches in dread as the 
               marchers close the gap on the battle-line of anxious soldiers 
               is this why he became a soldier?

               A YOUNG GIRL unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier. 
               Looks into his eyes. Smiles. And walks past. Another marcher 
               walks right past a soldier, who does nothing to stop her. 
               Soon, they are all surging past the riot-line.

               DEVEREAUX watches, as something is revealed to him, something 
               about America that, until this moment, he had forgotten.

               IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

               Frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at 
               Christmas. But something is wrong. Where once there were TWO 
               GHOSTLY IMAGES of Samir and Sharon in the apartment -- now 
               there is NOTHING.

               ON HUB'S OSCILLOSCOPE

               The RADIO-SIGNAL of Samir's transmitter still registers as 
               an unmoving, steadily blinking light. Hub is watching the 
               building. Frank steps out the van, his face pale.

                                     FRANK
                         We've got a problem.

               HUB AND FRANK

               Pound up the stairs of the building.

               THE DOOR TO THE CLEAN APARTMENT

               Bursts open. Hub comes in low and fast. Frank comes in hard 
               on his heels.

               In the center of the otherwise empty room, the white sheet, 
               SMEARED IN BLOOD, is draped over a chair.

                                     FRANK
                         What the --

               Hub stares in dread fascination.

                                     HUB
                         It's a shroud.

               And he's out the door in a heartbeat.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               BACK IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

               Frank and Hub listen to a playback of Sharon's conversation 
               with Samir on the digital recorders.

                                     ELISE
                         "...sweating too much while they 
                         wait."

               Frank looks up at Hub.

                                     HUB
                         First she turns off the tv, then she 
                         says it.

                                     FRANK
                         She knew we were listening.

               It hits them both at the same time.

                                     HUB
                         The hammam.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

               Hub and Frank hit the street at a dead run.

               BENEATH THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

               Samir opens a padlocked door with a key. He and Sharon 
               disappear within.

               A HAMMAM

               An Arab bath-house. Rays of sunlight play off the steaming 
               waters. Their footsteps ECHO off the tiled mosaic walls.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               IN THE BATHOUSE

               Samir kneels to touch the steaming water.

                                     ELISE
                         How soon are they coming?

                                     SAMIR
                         They'll be here.

               He starts taking off his clothes.

                                     ELISE
                         What are you doing --?

               He finishes disrobing.

               NAKED

               He steps into the bath. With a sponge he washes his body.

                                     SAMIR
                         What message do you have for them, 
                         Sharon?

                                     ELISE
                         I'll tell them when they're here.

               The DISTANT SOUND of the approaching MARCH echoes off the 
               tiled walls as Samir steps out of the purifying waters and 
               takes a towel from a hamper.

                                     ELISE
                         Nobody else is coming, is there?

                                     SAMIR
                         That's right.

               From the hamper he takes a Sig-Sauer .9 automatic.

                                     ELISE
                         You're the last cell.

                                     SAMIR
                         There will never be a last cell.
                              (racks the slide of 
                              the .9)
                         You should listen to the young men 
                         in that stadium. It is just beginning.

               Sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white 
               egyptian-cotton FUNERAL SHROUD and drops it over his head.

               THE MARCHERS

               Are streaming down the street.

               Hub and Frank desperately fight their way through a wild, 
               almost "carnival" feel.

               BACK TO -- THE BATHS

               Reflected in the purifying waters, Samir is putting civilian 
               clothes on over the shroud -- still holding the .9 on Sharon.

                                     ELISE
                         How could I have missed the play --

                                     SAMIR
                              (a forgiving gesture)
                         It was the money. You believe money 
                         is power. Belief is power.

                                     ELISE
                         -- Just tell me we didn't finance 
                         your operation...

                                     SAMIR
                              (a sad smile)
                         The world is a wheel. So... what 
                         message do you have for me, Sharon?

                                     ELISE
                         They're going to release him.

                                     SAMIR
                         Praise God. When will he be free --?

                                     ELISE
                         A few months at most. First, they 
                         have to bring him to trial, but --

               He turns away from her, opening the hamper.

                                     SAMIR
                              (not looking at her)
                         -- No.

                                     ELISE
                         -- But... that's what you want, isn't 
                         it? Why you've done all this --

               BELT OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVES

               Comes next. Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest.

                                     SAMIR
                         No. It's not.

               He comes to stand beside her.

                                     SAMIR
                         I want you to bleed... as we have 
                         bled.

                                     ELISE
                         Samir, the Koran preaches --

                                     SAMIR
                         Do not speak to me of the Koran, 
                         woman.
                              (fighting his emotion)
                         You take our leader. A holy man. You 
                         put him in prison for preaching the 
                         word of God. You must learn the 
                         consequences of trying to tell the 
                         world how to live.

                                     ELISE
                              (with rising terror)
                         But it's over, your point's been 
                         made, why spill any more blood? Those 
                         poor people out there in the street, 
                         they're fucking marching for your 
                         cause...

                                     SAMIR
                         Yes.
                              (fastens the last 
                              strap on his semtex 
                              harness)
                         And they, too, will become its 
                         martyrs.

               A VOICE from the top of the stairs:

                                     HUB (V.O.)
                         Let her go and you'll live.

               Samir looks up, sees Hub aiming his .45. But Sharon is between 
               them, blocking his shot.

               From outside, we HEAR the sound of the marchers' CHANTING, 
               "No Fear...! No Fear...!" Samir HEARS it, too.

                                     SAMIR
                         Move away from the door.

                                     ELISE
                         NO --!!!

                                     HUB
                         Let her go and you'll live --

                                     ELISE
                         DON'T --!!!!

                                     SAMIR
                              (screaming, panicked)
                         GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR --!!!

                                     HUB
                         SAMIR --!

                                     SAMIR
                         YOU WANT TO DIE --!!

               They're all SCREAMING at once. Still Samir keeps inching 
               toward the stairs. Hub blocks the way.

                                     HUB
                         No way you're going out there.

               Samir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs.

                                     SAMIR
                         MOVE AWAY --!

               Sharon's eyes meet Hubs'.

                                     ELISE
                         Shoot.

                                     HUB
                         Shut up.

                                     ELISE
                         Shoot.

                                     HUB
                         SHUT UP...

               Samir is edging ever closer. Starting up the stairs. Sharon's 
               eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption.

                                     ELISE
                         SHOOT ME --!!!

                                     HUB
                         I... CAN'T --!

                                     ELISE
                         YOU HAVE TO.
                              (weeping now)
                         You... promised...

               Hub's finger tightens on the trigger. But then slowly, almost 
               imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun.

                                     ELISE
                              (sobbing)
                         No --!!!

                                     SAMIR
                         It is God's will.

               His left hand moves imperceptibly toward the RIPCORD of the 
               explosive device.

                                     HUB
                         If there is a God, he weeps at the 
                         crimes we commit in his name.

               HIS FIRST SHOT

               Rips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards.

               HIS SECOND SHOT

               Is to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord.

               THE THIRD SHOT

               Is a killing headshot. Rolling him into the baths.

               CLOUD OF BLOOD

               Blooms in the cleansing water. The funeral shroud billows.

               THE ECHO OF THE SHOTS

               Still rings in the tiled room as Hub kneels beside Sharon.

                                     HUB
                              (on radio)
                         Officer down. OFFICER DOWN --!

                                     ELISE
                         Is... he... dead?

                                     HUB
                         ...Shhhhhhh...

                                     ELISE
                              (whispers)
                         ...no... regrets...

               Hub cradles her head.

                                     HUB
                         You... knew.

                                     ELISE
                              (the saddest smile)
                         I... wondered.

               FRANK HADDAD

               Appears at the top of the steps. Behind him, two PARAMEDICS 
               race down to kneel beside Sharon. Hub is pushed aside as 
               they begin triage -- but it doesn't look good as suddenly, 
               she begins to convulse.

                                     HUB
                         Sharon... SHARON --

                                     ELISE
                         ... Emma... My name... is Emma.

               And then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and 
               then more clearly. We realize she's speaking Arabic.

                                     HUB
                         -- what are you? I don't...

               And then Frank is standing above them. Tears in his eyes.

                                     FRANK
                              (translating)
                         "I... seek refuge... king of kings..."

               And Hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own 
               death. He holds her as she continues to pray in and out of 
               her two native tongues. Until, at last:

                                     SHARON/EMMA
                              (whispers)
                         Allah Ahkbar. God is great --

                                     FRANK
                         Allah Ahkbar --

                                     HUB
                         Amen.

               And she's gone.

               OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER

               A block away, we can see the Marchers pass by. The chant of 
               "No Fear..." fades into the distance. But Hub has already 
               turned his back and is hurrying away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

               Hub hurries toward the Courthouse.

               MOMENTS LATER - IN THE COURTHOUSE

               JUDGE FRANKEL opens the door. He is taken aback by the blood 
               on Hub's clothes.

                                     HUB
                         I want to talk about a free society.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               THE STADIUM COMMAND POST

               Where Devereaux is watching coverage of the march.

                                     TV SOUND BITE (V.O.)
                         -- "a very moving moment in which 
                         the people of a city step forward to 
                         declare their courage and solidarity --

               He looks up to see Hub. He's carrying the ACCORDION FILE 
               that the Chief of Staff gave him.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell 
                         me exactly what you mean detaining 
                         Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID 
                         staff. Because that strikes me as a 
                         very peculiar idea of interagency 
                         liaison.

                                     HUB
                         The last cell has been taken down. 
                         It was Samir. I took him out.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         What makes you so sure he was the 
                         last cell?

                                     HUB
                         Sharon.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Sharon is not trustworthy.

                                     HUB
                         Sharon is dead. She gave her life.
                              (takes a piece of 
                              paper from his pocket)
                         This is a writ from the US District 
                         Court releasing all those being held 
                         here without habeus corpus.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         My authority supersedes the civilian 
                         judiciary under the decree of martial 
                         law.
                              (a rueful smile)
                         Sorry.

                                     HUB
                         Your authority ends now. It's all 
                         over.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         What's over.

                                     HUB
                              (looks at him)
                         They're going to release him.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Release him?

                                     HUB
                         The Sheik.
                              (holds up the Chief 
                              of Staff's' file)
                         Clear violation of international 
                         law, Congressional oversight statutes, 
                         a couple of treaties, the Federal 
                         perjury statute, and my favorite, 
                         the Logan Act, for conducting your 
                         own personal foreign policy.
                              (simply)
                         I know the whole story, General.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         You don't know shit. Poor suffering 
                         Sharon and her poor suffering people. 
                         It's called "going native" -- the 
                         most elementary error of an 
                         intelligence operative and she made 
                         it. She had all of you working for 
                         her and she was working for them 
                         without even knowing it. And now 
                         they're getting exactly what they 
                         want, which is the Sheik will be 
                         back in the mix. But ten times as 
                         strong, because now he's the big man 
                         who stood up to the Americans.
                              (looks at Hub)
                         I did what was necessary. I make no 
                         apologies. If you think you're going 
                         to be able to use that file against 
                         me, you know even less about politics 
                         than I imagined.

                                     HUB
                         General. I'm not in politics. You 
                         can have this back. I won't use it.

               Hub hands him the file. Devereaux takes it.

                                     DEVEREAUX
                         Because you don't have the balls.
                              (off Hub's look)
                         Did you expect me to get all weepy 
                         with gratitude? You serve your 
                         country.
                              (dismissively)
                         Is there anything else?

               Hub would love to just... clock him. Instead:

                                     HUB
                         I said I wasn't in politics. I'm 
                         not. I'm in law enforcement.

               He takes his gun from its shoulder holster.

                                     HUB
                         William Devereaux, you are under 
                         arrest for the torture and murder of 
                         Tariq Husseini under color of 
                         authority, United States Code Title 
                         42, Chapter 21, Subchapter 1, Sections 
                         1983.
                              (takes out his gun)
                         Surrender your weapon.

               Behind them, a COMMOTION as Frank and several agents force 
               their way into the room, followed by REPORTERS, who shout 
               questions as STROBES and VIDEOTAPE record the arrest.

               OUTSIDE THE STADIUM

               An NYPD car -- Devereaux within, pulls away, lights flashing.

               HUNDREDS OF YOUNG ARAB BOYS

               Emerge from tunnel and into the waiting arms of their mothers, 
               the tearful smiles of their wives and children. Hub and Frank 
               stand there, watching the reunions.

                                     FRANK
                              (after a moment)
                         Did we win or did we lose --?

               Hub has no answer. No one has the answer.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15
     WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until
     finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK

     The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
     just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
     water runs down its face and body.

     TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
     baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
     her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
     baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:

                                 MIDWIFE
                He is strong.

     The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out
     to the new MOTHER:

     AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
     divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
     takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
     She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:

                                 AMANDA
                ... hello.

     CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
     She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:

                              YOUNGER MIDWIFE
                The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?

                              MIDWIFE
                        (a beat; then)
                She is human.

     A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
     into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
     that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.

                                 MIDWIFE (CONT'D)
                Sarek arrives.

     The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
     a moment, clearly disquieted.




15A   OMIT                                                              15A

15B   EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK [FORMER SC. 14]                      15B

      A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities
      constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
      mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the
      horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built
      seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.

      A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

      The speeder parks outside the home --

15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C

      SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
      rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
      looks at the child -- his child -- and says:

                                  SAREK
                 Well done.

      She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
      enough rancor:

                                  AMANDA
                 Thanks.

      He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --

                               SAREK
                 Your tone suggests disappointment. The
                 Science Council required my presence for
                 a session regarding--

                                  AMANDA
                 Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you
                 here.

      The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
      The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
      small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
      clinically:

                               SAREK
                 As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
                 traditionally not present at the moment
                 of delivery.

                                AMANDA
                 Well traditionally, I'm not the one
                 giving birth.
                         (then)
                                (MORE)

                                               3
15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C
                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
                   I moved here -- to another planet -- to
                   be with you. I needed you to be with me
                   today. Holding my hand and telling me
                   I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
                   breathing the best I can.

      Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
      the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
      this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:

                                 SAREK
                   You are correct. I should have been
                   here. I am sorry.

      And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
      him. And the two look at the baby.

                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
                   I had a thought. That we might name the
                   child after one of our respected early
                   society-builders. His name was "Spock".

      She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.

                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
                   Your silence does not suggest enormous
                   enthusiasm.

                                  AMANDA
                   No... Spock.
                           (smiles, touches his
                            face)
                   ... Spock.

      She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.

                                 SAREK
                   The child has your eyes.

      She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She
      gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
      revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.

                                 AMANDA
                   ... and your ears.

      And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
      we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
      SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS
      -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
      OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:

                                                4


15D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN [FORMER SC. 15A]                               15D

      With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and
      OFFICER PITTS:


               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      OFFICER PITTS
      -- our sensors haven't made        -- no sir, it looked like a
      sense of the anomaly?              lightning storm in the middle
      -- how far are we from the         of space --
      Klingon Neutral Zone?              -- 150,000 kilometers, but the
                                         vessel is not Klingon, Sir,
                                         its registry doesn't match any
                                         recorded profile --

      SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a
      flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on
      the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Report.

      -- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,
      swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:

                               FIRST OFFICER
                 Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.

               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
      Are they transmitting on any       Negative, Captain -- all

                                         shut down.

               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
      Hail the ship. What's the          Nothing even close, Sir.
      closest match on registry?

      Robau moves to Pitts:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Any response?

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 No Sir -- hails met with silence.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Maybe they're incapable -- any
                 identifiable damage?

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem
                 confused--

                                              5
15D   CONTINUED:                                                        15D

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   Confused?

                                 OFFICER PITTS
                   -- not only is the ship unregistered --
                   but even its construction materials seem
                   unrecognizable.

      Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they
      approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA --
      ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   ... oh my God...
                           (to himself, boggled)
                   A lightning storm... then this...

                   Signal all departments: first contact
                   protocols. Looks like we have someone

      And in the endless vacuum of space, and in TOTAL SILENCE, the
      Kelvin appears as a dot, coming to a stop in front of the
      gigantic BLACK CLAW that is the Narada --

19D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                       19D

      Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   That could be seen as an act of
                   provocation -- all readings passive--

      Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --


               OFFICER PITTS                     CAPTAIN ROBAU
      Sir, I have a reading --
      they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

      The Narada FIRES a TORPEDO -- IT HEADS FOR THE KELVIN -- then
      SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --

24    INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         24

      Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --
      then, on his chair com.:

                                  CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Damage report!

      INTERCUT with:

24A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    24A

      Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:

                               CHIEF ENGINEER
                 Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen
                 anything like it! Weapons off-line!
                 Main power at 38 percent!

      As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls
      himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an
      inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every
      passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH:

24B   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 26B]   24B

      A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam
      table, afraid -- and pregnant. This is WINONA.

                                             7
24B   CONTINUED:                                                     24B

                                 WINONA
                   -- what was that-- what's happening?!

      But the First Officer is just relieved that she's still alive:

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   -- you're okay-- thank God-- where are
                   you?

                                 WINONA
                   Medical bay-- I had a few close
                   contractions-- I'm fine-- what was that?

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Just sit tight-- stay there-- we'll be
                   fine--

      Or maybe not:

                                 OFFICER PITTS
                   They're firing another, Captain!

25    EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                           25

      ANOTHER NARADA TORPEDO -- it SEPARATES, pieces HIT the Kelvin.

25A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    25A

      A FEMALE CREW MEMBER running down the hall suddenly HOLDS ON as
      a HOLE IS RIPPED IN THE HALL -- and she's YANKED OUT OF THE
      CORRIDOR -- the CAMERA finally getting sucked out too!

                   Prepare the shuttles f--

      And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their
      VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada,
      whom we'll come to know as AYEL:

                                 AYEL
                   My commander requests the presence of
                   your captain in order to negotiate a
                   cease-fire. You will come aboard our
                   ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal
                   would be unwise.

      Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A
      tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:

                                   CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   Walk with me.

      The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO:

26A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS                        26A

      As they walk, briskly:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   If I don't report within fifteen minutes,
                   execute general order 13.

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Sir, we could issue a mayday call to--

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                           (frightened, but firm)
                   There is no help for us out here. If
                   we're going down, we're taking them with
                   us -- you save as many as you can.

                                             8A
26A   CONTINUED:                                                       26A

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   ... aye, Captain.

      Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes,
      knowing what this means. Finally:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.

      He's gone.   And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father.

26B-C OMIT                                                         26B-C

26D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26D

      All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair.
      Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital
                 signs to the main view screen.

                                OFFICER PITTS
                 Yessir.

      In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors --
      his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW-
      PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --

                               SCIENCE OFFICER

                               GEORGE KIRK

                 -- thank you.

26DA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    26DA

      TILT DOWN as the TURBO-LIFT DESCENDS -- we PUSH IN as the doors
      open and Captain Robau gets out -- moves quickly -- hurries down
      a SHUTTLE BAY catwalk --

26DB INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 26C]                       26DB

      Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the
      cockpit -- starts the vehicle up --

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Computer, initiate departure sequence.

      A LOUD HISS and the craft SHUDDERS as it disembarks --

26DC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26DC

      Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes
      on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS
      of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He
      realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 The shuttle's pulling out of main bay,
                 Sir.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 I want to see him -- floodlights please.

26E   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SPACE                                     26E

      Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn,
      FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the
      KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada.

26EA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26EA

      Backlit by the distant floodlights, Robau remains steely-eyed as
      he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves --

26F   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                    26F

      And Robau's HEARTBEAT QUICKENS -- the tension they all feel:

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 His heart rate's elevated--

                                   HELMSMAN
                 He's scared.

                                 GEORGE KIRK
                 He's brave.    That's what he is.

26FA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26FA

      Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the
      SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then --

26FB EXT. NARADA - SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                26FB

      ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle
      seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires
      of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS
      everywhere. A gigantic IRIS DOOR TURNS, SLOWLY OPENS -- and the
      shuttle enters the Narada's main HANGAR -- the door CLOSES --

26FC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26FC

      And everyone is just motionless and silent. Only Robau's VITAL
      SIGNS can be HEARD, BEEPING away. George's eyes glued ahead --

26G   INT. SHUTTLE/NARADA HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        26G

      TIGHT ON ROBAU as he faces the shuttle door, considering his
      fate. Finally the SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS -- standing there are
      eight ROMULAN GUARDS, brandishing WEAPONS. He steps down. They
      grab him, hard -- he's SCANNED -- FRISKED -- PULLED ALONG -- and
      we REVEAL the absolutely MASSIVE HANGAR, the insane architecture
      of the interior of this dark, wet, dripping ship --

                                               11


26H   INT. NARADA BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                     26H

      Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans
      at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
      he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted
      and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A
      presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

      Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
      Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
      will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).

                               AYEL
                 Are you familiar with this craft?

      Robau regards it.   Then:

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Who is your commander?
                         (silence, then re: Nero)
                 Is it him?

                               AYEL
                 You will speak only to me.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Then ask your commander what right he has
                 to attack a Federation vessel.

                               AYEL
                 That was hardly an attack. My commander
                 will easily destroy your ship. If you do
                 not respond to the question.

      Robau considers the hologram again.     And what his answer might
      mean for the fate of his crew.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.

                               AYEL
                 Are you familiar with -- or better, know
                 the location of -- Ambassador Spock?

      Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE
      OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born
      just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

                               AYEL
                 A final question. What is the current
                 stardate?

                   THAT'S AN ORDER! GO!

                   I have medical shuttle 37 standing by,

                   baby, it's coming now.

      PUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver
      incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he

                 It's a boy?   Yeah?

      And now we see Winona, handed this beautiful little boy.   And
      she cries, just looking at him --

                 He's-- he's beautiful, he looks like you.

      Heartsick, George laughs -- glances at the MONITORS -- SELF-
      DESTRUCT COUNTDOWN IS AT T-MINUS 20 SECONDS -- oh God...

                               WINONA (CONT'D)

                 I know-- so what should we call him, huh?

                               WINONA
                 We could name him after your father.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No,
                 that's the worst-- we'll name him after
                 your dad-- let's call him Jim.

                                WINONA
                 ... Jim.   Jim it is.

      Through the VIEWSCREEN -- he's ABOUT TO HIT -- the ship ANGLES
      within the enormous Narada blades -- George scared now --

38    EXT. NARADA - CONTINUOUS                                            38

      -- the Kelvin SLAMS INTO THE NARADA -- an EXPLOSION BEGINS and--

38A   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                 38A

      George's voice goes STATIC -- confusion washes over her face --
      suddenly LIT BY A BRIGHT GLOW -- she looks over, with wet
      devastated eyes --

      -- what she sees is the MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- quickly SUCKED AWAY
      in the vacuum of space -- and she's CRYING -- holding her new
      baby who just lost a father -- his life altered forever...

39    OMIT                                                                39

40    EXT. STARFIELD - ETERNAL NIGHT                                      40

      The shuttle SAILS AWAY with the others... HOLD ON THIS... for a
      long beat. Then PAN OVER to see NERO'S SHIP TUMBLING SILENTLY
      THROUGH SPACE -- DEBRIS still raining from the explosion --

41    INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                   41

      MAYHEM: ALARMS and CREW work to stabilize the ship (OVERLAPPING
      ROMULAN DIALOG TO BE WRITTEN) -- we arrive at Nero, who, with
      small specks of HUMAN BLOOD on his face, just STARES at the
      fucking HOLOGRAM OF SPOCK -- he's OBSESSED.

      Ayel works a monitor, yelling out something (in Romulan) to one
      of their men -- and as a result:

42    EXT. NARADA - CONTINUOUS                                            42

      Gargantuan "BLADES" EXTEND from the ship like otherworldly SAILS
      -- and the ship begins to STEADY -- but then ANOTHER SHIP
      APPEARS -- DECLOAKING FROM NOTHINGNESS: a fucking KLINGON VESSEL
      -- then ANOTHER -- AND ANOTHER --

43    INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                   43

      And we're on Ayel as he witnesses, on his monitor, ships,
      popping up ALL AROUND THEM -- which is when they HEAR a VOICE --
      speaking KLINGON -- and we SUBTITLE:

                                              19
43   CONTINUED:                                                          43

                                KLINGON VOICE (P.A.)
                  Trespassing vessel: you have entered the
                  jurisdiction of the Klingon Empire.
                  Power down and prepare to be boarded or
                  you will be destroyed.

     Eyes wide, Ayel turns to Nero, still staring at Spock's image:

                                AYEL
                          (SUBTITLED, in Romulan)
                  Commander Nero -- we're surrounded.

     Finally Nero looks up.

                                AYEL (CONT'D)
                          (SUBTITLED, in Romulan)
                  Sir-- what are your orders?

     And we PUSH IN ON NERO as our MUSIC BUILDS, then we CUT TO:

44   OMIT                                                                 44

45   INT. VULCAN LEARNING CENTER - DAY                                    45

     CLOSE ON a young VULCAN BOY. 11 years old. SPOCK. He's
     standing in an abstract space -- IMAGES PROJECTED and HOVERING --
     questions -- that he's answering as they appear, then disappear:

             COMPUTER VOICE                           SPOCK
     What is the square root of
     2,396,304?                          -- one-thousand-five-hundered-
                                         forty-eight --
     -- Correct. What is the
     central assumption of Quantum       -- everything that can happen
     Cosmology?                          does happen, in equal and
                                         parallel universes --
     -- Correct. Identify the 20th
     century earth composers of the
     following musical progression:      -- Paul McCartney and John
                                         Lennon.
     -- Correct

     And we find ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD -- then ANOTHER -- all in these
     odd spaces -- until we PULL BACK WIDE to reveal a large Vulcan
     LEARNING CENTER -- white "bowls", sunk into the dark ground,
     where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this
     mass "mental martial arts" test.

     We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND
     THE LIGHT OVER HER BOWL GOES OUT. Then ANOTHER CHILD -- who
     gets an answer wrong -- and HIS LIGHT GOES OUT. An EXTREMELY
     WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT reveals BOWL AFTER BOWL as the LIGHTS GO OUT.

                                               20
45   CONTINUED:                                                         45

     Until only one bowl remains. Spock's. He finishes his last
     question. Gets it right. PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS:

                                COMPUTER VOICE
                  Your score is one-hundred percent.
                  Congratulations. Spock.

     Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his
     things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
     him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                  I presume you've prepared new insults for
                  today.

                                VULCAN BULLY #1
                  Your mother lies with many men.

     Spock just NODS.   Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                  I have no such information.

                                VULCAN BULLY #2
                  You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
                  therefore, have no place in the universe.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                          (swallowing that too)
                  This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
                  elicit an emotional response from me.
                  Logic dictates you would cease by now.

                               VULCAN BULLY #1
                  Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
                  don't they?

                                VULCAN BULLY #2
                  Perhaps an emotional response requires
                  physical stimuli.

     And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
     into one of the bowls. He looks up as:

                                VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D)
                  He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
                  For marrying her.

     Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --
     AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They
     land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2!
     The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure
     what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:

                                              21


46   INT. LEARNING CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER                             46

     TIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive
     VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents
     ARGUE at a distance down the hall:

                 AMANDA                                SAREK
     -- where I'm from, when
     someone hits you, you hit back-
     - how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable
     -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being
     tease him -- every day.            physically injured --
                                        -- Which is precisely when
                                        reason must guide his actions
     -- I want him to embrace           above all.
     Vulcan, you know that... but
     he has to be himself-- which
     means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the
     human.                             source of his ostracism.
     -- When Vulcans get disgusted
     with each other, they never
     just walk away, do they?           -- No.
     -- Well humans do.

     And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --
     sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
     IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
     front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

                              YOUNG SPOCK
                I did not mean to create conflict between
                you and mother.

     After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his
     face. Takes a seat beside his son...

                              SAREK
                In marriage... conflict is...

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                ... constant?

                              SAREK
                Natural.
                        (a beat)
                Emotions run deep within our race. In
                many ways, more deeply than in humans.
                Long ago, they nearly destroyed us...
                that is why we followed the teachings of
                Surak. Now you must choose.

                              YOUNG SPOCK
                ... between you and mother?

46   CONTINUED:                                                            46

                                SAREK
                  Never, my son. But you may choose the
                  ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity
                  humans seldom experience. The control of
                  feelings... so that they do not control
                  you.

                                 YOUNG SPOCK
                  They called you a traitor.
                          (then)
                  You suggest that I should be completely
                  Vulcan... and yet you married a human...
                  why?

     Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady:

                                SAREK
                  As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to
                  observe and understand human behavior.
                  Marrying your mother... was logical.
                          (Spock seems disquieted)
                  Spock. You are fully capable of choosing
                  your own destiny. The question you are
                  faced with... is which path you will
                  take. This is something only you can
                  decide.

47   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                             47

     BAM -- a door opens: 14 year-old GEORGE KIRK, JR. angrily exits
     the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE
     FRANK following. 11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them:

                                UNCLE FRANK
                  Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I
                  could give a damn!

                                  YOUNG KIRK
                  -- wait-- no!    Where are you going?

                                GEORGE JR.
                  Anywhere but here, far as I can get!

                                UNCLE FRANK
                  Which won't be far enough -- know what
                  your problem is?!
                          (big luggie spit)
                  No one ever taught you respect! How to
                  follow orders! Do as you're told!
                          (to Jim)
                  -- what the hell are you doing?

                                YOUNG KIRK
                  I-- I just don't want my brother to go.

                                            23
47    CONTINUED:                                                      47

                                 UNCLE FRANK
                   Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the
                   car! How many damn times do I need to
                   repeat myself?! How many damn times?
                   How many?

      A glare to George and Frank walks off. Jim nervously follows
      his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC --

                                 YOUNG KIRK
                   Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!

      George hits it away:

                                  GEORGE JR.
                   This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank.
                   I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no
                   idea what he's like when she's not here--
                   d'you hear him talking like he's our
                   dad?! And that's not even his car you're
                   washing! That was Dad's car! You know
                   why you're washing it? Because he's
                   gonna sell it!

                                 JIM
                   Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom
                   when she gets back from Africa.

                                  GEORGE JR.
                   She's gone for five more months, by then
                   I'll be in a different system.
                           (sees fear in Kirk)
                   You're gonna be okay. You always are.
                   Always doing everything right -- good
                   grades and obeying every stupid order...
                           (then)
                   I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me
                   how to do that and I'll stay.

      But Jim can offer nothing. George gives him a quick hug and
      walks off. Jim sadly watches his brother go.

47A   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       47A

      Kirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the
      sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over
      his brother's departure. Devastated.

      And he's wiping the soapy passenger window (SQEEEEEEAK!) with
      the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition.
      PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE-
      LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO:

48-49 OMIT                                                          48-49

50    EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY - LATER                                 50

      THE CORVETTE BLASTS ONTO SCREEN, FISHTAILING ONTO THE ROAD,
      young Jim Kirk behind the wheel (NOTE: The SOUND of the engine
      is a metallic WHIR -- not a gas engine). TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as
      he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as
      he is determined --

50A   EXT. IOWA ROAD - DAY - LATER                                     50A

      The CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the
      updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing
      control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD
      ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING
      SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD.

      He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but
      with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING
      CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES
      through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC
      AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS
      -- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF --
      SPEEDING AFTER HIM, SIREN BLARING!

      BACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the
      REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP
      BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he
      calls through his PA:

                               COP
                 Son, you pull over that car!

      But Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER:

                               JIM
                 I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

51    EXT. IOWA ROAD - CONTINUOUS                                       51

      George, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of
      the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks...
      familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE
      WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the
      middle of the road, mouth agape --

                                 GEORGE JR.
                 -- no... way.

      Back at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE
      COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a
      perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS
      QUICKLY to follow --

     Jim is now officially LOVING THIS -- and he DRIVES THROUGH a
     FENCE -- CRASH! The Cop RACES through it, in the Corvette's
     DUST -- and we PUSH IN on a SIGN that reads "DANGER - QUARRY
     AHEAD -- IOWA MINING CO." In fact --

52   EXT. QUARRY - CONTINUOUS                                          52

     We see the MASSIVE QUARRY -- hundreds of feet deep -- and TILT
     UP to the Corvette and Cop speeding toward it --

53   INT. CORVETTE - MOVING - CONTINUOUS                               53

     KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been
     headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this
     is how James Kirk dies. He speeds toward the edge -- CLOSER --
     CLOSER -- but at the last second, Kirk SLAMS the brake -- the
     car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR, WHICH SAILS
     SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING... falling... the COP
     comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES
     ON THE QUARRY FLOOR --

     The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as Jim
     Kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.

                                COP
                  What's your name, son?

     And as he stands, we PUSH IN on him -- LOW and WIDE -- damn if
     that kid doesn't have a swagger. It's like the first time he's
     ever stood in his life.

                                JIM
                  My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.

     And as our MUSIC BUILDS we CUT TO:

54   EXT. RURA PENTHE- MINING QUARRY - NIGHT [FORMER OMIT]             54

     CONSTANT SHOCKS OF LIGHT as an ALIEN PRISONER -- intelligent, bi-
     pedal, but with FOUR TERRIFIED EYES -- is SLAMMED DOWN onto the
     wet pavement -- a CHOKE STICK SHOVED under his chin -- then:
     VOICES. Brutal, guttural KLINGON --

                                KLINGON GUARD (O.S.)
                          (SUBTITLED)
                  You say they are not yours...

     WHIP PAN TO SEE the scary KLINGON GUARDS -- four of them --
     standing above the Alien -- chilling MASKS hide their hideous
     faces -- and one holds a FLUORESCENT SET OF PAGES --

                                KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
                  ... these Federation maps we found in
                  your pockets.

      And the ALIEN SPEAKS -- an UNKNOWN LANGUAGE -- all eyes wild:

                                 ALIEN
                           (SUBTITLED)
                   I speak the truth. I do.

                                 KLINGON GUARD
                   Then who are they for?

      But the Alien just SHAKES HIS HEAD, afraid -- he will not talk.
      So they GRAB HIM AND YANK HIM UPWARD --

                                 KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
                   You would rather die then tell us?

      PUSH IN TIGHT as the Alien finally WHISPERS, terrified:

                                 ALIEN
                   ... NERO!!!

      And the Guards look at each other... seemingly with concern...

      MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER -- and we PAN WITH THEM
      to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON
      YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was
      LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS:
      "RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're
      heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING
      ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to
      find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards.
      And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them --
      THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses
      Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And
      offers his cuffed hands, willingly.

54A   INT. RURA PENTHE - HOLDING BLOCK - NIGHT [FORMER SC. 64B]        54A

      Guards drag Nero through the massive pyramidal structure...

54B   INT. RURA PENTHE - INTERROGATION CELL - NIGHT [FORMER SC. 64C]   54B

      Nero's ARMS AND LEGS get STRAPPED IN TIGHT. Go WIDE to reveal
      he's pinned to an interrogation table -- three GUARDS. A
      KLINGON INTERROGATOR approaches; looms over Nero, studying the
      Romulan's face with clinical detachment...

                                  KLINGON INTERROGATOR
                           (SUBTITLED KLINGON)
                   I have come far to meet you. "The One
                   Who Does Not Speak." Ten years is a long
                   time to maintain silence.
                           (beat)
                   Perhaps you simply do not speak Klingon,
                   just as I do not speak Romulan.

                   But I assume we both speak the language
                   of our common enemy.

      (NOTE: FROM NOW ON, OUR NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS WILL SPEAK ENGLISH,
      UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.) He reveals a worn LEATHER JOURNAL.
      Opens it, flips through it almost casually... we see SKETCHES of
      the JELLYFISH SHIP, PAGES OF COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS...

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   We found this book in your cell.
                   Cartography, mathematics-- what do these
                   mean? This date here -- eleven years
                   from now-- what happens then?
                           (holds up the
                            FLUORESCENT MAPS)
                   And why attempt to smuggle in maps of
                   Federation space?

      Nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. Cold as fucking
      ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:
      A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book.

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   When you were captured we assumed you
                   were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil
                   the Empire. But because the Romulans
                   deny your existence, I believe you are
                   much more than that.

      Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches
      with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-
      FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   Your ship remains in orbit above us now.
                   We've been asking for its secrets for too
                   long. That is why I am here. We want to
                   know how it works and I believe now,
                   finally... you will tell us.

      A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature
      you've seen from the container: a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes,
      covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS.

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   Centaurian slugs. Their native planet is
                   in constant sunlight. As a result,
                   there's nothing they hate more... than
                   darkness.

      A Guard GRABS NERO'S HEAD and FORCES IT BACK; the second PRIES
      HIS MOUTH OPEN with his hands.

      Another Guard SHOVES THE THING INTO NERO'S MOUTH -- Nero keeps
      his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as
      they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESN'T SCREAM as the
      wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his
      stomach --

                               KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                 They try to claw and bite their way out
                 of any dark space they're in.

      Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but
      straining to block it out. PUSH DOWN on Nero's wide, crazed
      eyes -- TIGHTER as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO SEE WHAT HE'S SEEING --
      WHAT'S KEEPING HIM FROM LOSING HIS MIND -- DREAMLIKE, ETHEREAL
      IMAGES OF A WOMAN -- HER BEAUTIFUL, SMILING FACE -- SHE'S
      ROMULAN -- LOOKING AT US, EYES FULL OF LOVE -- AND SHE TURNS AND

57    INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY           57

      Quiet. A waiting area. AMANDA, Spock's mother, stands alone in
      a passageway. She looks off-camera to her son:

                               AMANDA
                 Spock, come here, let me see you.

                                   SPOCK (O.S.)
                          (beat)
                 No.

                                   AMANDA
                 Spock.

      Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his
      collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying
      like hell to look impassive.

                               AMANDA (CONT'D)
                 There is no need to be so anxious.
                 You'll do fine.

                               SPOCK
                 I am hardly "anxious", mother.
                         (beat, then, anxiously)
                 And "fine" has variable definitions.
                 "Fine" is unacceptable.

      She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it
      annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his
      collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he
      doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.

                  May I ask a personal query?

                                  AMANDA
                  ... anything.

                                SPOCK
                  Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
                  discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all
                  emotion... I trust you will not feel it
                  reflects judgement upon you.

     She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face.

                                AMANDA
                  As always... whoever you choose to be...
                  you will have a proud mother.

     HOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded:

58   INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58

     An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before
     the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
     seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  You have surpassed the expectations of
                  your instructors. Your final record is
                  flawless. With one exception. I see you
                  have applied to Starfleet as well.

                                SPOCK
                  It was logical to cultivate multiple
                  options.

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
                  accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
                  A distinction all the more significant
                  given that you will be its first half-
                  human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
                  Spock. That you have achieved so much
                  despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
                  the Academy.

     They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

                                SPOCK
                  If you would clarify, Minister-- what
                  "disadvantage" are you referring to?

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  ... your human mother.

                                               30
58   CONTINUED:                                                         58

     As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same
     look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his
     father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.
     His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes
     the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --

                                SPOCK
                  Council -- ministers.    I must decline.

     Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  No Vulcan has ever declined admission to
                  this academy.

                                SPOCK
                  Then as I am half-human, your record
                  remains untarnished.

                  SAREK                               SPOCK
     Spock. You have made a
     commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can
     way--                                think of no greater way to
                                          honor our race than to attend
                                          Starfleet as its first Vulcan.

                                 SCIENCE MINISTER
                  Why did you come before this council
                  today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
                  need to rebel?

                                SPOCK
                  I came with the intention of enrolling,
                  as my father wished. However, your
                  "insight" has convinced me otherwise.
                  Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
                  convey is gratitude. Thank you,
                  Ministers, for your consideration.
                          (a contained "fuck you")
                  Live long and prosper.

     He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident --
     still, God bless him, Spock walks out --

     JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty,
     dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives
     him a look, then back to the bartender:

                                UHURA
                  And a shot of Jack, straight up.

                                KIRK
                          (to the bartender)
                  Make it two -- her shot's on me.

                                UHURA
                  Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

                                KIRK
                  Don't you want my name before you
                  completely reject me?

                                UHURA
                  I'm good without it.

     Damn, he likes her already.

                                KIRK
                  You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim
                  Kirk.
                          (long beat)
                  If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna
                  have to make one up.

                                    UHURA
                           (beat)
                  Uhura.

                                KIRK
                  Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was
                  gonna make up for you. Uhura what?

                                    UHURA
                  Just Uhura.

                                KIRK
                  They don't have last names in your world?

                                              32

                              UHURA
                Uhura is my last name.

                              KIRK
                They don't have first names in your
                world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?

     That makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her:

                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.
                What's your focus?

                              UHURA
                Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't
                know what that means.

                              KIRK
                Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
                phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means
                you've got a talented tongue.

                              UHURA
                And for a moment I thought you were just
                a dumb hick who only has sex with farm
                animals.

                                KIRK
                Well.    Not only.

                              UHURA
                You think you're smart.

                              KIRK
                Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.

     Something sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears.

                              BURLY CADET
                This guy bothering you?

                              UHURA
                Beyond belief, but nothing I can't
                handle.

                              KIRK
                You could handle me.    That's an
                invitation.

     The Burly Cadet spins Kirk around:

                                BURLY CADET
                Hey.    You mind your manners.

                                             33

                               KIRK
                At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like
                your hairline.

     Uhura turns back.    The other cadets, seeing trouble, approach.

                              UHURA
                Hey -- Jim: enough.

                                   BURLY CADET
                What was that?

                              KIRK
                You heard me, Moon Beam.

                              BURLY CADET
                You know how to count farm boy?    There's
                five of us... and one of you.

                              KIRK
                Okay, so go get some more guys, come back
                and it'll be an even fight.

     The cadet swings his fist but Kirk HEADBUTTS HIS HAND, BREAKING
     IT -- another Cadet PUNCHES KIRK, then THROWS HIM into a table,
     which Kirk FLIES OVER, landing hard -- another Cadet GRABS HIM,
     pulls him up -- Kirk SLAMS FIVE FAST PUNCHES that send the Cadet
     back -- when ANOTHER CADET PUNCHES HIM -- yet another HOLDS KIRK
     -- and that last punch is repeated THREE-- then FOUR times --

                                   UHURA
                Enough!    STOP!

     Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but
     won't give up. The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -
     - and Kirk's spirited, but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when
     an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --
     standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged Starfleet officer --
     CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER PIKE.

                              PIKE
                Outside, all of you!       NOW!

     The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semi-
     conscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.

                              PIKE (CONT'D)
                Y'alright, Son?

                              KIRK
                You can... whistle really loud, y'know
                that?

     -- and Kirk PASSES OUT.

61   INT. "WARP TRAIL BAR" - NIGHT                                 61

     HIGH WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT of the almost-closed bar. Only Kirk and
     Pike sit here at a table. Kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.

                              PIKE
                I couldn't believe when the bartender
                told me who you are.

                              KIRK
                ... and who am I, Captain Pike?

                              PIKE
                Your father's son.
                        (then, smiles)
                For my dissertation, I was assigned the
                U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
                your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
                scenarios.

                              KIRK
                He sure learned his lesson.

                               PIKE
                Depends on how you define winning.
                You're here, aren't you?
                        (off Kirk's look)
                That instinct to leap without looking--
                that was his nature, too. And in my
                opinion it's something Starfleet has
                lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
                overly-disciplined.
                        (beat)
                Those cadets you took on, they'll make
                competent officers -- but you can bet
                your ass they'll run home to momma the
                minute they're looking down the barrel of
                a Klingon phaser cannon.

                              KIRK
                -- why are you talking to me?

                              PIKE
                I looked up your file while you were
                drooling on the floor. Your aptitude
                tests were off the charts-- what is it,
                d'you like being the only Genius Level
                repeat-offender in the midwest?

                              KIRK
                Maybe I love it.

61   CONTINUED:                                                       61

                                 PIKE
                  So your daddy dies... you can settle for
                  a less-than-ordinary life.
                          (beat)
                  Or do you feel like you're meant for
                  something better? Something special?

     And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
     nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
     mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

                                KIRK
                  Come to think of it, I do want to feel
                  special. You know what? I'm gonna go
                  start a book club--

                                PIKE
                  Enlist in Starfleet.

                                KIRK
                  Enlist. You must be way down on your
                  recruiting quota for the month--

                                PIKE
                  If you're half the man your father was,
                  Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could
                  be an officer in four years, have your
                  own ship in eight.

     He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,
     grabs his jacket, stands --

                                KIRK
                  We're even, right?   I can go.

                                PIKE
                  Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
                  recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.
                          (Kirk turns, Pike grabs
                           him)
                  Your father was Captain of a Starship.
                  For twelve minutes. I dare you to do
                  better.

     Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And
     that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...

62   EXT. IOWA PLAINS - SUNRISE                                        62

     CORN STALKS whipping by -- Kirk on his SPOKELESS MOTORCYCLE
     rocketing across the plains -- his soul's been stirred and he's
     fighting it -- he cranks it, ELECTRIC ENGINE SCREAMING --

                                            36


63   EXT. STARFLEET CONSTRUCTION YARD - SUNRISE                       63

     Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE
     AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for
     an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the
     skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE
     U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our
     MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his
     future, his fate.

64   EXT. STARFLEET SHIPYARD - MORNING                                64

     The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a
     shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT
     approaches:

                              SHUTTLE PILOT
                Waiting for something, Cap?

                               PIKE
                ... No.   Guess not.

     He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
     a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
     viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
     KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --

                              PIKE (CONT'D)
                Hold her a second...

     Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
     near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
     the clothes on his back.

                              SHIPYARD WORKER
                Nice ride, man.

     Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --

                               KIRK
                Live it up.

     Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.

                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.

     Pike grins as Kirk passes him.

     Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some
     of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK
     UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.

                                            37

                                KIRK (CONT'D)
                  At ease, Gentlemen.
                          (then, to Uhura)
                  Never did get that first name.

                                UHURA
                          (can't help it: a grin)
                  And you never will.

     He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps
     in as it RISES...

                                MAN'S VOICE
                  Are you people deaf? I told you I don't
                  need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!

     Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
     FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
     like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:

             FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN
     -- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom,
                                       Darlin', with no windows --
     -- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia,
     siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big
     sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying
     RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'

     They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
     beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
     armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:

                                MAN
                  I might throw up on you.

                                KIRK
                  I think these things're pretty safe--

                                MAN
                  Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack
                  in the hull and our blood boils in
                  thirteen seconds -- solar flare might
                  crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell,
                  some of the damn passengers are blue.
                  And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a
                  case of Andorian shingles, see if you're
                  still so relaxed when your eyeballs are
                  bleeding-- space is disease and danger,
                  wrapped in darkness and silence.

                                KIRK
                  I hate to break this to you, but

      Nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi-conscious, looking like
      death. Behind him the DOOR OPENS. Two KLINGON GUARDS enter,
      backlit.

                               KLINGON GUARD #1
                 The day you've been waiting for is upon
                 us, Silent One. And look. No sign of
                 salvation. No sign of change. Just more
                 pain.

      And they both lift his limp body up -- as something miraculous
      happens -- NERO SNAPS TO LIFE AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE SHIT
      OUT OF THE GUARDS -- TAKING THEM BOTH DOWN IN TEN SECONDS -- in
      what seems like an instant, he's the only one standing here --
      holding both of the Guards' rifles -- which he TWIRLS, badass.

      TILT DOWN from a GLIMMERING BUILDING TO REVEAL a sea of RED
      CADET UNIFORMS: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across campus, McCoy and
      Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco beneath a
      blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk struts:

                               KIRK
                 So you'll do it for me, right?

                               MCCOY
                 I have no interest.

                               KIRK
                 I didn't ask if you have interest, I
                 asked if you'd do it.

                               MCCOY
                 I'm about to ask you an obvious question:
                 why bother?

                               KIRK
                 Because I've failed the test twice.

                               MCCOY
                 And you're determined to make it three.
                 We've all failed it-- everyone has, and
                 that's the point! No one goes back for
                 seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not
                 like you need to pass it to graduate.

                               KIRK
                 So Bones: why do they make us take it?

                               MCCOY
                 I told you to stop calling me that.
                 You're very annoying.

                               KIRK
                 And you're the greatest -- thank you.

                               MCCOY
                 You'd better study for it this time.

                               KIRK
                 Oh, no-- Bones -- I gotta date.

                                 MCCOY
                   A date? Listen, as smart as you are,
                   which ain't much, if you don't prepare--

                                 KIRK
                   You have no idea how prepared I'm gonna
                   be-- no idea.

      And with a smile, Kirk heads off -- McCoy watches him go,
      calling after him:

                                 MCCOY
                   Seriously, stop calling me Bones!

      In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind
      of bra, moaning in delight -- this is GAILA --

                   ... Yeah. I sent you a message.

      Gaila reaches over, turns on the light and we realize: SHE'S
      GREEN. And not particularly happy:

                                 GAILA
                   I say "I love you", and you say "I sent

                                        What is it? What does it say?
      -- Gaila, promise me you're
      not going to open it 'till        -- what is it?    Tell me what

                  You can't get caught in this dorm-- hide!
                  Under the bed, quick!

     Kirk falls, lands hard on the floor, SCRAMBLES under the bed as
     Gaila's roommate enters -- UHURA. Dropping her backpack:

                                GAILA (CONT'D)
                  Hey-- I thought you were going to be in
                  the long-range sensor lab all night.

                                UHURA
                  I was supposed to be, but it was crazy, I
                  picked up an emergency transmission from
                  a Klingon prison planet -- there was an
                  escape and a ship stolen from th--
                          (suddenly senses)
                  ... you okay?

                                GAILA
                  Yeah, been running simulations all week,
                  just catching up on some rest. Tired.
                          (fake yawn)
                  That's all.

     Uhura watches her.   Her eyes narrow.

                                UHURA
                  Were you running simulations with the
                  mouth-breather hiding under the bed?

     Gaila freezes, caught.   Uhura looks down, Kirk PEERS OUT.

                                KIRK
                  Your hearing is scary-- you sure both
                  your parents are human?

                If I pass, will you tell me your first

                               UHURA
                No.   Good night.

                              KIRK
                        (quiet, tries to charm)
                I think the fact that you picked up a
                transmission of a Klingon prison escape
                is very interesting.

                   Starfleet Command has ordered us to

                   Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?

                                    ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                   James T. Kirk.     Step forward.

      It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible
      through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them.
      He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS.

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   An incident has occurred today that
                   concerns the entire student body.
                   Academic immorality by one is an assault
                   on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet
                   Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this
                   council suggesting you violated the
                   ethical code of conduct pursuant to
                   regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code.
                   Is there anything you care to say before
                   we begin?

                                 KIRK
                           (uncomfortable beat)
                   Yessir. I believe I have the right to
                   face my accuser directly.

     President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk
     MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  Step forward please. This is Commander
                  Spock, one of our most distinguished
                  graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi
                  Maru test for the last four years.

     Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods.

                                SPOCK
                  Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow
                  managed to install and activate a sub-
                  routine in the programming code, thereby
                  changing the conditions of the test.

     We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.

                                KIRK
                  Your point being?

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  In academic vernacular, you cheated.

                                  KIRK
                  Respectfully.    Define "cheating".

                                SPOCK
                  To deceive by trickery.

                                 KIRK
                  Now let me ask you something I think we
                  all know the answer to: the test is
                  rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to
                  be unwinnable.

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of
                  the exam is relevant to these
                  proceedings.

                                KIRK
                  Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test
                  itself is a cheat.

                                SPOCK
                  Your argument precludes the possibility
                  of a no-win scenario --

                                KIRK
                  I don't believe in no-win scenarios --

     FIND PIKE amongst the officers in attendance. His eyes locked
     on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.

                               SPOCK
                 Then not only have you violated the
                 rules, you've failed to understand the
                 principle lesson.

                               KIRK
                 Please, enlighten me.

                               SPOCK
                 You, of all people should know, Cadet
                 Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.

     ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed.      The cockiness
     slips away as he senses where this is going --

                               KIRK
                 "I of all people?"

                               SPOCK
                 Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had
                 assumed command of his vessel before
                 killed in action, did he not?

     Shit.   The DADDY card.   Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --

                               KIRK
                 How long did it take you to look that up?

                               SPOCK
                 How long did it take you to program the
                 virus that allowed you to cheat?

     The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't,
     it's just too damn entertaining...

                               KIRK
                 Maybe you just don't like that I beat
                 your test.

                               SPOCK
                 I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our
                 vernacular. I've simply made the logical
                 deduction that you're a liar.

                               KIRK
                 What an idiot I am for taking that
                 personally --

                               SPOCK
                 Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to
                 divine the purpose of the test.

                              KIRK
                Enlighten me again.

                              SPOCK
                The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
                in the face of certain death. To accept
                that fear and maintain command of one's
                self and one's crew. This is a quality
                expected in every Starfleet captain.

     Kirk absorbs that.   Then --

                              KIRK
                So you're telling me the point.      Of the
                whole thing. Is to be afraid?

                              SPOCK
                Fear is necessary, yes.

                              KIRK
                Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?

                              SPOCK
                Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
                additional training to control my
                narcissism when making command decisions.

     No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
     but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.

                              KIRK
                You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
                And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
                who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
                people don't experience fear at all?

     ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
     how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -
     -

                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                And if that's the case -- What's that say
                about your ability to make command
                decisions?

     Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.
     And before this lovefest can continue --

     A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
     all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to
     the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.
     Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:

                              ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                        (to all)
                We've received a distress call from
                Vulcan.
                        (Spock reacts concerned)
                Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
                probation pending the result of your
                hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle
                Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is
                at recess until further notice --
                dismissed.

     Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly
     irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but
     before he goes --

                              PIKE
                Cheating isn't winning.

     And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two
     exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --

                  You're on academic probation. That means

     Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY
     from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-
     crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly
     STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:

     Come with me --                    -- what're you doing --?

                And while you were well aware that my
                unqualified desire was to serve on the
                U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the
                Farragut.

     Spock reacts unusually; he seems almost embarrassed.   Quiet.

                               SPOCK
                It was an attempt to avoid the appearance
                of favoritism.

     She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance:

                            UHURA
                No. No. I am assigned to the
                Enterprise.

     Their eyes hold.    He checks his tablet, makes an change:

                                 SPOCK
                Oh.     Yes, I believe you are.

     McCoy and Kirk enter fast. McCoy goes through a cabinet, preps
     a med in a hypospray SYRINGE.

                              KIRK
                What are you doing?

      McCoy ushers Kirk out of the room --

86    EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        86

      McCoy ushers Kirk to a shuttle -- a SCANNING OFFICER stops them:

                                 SCANNING OFFICER
                   "Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for

                                 MCCOY
                   But I am, and Medical Code states the

                   be determined at the discretion of his
                   attending physician, which is me.
                           (re: scanner)
                   You can see he's suffering, he needs me
                   as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to
                   this ship, so's he, or would you like to
                   explain to Captain Pike why the
                   Enterprise warped into a crisis without
                   one of its medical officers?

                                 SCANNING OFFICER

                                  MCCOY
                   As you were.

      And with that, he pulls Kirk past the speechless officer --

      Kirk, in agony, sweating, sits beside McCoy as they pass through
      the stratosphere. McCoy's peering out a window --

                                 KIRK
                   I might throw up on you.

     And through his pain, Kirk does... and is amazed...

88   INT. STARBASE ONE - SPACE DOCK - CONTINUOUS                       88

     The shuttle approaches a massive DOCKING STATION where a dozen
     STARFLEET VESSELS ARE DOCKED. But the ship we're approaching is
     miraculous: "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701" IS REVEALED ON THE HULL
     OF THE FLAGSHIP. THE QUEEN OF THE FLEET IS FULLY CONSTRUCTED
     AND READY FOR HER MAIDEN VOYAGE. The shuttle glides to the
     underside of the Enterprise. A DOCKING BAY opens --

89   INT. ENTERPRISE SHUTTLE BAY WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS                  89

     Officers move quickly on the ship -- Kirk and McCoy enter.    Kirk
     WIPING HIS BROW, pretty much SOAKED.

                                KIRK
                  Bones. Thanks for getting me on board.
                  But I don't feel right. I feel like I'm
                  leaking.

                                MCCOY
                  Oh look, the pointy-eared bastard.

     Kirk looks up -- SPOCK moves towards them, not seeing them --
     Kirk yanks McCoy out of the way -- Spock passes and enters a
     TURBOLIFT -- Kirk looks back as the doors close.

     Then we go INTO THE TURBOLIFT -- for just a moment -- as the
     doors open and we enter with Spock:

90   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                             90

     Spock walks through the glorious, gleaming new space, taking his
     position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE. PIKE at the command chair.

                                SPOCK
                  Captain, engineering reports "ready for
                  launch".

                  The maiden voyage of our newest flagship
                  deserves more pomp and circumstance than
                  we can afford today, but her christening
                  will have to be our reward for a safe
                  return--
                          (toggles intercom)
                  All decks, this is Captain Pike. Prepare
                  for immediate departure. Helm,
                  thrusters.

      WHIP PAN to the helm: HIKARU SULU turns to Pike -- at 25, he's
      the Federation's best pilot. As he works the controls:

                                 SULU
                   Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock

      The Enterprise moves away from the dock -- smaller SATELLITE
      crafts floating around it. The other FIVE STARFLEET SHIPS
      already ahead -- moving into position.

91    INT. MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                                       91

      MEDICAL STAFF preps. McCoy enters with Kirk, in amusing agony --
      McCoy helps him onto a bed, prepares another hypospray.

                   KIRK                                   MCCOY

      Pike -- and the others -- look at Sulu, who is confused --
      concerned -- searching the controls. Finally:

                 what's... wrong here...

                               PIKE
                 Is the parking brake on?

                               SULU
                         (half-laughs)

                 Have you disengaged the External Inertial
                 Dampener?

      Sulu does -- and realizes Spock is right.     He makes it work.

                               SULU
                 Ready for warp, Sir.

                 That's... the parking brake.

                  Your attention, plees: At twenty-two
                  hundred hours, telemetry detected an
                  anomaly in the Neutral Zone. What

                  Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
                  signal from the Vulcan High Council that
                  their planet was experiencing seismic
                  activity. We then lost contact with
                  Vulcan entirely.

                  two minutes. Thank you for your time.

     And as Chekov's message ends, Kirk suddenly SITS UP IN FRAME --
     his mind SPINNING, through the pain and sedative -- he tries to

      As you know, Mr. Kirk is not

      stowaway...                          it again with you, too.

      I can remove the cadet from          -- Try it! This cadet is

                   occurred on the day of my birth, before a

                 and advanced weaponry -- was never seen

                 attack took place on the edge of Klingon
                 space and at 11-hundred hours last night
                 there was an escape from a Klingon prison

                   Captain Pike-- your transporter
                   capability is disabled. You will man a
                   shuttle and come aboard the Narada for
                   negotiations. That is all.

      The transmission ENDS.   The crew stares in grave anticipation --

      diplomacy-- going over to that       -- I, too, suggest you rethink
      ship is a mistake.                   this strategy.

                               PIKE
                 Without transporters, we can't beam off
                 the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do
                 our job. I'm creating an opportunity:
                 Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will
                 space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have
                 chutes -- you'll land on that machine
                 they've lowered into the atmosphere
                 that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get
                 inside, disable that thing then beam back
                 to the ship.

      Kirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look --

                                KIRK
                 ... okay.

                               PIKE
                 Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of
                 the ship. Once we have transport
                 capability and communications back up,
                 you'll contact Starfleet and report what
                 the hell's happening here.

                   It's not a prank, Spock.   And I'm not the
                   Captain. You are.

      And with that, he's DONE. Strides off.     Kirk finally shakes off

122   EXT. ABOVE VULCAN - CONTINUOUS                                   122

      THE THREE MEN IN VIOLENT FREEFALL TOWARD THE PLANET -- IN WILD
      SPIN -- THE SENSE OF SPEED'S BEYOND EXHILARATING --

      ROCKETING THROUGH THE VOID AT 150 MPH AS THEY BREAK THROUGH THE
      PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE -- SHAKING VIOLENTLY AT TERMINAL VELOCITY --

123   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            123

      The falling trio TRACKED ON SCREEN, everyone watches, agape:

                               CHEKOV
                 Away team's entering the atmosphere --

      SPOCK and UHURA meet eyes -- this is fucking insane -- and a
      MAN'S ENTHUSIASTIC YELLING takes us to:

124   EXT. VULCAN'S ATMOSPHERE -- CONTINUOUS                           124

                               OLSON
                 WHOOOAAAHYYYEAAAAH!

      ONE BY ONE THEY STABILIZE -- FALLING FACE DOWN -- STRAIGHT PAST
      THE CABLE TENTACLES TETHERING THE DRILL TO THE NARADA WHICH GIVE
      US A SENSE OF INCREDIBLE RELATIVE SPEED AND SCALE -- THESE
      MASSIVE CABLES AT DIZZYING SPEED --

      THEY ANGLE THEIR HANDS AND FEET FOR CONTROL, GUIDING THEMSELVES
      TOWARD THE PLASMA DRILL -- SULU PULLS HIS CHUTE FIRST, THEN KIRK
      -- their chutes SNAP OPEN -- JERKING THEM HARD UPWARD AS THE RED
      SHIRT BLOWS PAST KIRK AND SULU --

                                            71
124   CONTINUED:                                                     124

                                 KIRK
                   OLSON, PULL NOW, NOW!!!

      HE DEPLOYS HIS CHUTE LAST -- 50 FT -- 40 -- 30 AND HIS CHUTE
      BILLOWS OUT, OPENED TOO LATE -- OLSEN'S FUCKING BODY SLAMS INTO
      THE EDGE OF THE CIRCULAR DRILL, BOUNCING OFF HARD STEEL AND
      RIGHT INTO ITS CENTER WHERE THE SWIRLING VORTEX SPINS -- HE'S
      INSTANTLY EVISCERATED IN THE PLASMA LIGHT!

      Kirk approaches -- more terrified than ever -- he comes in hard,
      too -- SLAMS against the drill edge, bounces but quickly gets
      his footing -- hits a button on his chute and SLITS appear in
      the fabric, suddenly there's no more drag and THE CHUTE AUTO-
      RETRACTS into Kirk's pack -- A REUSABLE PARACHUTE.

      BUT SULU ISN'T SO LUCKY: 20 yards from the drill surface his
      chute gets SNARED IN THE CABLES, JERKING him upside down -- the
      WIND is so intense Sulu is BLOWN SIDEWAYS -- his CHUTE LINES
      begin RUBBING on the sharp metal of the suspension rig! Kirk
      holds on to one of the chute's cables -- yells up:

                                 KIRK (CONT'D)
                   I'M COMING FOR YOU!

      As Kirk tries to climb up, Sulu's cables begin to SNAP! ONE BY
      ONE -- and Sulu tries to CLIMB BACK using his chute cables,
      toward the rig -- otherwise he's gonna fly off.

      As Kirk makes his way up the rig, suddenly:

                                  SULU
                   BEHIND YOU!!

      Kirk SPINS just as a Romulan appears -- tackling Kirk to the
      drill platform! The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE
      SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING -- and suddenly there's
      ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE -
      - JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our
      Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death -- and
      Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER --
      fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault
      even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to
      KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as --

      KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan,
      knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to
      his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls --

      Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH --
      OPEN IT -- as:

      Pike's SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS. Pike steps out. Surrounded by a
      dozen of Nero's men. Ayel steps forward. Pike stands firm,
      knowing this is the end for him:

                               PIKE
                 I'm Captain Christopher Pi--

      WHACK! He's cut off by a PUNCH to the face. Drops to his
      knees. Looks up at Ayel with blazing eyes, wipes a trickle of
      blood from his lip:

                               PIKE (CONT'D)
                 So much for diplomacy.

      He's DRAGGED AWAY as --

      Kirk and Sulu DROP IN through the outer hatch to find a control
      console, Sulu madly flips switches, no luck --

                                SULU
                 None of this is familiar-- the interface,
                 the controls--

                   KIRK                              SULU
      Step back--                       -- what, you have an idea?

      Kirk FIRES his PHASER at the console, BLASTING IT --

                   want to know what they're doing to the

      Kirk and Sulu pull themselves from the control cockpit back out
      onto the drill's outer hull, they start to hear a SOUND... A
      HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK... GETTING LOUDER AS IT FALLS TOWARD THEM...
      THEY LOOK UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE: THE RED MATTER POD RIP RIGHT
      PAST THEM -- SNAP-TILT DOWN WITH IT AS IT PLUMMETS TOWARD
      VULCAN'S SURFACE, DISAPPEARING INTO THE DRILLED GAPING HOLE --

      And for an instant... nothing. What looks like a puff of smoke
      billowing up from the planet's core... THEN A SHOCKWAVE BLASTS
      UPWARD, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DRILL AT 10,000 FEET -- KIRK AND
      SULU FEEL IT -- LOSE THEIR BALANCE, FIGHT FOR PURCHASE AS:

                                 KIRK

                   Keptin: gravitational sensors are off the
                   scale -- if my calculations are correct,
                   that pod they launched is creating a
                   singularity... that will consume the
                   planet.

      SPOCK'S STOIC FACE. WE GET ONLY A HINT OF THE WILD EMOTIONS
      STIRRING INSIDE HIM -- Uhura watches Spock, heartsick for him:

                   They're creating a black hole... at the

                   they're tasked with protecting our
                   cultural history. My parents will be

      and knowing what he must do, he RUNS AND JUMPS --

      KIRK FALLS FAST, he's only gonna have one shot at this, presses
      his arms to his sides and ROCKETS downward, building speed, four
      hundred feet below is Sulu, FREEFALLING --

      KIRK moves his feet and hands, angling toward him -- slashing
      downward at 160 mph, closing like a missile -- the gap between
      them narrows -- Sulu's 30 feet below him... 5000 feet to the
      planet surface. 40 ft -- 20 -- 10 -- WHAM! Kirk slams into
      Sulu in a mid-air tackle -- they TUMBLE TOGETHER -- Kirk's made
      the grab and locked his arms around Sulu in an iron grip,
      screams in his face:

                                 SPOCK
                   Step aside -- I'm going to the surface.

      As the console ENGINEER works the display --

                                 KIRK
                   The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN
                   THERE? Are you nuts?!

                                 SPOCK
                   Energize --

      And Spock DEMATERIALIZES --

142   EXT. VULCAN - DAY                                                 142

      PUSH IN as Spock MATERIALIZES -- the distant landscape around
      him COLLAPSING, IMPLODING, EXPLODING -- he sprints for the
      MOUNTAIN -- the entrance to the ARK -- a scared, small CREATURE
      runs past Spock as he heads up the mountain -- rocks falling --

143   INT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - DAY                                   143

      Spock RACES through the tunnels as the world SHAKES around him --
      he enters the massive ARK CHAMBER -- sees, atop the enormous
      stairs, FIVE VULCAN ELDERS, Sarek among them, hands placed on
      the sarcophagus-like ark. Mind melding with it. Amanda is here
      too, kneeling beside Sarek -- and she sees her son, who is now
      RUNNING toward them -- she stands:

                                   AMANDA
                 Spock--!

      Spock rushes up the stairs --

                               SPOCK
                 The planet's not safe, it has only
                 seconds left -- we must evacuate now --

      And as they run out, ENORMOUS ROCKS COLLAPSE AROUND THEM -- and
      they run through the tunnels, the STONE COLLAPSING AROUND THEM --

144   EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY                                      144

      Spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see --
      THE PLANET IS COLLAPSING, COMING TOWARD THEM -- Spock whips
      open a tri-corder, TREMBLING LIKE CRAZY --

                               SPOCK
                 Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!

145   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS   [SET CHANGE] 145

146   EXT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS                            146

      HORROR AS THE WORLD LITERALLY STARTS TO FALL APART AROUND SPOCK,
      HIS PARENTS AND THE FIVE ELDERS -- MASSIVE SINKHOLES APPEARING,
      LIKE THE GRAND CANYON RACING FOR THEM -- AND WE SEE IN ALL THEIR
      FACES -- THE BELIEF THAT THEIR PLANET -- THAT THEY -- ARE GOING
      TO DIE -- and Spock, trying to hold it together -- even though
      their transport hasn't yet begun -- looks at Amanda -- their
      eyes lock -- THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM -- and in
      a surreal, intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly:

                                AMANDA
                 It's okay.   To be scared.

      PUSH IN ON SPOCK, looking at her -- as the LIGHT DARTS start
      TRACING THEM -- and they begin to EVAPORATE AS THE GROUND DROPS
      FROM UNDER AMANDA -- AND SHE'S SUCKED DOWN -- AWAY -- as Spock
      REACHES FOR HER, CALLING OUT --

                   NO!!!   I'M LOSING HER!!!

      -- as the Vulcans MATERIALIZE on the pad, Spock still REACHING
      for his mother -- but all he gets it the GHOSTLY IMAGE OF HER --
      BEAUTIFUL, HOLDING, FROZEN IN SPACE -- AN IMAGE HE'LL BE HAUNTED
      BY FOREVER -- AS IT FADES AWAY, EVANESCING LIKE MIST -- ON SPOCK
      as it lands -- Sarek too... a mother... a wife... has been lost.
      And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without
      anything to do or say... there's no cheating death.

148   EXT. SPACE - ETERNAL NIGHT                                       148

      And the Enterprise BLASTS AWAY -- in the distance, THE ENTIRE
      PLANET OF VULCAN SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF -- A TERRIFYING,
      UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION -- UNTIL NOTHING IS THERE BUT DARKNESS.
      And over this we HEAR:

                                 SPOCK (V.O.)
                   Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42:

151   INT. ENTERPRISE - SICK BAY - CONTINUOUS                          151

      SHOCK. The kind that crashes after the world's changed. In
      triage, the bay's filled with wounded Enterprise Officers. The
      Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here,
      getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks
      up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound --
      her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage...

                                 SPOCK (V.O.)
                   We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I
                   have therefore classified him a hostage
                   of the war criminal known as Nero.

151A INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                          151A

      Spock sits in the captain's chair, reporting. He's glassy-eyed,
      staring at nothing as he speaks. Behind him, Uhura sits,
      watching, concerned.

                                SPOCK
                 Nero, who has destroyed my home planet.
                 And most of its six billion inhabitants.
                 I estimate no more than ten thousand
                 survived.
                         (beat)
                 While the essence of our culture has been
                 saved, in the elders who now reside upon
                 this ship... I am now a member of an
                 endangered species.

      Spock considers this. Clicks off the log recorder.     Spock moves
      off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him --

152   INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS                                      152

      Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to
      say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of
      his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does
      something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she
      wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just
      holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and
      comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the
      intimacy before -- this is their secret...

                                  UHURA
                 I'm so sorry.

      Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost...

                                  UHURA (CONT'D)
                 What can I do?     Tell me what you need.

                                  SPOCK
                 ... I need...

      He's on the verge of some emotional release... but self-
      consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again:

                               SPOCK (CONT'D)
                 I need for us all to continue performing
                 admirably.

      He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens
      and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her.

                                             81


152A INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR                                        152A

      Kirk comes down the hall, stretching his hand bandage -- when he
      stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a
      DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him.
      After a beat he moves to her. Awkward.

                                   KIRK
                 Hey.
                         (she turns to him)
                 Listen, about what happened at Starfleet.
                 The test and everything-- I know it looks
                 like I was... using you, or whatever.
                 And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I
                 just hope you'll forgive me.

      She just stares at him for a long beat, as if she's just pissed.
      But Kirk's face changes... and then he says:

                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                 ... you're not Gaila, are you?

                                NOT GAILA
                          (pissed)
                 No.

                          (nods)
                 Sorry.

      And he walks off.   (NOTE: ALT. VERSION HAS GAILA SAYING, "I'M
      NOT GAILA.")

153   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            153

      Uhura at her station, scanning for enemy signals -- all of our
      principals are here, in debate:

                               SPOCK
                 Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero
                 is headed for Earth?

                               UHURA
                 Their trajectory suggests no other
                 destination, Captain.

                               KIRK
                 Earth may be his next stop, but we have
                 to assume every Federation planet's a
                 target.

                               CHEKOV
                 Yes, agreed-- but why didn't they destroy
                 us?

                   That's not it.     He said he wanted me to
                   see something.     The destruction of my
                   home planet.

                                  MCCOY
                   And how the hell did they do that by the
                   way? When did they jump so far ahead in
                   the arms race?

                                 SPOCK
                   The engineering comprehension necessary
                   to artificially create a black hole may
                   suggest the answer: such technology could
                   theoretically be manipulated to create a
                   tunnel through space time.

                                 MCCOY
                   Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a
                   physicist -- are you suggesting they're
                   from the future?

                                 KIRK
                   That is what he's suggesting and I don't
                   buy it.

                                 SPOCK
                   If you eliminate the impossible, whatever
                   remains -- however improbable -- must be
                   the truth.

                                    MCCOY
                   How poetic.

                                 KIRK
                   Then what would an angry future Romulan
                   want with Captain Pike?

                   As Admiral he knows details of

                 by the time we've "gathered", it'll be
                 too late -- how many planets are you
                 willing to risk? You say he's from the
                 future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then
                 the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

                               SPOCK
                 You're assuming Nero knows how events are
                 predicted to unfold. The contrary:
                 Nero's very presence has altered the flow
                 of history, beginning with the attack on
                 the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the
                 events of today -- thereby creating a new
                 chain of incidents that cannot be

                 Laurentian system, Warp Factor Three--

      -- wait-- don't do that --
      Spock -- running back to the
      rest of the fleet for a confab

      backwards, away from the
      problem, instead of hunting         -- then I must remove you from
      Nero down!                          this ship. If I confine you
                                          to the brig, you'll likely
                                          escape. Mr. Chekov: have

      For a beat, nobody moves -- an impossible choice for all of
      them. Torn, Chekov and Sulu close in on Kirk --

      Pike looks up at him -- quiet rage.   Then --

                 Where I come from, Christopher... this
                 ship is just a mining vessel. I chose a
                 life of honest labor to provide for
                 myself... and the wife who was carrying

                 Not just of today. But of tomorrow. I

                 They let us burn to death... as our
                 planet broke in half.

      Curiosity behind Pike's eyes.

                               PIKE
                 Then Nero, you're confused. Romulus has
                 not been destroyed. How can you blame
                 the Federation for something that hasn't
                 happened--?

                 years I forgot the sound of my own
                 voice... but I didn't forget the pain.

      Pike just looks at him.   Sees how fucking far GONE he is.

                               PIKE
                 If what you say is true... you can save
                 Romulus. You have a second chance to --

                         (beat)
                 ... but to create a Romulus which exists,
                 free of the Federation. Only then will
                 she be saved.

      And the "she" could refer to the planet... or to Nero's lost
      love. Either way, Pike knows a losing battle when he's fighting
      one. Ever so nobly, he quietly says --

                               PIKE
                 Then we have nothing more to discuss.

      Nero reaches for something under the counter Pike lies upon.
      Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF
      CENTAURIAN SLUGS, the very ones used on Nero.

                               NERO
                 It's not the fault of the human race that
                 Starfleet chose Earth as its center.
                 You're a more noble race than my fallen
                 cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your
                 extinction.

                               PIKE
                 How reassuring.

      Nero opens the container, reaches for a pair of TONGS

      like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S

      then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an
      eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's
      a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk.
      It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and
      the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the
      POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN
      SUDDENLY --

      WHATEVER WAS BENEATH THE ICE EARLIER EXPLODES UP THROUGH IT --
      IT'S NEARLY 30 FEET TALL, RED, HUNDREDS OF EYES -- IT SMACKS THE

      BACK -- HOLY SHIT! THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS
      KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING --

      KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE
      FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE
      SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and
      ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature
      starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense
      creature TUMBLING not far behind!

      And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks
      up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk
      tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets
      footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature
      LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it
      pursues Kirk --

      Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes

      BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone.

      IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the

      he doesn't recognize him...

                   Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.

      Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't
      that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating:

      Firelight flickers -- shadows of Kirk and Spock Prime dance on
      the ice walls. Remarkable NIGHT STARS outside.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   It's remarkably pleasing to see you
                   again.
                           (re: Vulcan)
                   ... especially after the events of today.

                                 KIRK
                   Old friend. Sir, I don't have any idea
                   how you know what you know. But I don't
                   know you and if you are Spock we're not
                   friends. You hate me. You marooned me
                   here for mutiny...

                                  SPOCK PRIME
                   Mutiny?   You are not the Captain?

                                 KIRK
                   You're the captain.   Pike was taken
                   hostage.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (realizing, grave)
                   ... by Nero.

                                 KIRK
                   What do you know about him?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (guilty, burdened)

                                 SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                  troubled Romulan.
                          (then)
                  ... Please. Allow me -- it will be
                  easier--

      Spock Prime reaches for Kirk's face -- Kirk grabs his wrist --

                                KIRK
                  What're you doing--?

      A skeptical beat, but Kirk finally releases his hand. Spock
      gently places his fingers on Kirk's cheek and temple --

                                SPOCK PRIME
                          (whispering; a mantra)
                  Our minds... one and together...One
                  hundred and twenty-seven years from now
                  everything ends.

      Spock's eyes SNAP SHUT, Kirk JOLTS as if by an electric charge --
      and the SCREEN OVEREXPOSES TO WHITE as we CUT TO our MIND MELD
      SEQUENCE:

162   EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                               162

      A SUPERNOVA. An EXPLODING STAR, like a LIGHT, EATING AWAY AT
      ALL AROUND IT --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova
                  -- and like a cancer left untreated... it
                  will grow... and destroy everything.

162A INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY                                     162A

      Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULCAN
      SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's ORIGIN,
      its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan
                  Science Academy devised a plan to stop
                  it.

162B EXT. VULCAN SHIPYARD - NIGHT                                    162B

      PUSH IN as the JELLYFISH SHIP is under construction --

                                               92
162B CONTINUED:                                                      162B

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  We built a ship containing a material
                  capable of generating the only thing
                  powerful enough to consume a supernova.
                  A black hole.

163   INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD - NIGHT                        163

      Now we're INSIDE the ship -- the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- being
      ASSEMBLED by Vulcan Scientists --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I
                  would not return.

164   Now we see Spock Prime, in a ritual ceremony of a Vulcan         164
      Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  My sacrifice, in service of all races,
                  seemed only logical.

      Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  Unfortunately... before I could begin the
                  mission... the supernova destroyed
                  Romulus.

165   OMIT                                                             165

166   -- and suddenly we're OUT OF THE MIND MELD as KIRK GRABS SPOCK   166
      PRIME'S HAND AGAIN:

                                KIRK
                  Nero's planet was destroyed--

                                SPOCK PRIME
                  Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed
                  Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which
                  was hardly the case. Let me continue.

                   KIRK                           SPOCK PRIME
      This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm not
      it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you complain
      this--?                           -- allow me to finish.

      Spock Prime touches Kirk again and we go:

                                            93


167   EXT. SPACE                                                     167

      -- the JELLYFISH SWOOPS PAST US -- and we PAN -- and see the
      MASSIVE SUPERNOVA in the infinite distance -- no sense of scale
      here -- but then -- THE NARADA APPEARS -- FIRES TORPEDOES at the
      Jellyfish.

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   Nero came after me. Determined to thwart
                   my mission. If Romulus was allowed to
                   die, he said... all planets should share
                   its fate.

167A SPOCK PRIME IN THE COCKPIT, ROCKED AS TORPEDOES EXPLODE         167A
     CLOSELY. TIGHT ON SPOCK PRIME AS HIS MIND RACES --

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   I needed an exit. I knew if this mission
                   failed... everyone, everywhere... would
                   lose everything.

      Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit --

167B INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD                               167B

      Prime ENTERS AN AIRLOCK -- TUMBLES IN WEIGHTLESSNESS and enters
      THE CONTAINMENT ROOM. QUICK CUTS as he REMOVES RED MATTER FROM
      THE HOLD --

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   I realized: a large black hole could
                   destroy the supernova. A smaller one...
                   could be my escape. Could send me back
                   in time, allowing me to complete my
                   mission. So I created a black hole...

      Spock loads the CANNISTER with a small amount of RED MATTER into
      a JETTISON TUBE --

167C EXT. JELLYFISH - SPACE - NIGHT                                  167C

      -- and he FIRES THE CANNISTER INTO SPACE --

167D EXT. JELLYFISH - COCKPIT - NIGHT                                167D

      Spock Prime back in the cockpit -- takes aim on his controls and
      FIRES AT THE CANNISTER --

167E EXT. JELLYFISH/NARADA - SPACE - NIGHT                           167E

      A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED -- Spock Prime PILOTS TOWARD THE HOLE --

                                               94
167E CONTINUED:                                                      167E

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  Nero must have understood what I was
                  trying to do. Because he began racing
                  for it.

      The NARADA and the JELLYFISH aiming for the BLACK HOLE --

167F OMIT                                                             167F

167G INT. JELLYFISH - COCKPIT - NIGHT                                 167G

      Spock Prime watches as the NARADA GOES IN -- LIGHTNING STORM-
      STYLE DISAPPEARING FIRST -- then SPOCK PRIME'S FACE -- WHITE
      WITH LIGHTNING -- OVEREXPOSED --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  Nero simply got to it first. How long I
                  was travelling... I couldn't tell you.
                  It was timeless. But when I arrived...

      LIGHT on Spock Prime's face goes away -- he and the Jellyfish
      are back in SPACE --

168-9 OMIT                                                          168-9

      -- but now, facing him, is the NARADA.

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  Nero was waiting for me.

171-3 OMIT                                                          171-3

      KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime.    Back
      to the two men, in a cave:

      Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he
      believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional.

                                SPOCK PRIME
                  Forgive me... emotional transference is
                  an effect of the mind meld.

                                           95
174   CONTINUED:                                                    174

                                 KIRK
                           (sympathy, surprise)
                   ... so you do feel...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   "Cthia" is the stricture that binds our
                   emotions... but few of us are that
                   perfectly Vulcan.

      Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve...

                                 KIRK
                   Going back in time... you changed all our
                   lives.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Yet remarkably, events within our
                   timelines, characteristics, people...
                   seem to overlap significantly. Tell me
                   about the rest of the crew? Chekov--
                   Uhura --?

                                 KIRK
                   Tactical and Communications --

                                 SPOCK PRIME

                                 KIRK
                   -- he's the helmsman, why?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here
                   is not a matter of coincidence... but
                   rather, indication of a higher purpose.

                                 KIRK
                   ... he'd call it a damn miracle.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's
                   way of attempting to mend itself. In
                   both our histories, the same crew found
                   its way onto the same ship in a time of
                   ultimate crisis -- therein lies our
                   advantage.
                           (rises)
                   We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost
                   not far from here.

      But Kirk stands -- stops him:

                                            96
174   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 174

                               KIRK
                 Where you came from... did I know my
                 father?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 ... yes. You often spoke of him as your
                 inspiration for joining starfleet.

      This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that
      life. Spock intuits what this means.

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 You should know. He proudly lived to see
                 you become captain of the Enterprise.

                                KIRK
                 ... Captain?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 A ship we must return you to as soon as
                 possible.

                 Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk
                 is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as
                 you did, must have been difficult.

                               MCCOY
                 ... are you thanking me?

                               SPOCK
                 I'm simply acknowledging your
                 difficulties.

      We're not sure how McCoy is taking this...

                  Do you. Okay then: are you out of your
                  Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical
                  thing? Maybe. The right one?
                  Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure
                  -- that kid doesn't know how to lose.
                  Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have
                  a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the
                  Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize
                  stallion in the stable."

                                SPOCK
                  ... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a
                  stallion must first be broken before it
                  can reach its potential.

                                MCCOY
                  My God, Man... you could at least act
                  like it was a hard decision.

                                SPOCK
                  I intended to assist in the effort to re-
                  establish communication with Starfleet.
                  However, if crew morale would be better
                  served by my roaming the halls weeping,
                  I'll gladly defer to your medical
                  expertise.

      A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.
      Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming --

174C EXT. DELTA VEGA - PLANET SURFACE - DAY                           174C

      A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the
      maddening whiteout.   Kirk yells through it:

                                KIRK
                  I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT
                  NOW!

      And Spock POINTS -- an OUTPOST -- half a mile away.

175   INT. STARFLEET OUTPOST - DAY                                     175

      Long tile corridor. The door at the end opens -- SNOW AND WIND
      as Kirk and Spock Prime enter. Door closes. Silence again.

                   ... hello?!

      Echo. Nothing. They head down. After a beat, a SMALL, DARK,
      ODDLY ALIEN CREATURE STEPS OUT. Eyes them curiously. This is
      KEENSER.

                                 KEENSER
                   ... can I help you?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Are you the station chief?

      Keenser looks them over.    Then:

                                  KEENSER
                   ... no.   This way.

      And they follow Keenser into a MASSIVE WAREHOUSE, filled mostly
      with junked space parts. A large, tarped SHUTTLE in the
      background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a
      table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up,
      leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps
      the Officer's boot.

                                  STARFLEET OFFICER
                   Hm.

      A beat -- and the Officer peers from under his hat.     A cool,
      slow burn.

                                 STARFLEET OFFICER
                   You realize how unacceptable this is.

                                  KIRK

      Officer stands, unhappy about something. Keeser watches nearby --

                   I'm sure it's no' your fault, and I know

                 Six months I've been living on nothing
                 but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the
                 promise of a real food delivery! Six
                 months, boys! It's pretty clear what's
                 going on here, isn't it? Punishment!
                 Ongoing! For something that was clearly
                 an accident!

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 You're Montgomery Scott.

                 right place-- are there any other hard-
                 working and equally-starving Starfleet
                 officers around?

                                 KEENSER
                 Me.

                               SCOTTY
                 You eat nothing. A bean and you're done
                 for a week, I need food. And now you're
                 here -- so. Thank you. Where is it.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 You are in fact the Mr. Scott who
                 postulated the theory of trans-warp
                 beaming.

                               SCOTTY
                 Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking
                 about! How d'ya think I ended up here?
                 I got into a debate with my instructor on
                 the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
                 pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
                 to think that the range of transporting
                 say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
                 hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
                 I could not only beam a bird from one
                 planet to an adjacent planet in the same
                 system -- which is no big deal anyway --
                 but if I were so inclined I could
                 actually do it with a lifeform! So I
                 tested it on Admiral Archer's prize
                 beagle. Which... was a mistake.

                               KIRK
                 I know that dog. What happened to it?

                 I'll tell ya when it reappears.     Dunno.
                 Feel guilty.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 What if I told you your trans-warp theory
                 was correct? That it is indeed possible
                 to beam onto a ship that is travelling at
                 warp speed. And that you only required
                 the correct field equation to
                 recrystallize dilithium?

                               SCOTTY
                 I haven't been stationed here that long.
                 If such an equation had been discovered,
                 I'da heard.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr.
                 Scott... is because you haven't
                 discovered it yet.

      Kirk reacts. Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a
      bit... really regards Spock Prime. Skeptical. Amused.

                               SCOTTY
                 Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant.

                 will show you what a genius you actually

                   Your equation for achieving trans-warp
                   beaming.

      Scotty looks at the equations -- we watch his expression run the
      gamut: from confused, to dumbfounded, to quiet awe and delight:

                                 SCOTTY
                   Imagine that! Never occurred to me to
                   think of space as the part that's moving.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Point of fact: it did occur to you.
                           (he works the console)
                   Extrapolating Enterprise's course --

                                 SCOTTY
                   -- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage
                   already, has it? Well, you must've done
                   something right to be assigned to that
                   ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady --
                   love to get my hands on her ample
                   nacelles, if you'll pardon the
                   engineering parlance.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.

                                 SCOTTY
                   Look, even if I believed you -- where
                   you're from, what I've done-- which I
                   don't -- we're still talkin' bout
                   slingshotting aboard while she's going
                   faster than light. Without a proper
                   receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a
                   bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a
                   blindfold. On a horse.

                                 SPOCK
                   I calculate no more than a four meter
                   margin of error.

                                 SCOTTY
                   That's all well and good unless you
                   rematerialize four meters outside the
                   ship.

                 one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero,
                 you alone must take command of your ship.

                               KIRK
                 How, over your dead body?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Preferably not. There is, however,
                 Starfleet Regulation 619.
                         (off Kirk's confusion)
                 Yes. I forget what little regard you had
                 for such things. 619 states that any
                 commanding officer who is emotionally
                 compromised by the mission at hand...
                 must resign said command.

                               KIRK
                 So I need to emotionally compromise you?

                                SPOCK PRIME
                 Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell
                 you.  I am emotionally compromised.
                         (then)

                 A trick I learned from an old friend.

      Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. Spock
      responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what Kirk
      must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legendary
      Vulcan salute:

                 Live long, and prosper.

      the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish --

179   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING BAY - CONTINUOUS                  179

      Amid the ROAR of the ship's plasma drives, PARTICLES
      rematerialize... it's KIRK, eyes wide in suspense. He looks
      down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in
      one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT
      SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the
      BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears
      in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR
      METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save
      his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the
      tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE!

                                 KIRK
                 -- no-- shit!

      And Kirk runs after him -- down the length of the ORANGE,
      TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a
      CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes
      -- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks --
      FOLLOWS THE LENGTH OF TUBE -- SEEING WHERE IT'S HEADING -- TO A
      GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER.

      And Kirk HAULS ASS to the control panel -- we see the huge
      machine -- overhead, the RELEASE VALVE under the pipe -- and
      Kirk works as fast as he can --

      Chekov brings up TWO DOZEN SECURITY VIDEO IMAGES ON ONE SCREEN.
      Spock points to one -- it ENLARGES -- and we see KIRK AND SCOTTY
      racing through the ship -- Spock's eyes narrow -- he moves to
      the Captain's chair -- hits comm:

      Kirk, AT THE PANEL, accesses the RELEASE VALVE CONTROL -- he
      watches Scotty disappear through a CLEAR SECTION -- Kirk times
      it -- waiting -- then he HITS THE BUTTON and Scotty DROPS
      THROUGH THE RELEASE VALVE AND SLAMS TO THE FLOOR -- hurt, wet,
      but BREATHING, deeply --

                                  KIRK

      Kirk and wet Scotty race through the ship -- only to finally
      turn a corner and be faced with PHASERS, AIMED RIGHT AT THEM.

      But suddenly PHASERS are at their heads. Two SECURITY GUARDS --
      one, THE GUY HE GOT INTO THE FIGHT WITH AT THE BAR, YEARS AGO.

                                  SECURITY OFFICER #1
                 Come with me.     Moon Beam.

      Off Kirk -- shit --

184   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE    [SET CHANGE]                         184

      WOOSH -- bridge doors open -- Kirk and Scotty are ushered in by
      the Security Guards. Spock moves to them, containing his anger
      and dismay. McCoy is here as well. Spock walks right up to
      Kirk... raises his eyebrow.

                                  KIRK
                 Surprise.

                               SPOCK
                         (to Scotty)
                 Who are you?

                                  KIRK
                 He's with me.

                                 SPOCK
                   We're travelling at warp -- how did you
                   manage to get aboard this ship?

      Kirk stares at the young Spock -- a different experience now --

                                 KIRK
                   You're the genius, you figure it out.

                                 SPOCK
                   As Captain of this vessel I order you to
                   answer the question.

                                  KIRK
                   Well I'm not telling.
                           (then)
                   Captain.

      HUH.   That confounds Spock.   And Kirk is off to the races --

                                 KIRK (CONT'D)
                   Does that frustrate you? My lack of
                   cooperation... does it make you angry?

      Spock again focuses on Scotty --

                                 SPOCK
                   You are not a member of this ship's crew.
                   Under penalty of court martial, I order
                   you to explain to me how you beamed ab --

                                 KIRK
                           (to Scotty)
                   -- Don't answer him.

                                 SPOCK
                   You will answer me.

      ON SCOTTY.   Weighing all this.     Then --

                                 SCOTTY
                   I'd rather not take sides.

      Spock nods back to the SECURITY GUARDS, over this --

                                 SPOCK
                   Escort them to the Brig.

      But before the guards can do so --

                                 KIRK
                   What is it about you, Spock? Your planet
                   was just destroyed -- your mother
                   murdered -- and you're not even upset?

                                            107
184   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  184

                               SPOCK
                 Your presumption that these experiences
                 interfere with my abilities to command
                 this ship is inaccurate--

                               KIRK
                 HA! And yet you said fear was necessary
                 for command. I mean -- did you see that
                 bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?

                               SPOCK
                         (tense)
                 Yes, of course I--

                               KIRK
                 So are you afraid or aren't you?!?

                               SPOCK
                         (tenser)
                 I will not... allow you to lecture me
                 about the merits of emotion.

      Kirk gets close to Spock --

                               KIRK
                 Then why don't you stop me.

      Sarek watches, tense.   McCoy, too.   Spock blinks --

                               SPOCK
                 Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

                               KIRK
                 What is it like? Not to feel? Anger.
                 Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at
                 nothing to avenge the death of the woman
                 who gave birth to you?!

                               SPOCK
                         (volcanic)
                 -- back away --

                               KIRK
                         (closer still)
                 You must not feel anything! It must not
                 even compute for you! You must not have
                 loved her at all--!

      -- WHAM! SPOCK HAS JUST HIT KIRK -- and Kirk goes to hit back,
      but Spock fucking DELIVERS A SERIES OF POWERFUL BLOWS --
      Security stand back as the Captain attacks...

      And Spock is now fucking CHOKING Kirk -- HE SLAMS KIRK AGAINST
      THE WALL -- SPOCK'S CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

                  Spock!

      And everything -- everything -- STOPS. Spock, red-faced,
      releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground.
      Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to
      collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression
      isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.

      Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But
      worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.
      Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of
      dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --

                                SPOCK
                  Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I
                  hereby relinquish my command on the
                  grounds that I have been... emotionally
                  compromised. Please note the time and
                  date in the ship's log.

      JESUS. Spock just... QUIT. And after a beat, he leaves the
      room. Sarek follows a moment later.

      The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE.   Finally --

                                SCOTTY
                  I like this ship. It's exciting.

      McCoy turns to Kirk, exasperated --

                                MCCOY
                  Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no
                  Captain and no first officer to goddamn
                  replace him.

      ON KIRK.   The moment is upon him.

                                 KIRK
                  Yeah we do.

      ON MCCOY. The CREW -- confused. Sulu just fucking POINTS at
      Kirk and they all realize HOLY SHIT -- Pike made KIRK the First
      Officer before he left!

      And Kirk moves to the captain's chair, passing Uhura:

                    you were all expecting to regroup with

                   Then we find a way to get on that ship
                   and steal the black hole device away from

      SPOCK stand here, staring at the place where his mother should
      have, but didn't, arrive. Sarek enters. Sees his son. They're
      alone for the first time in ages. A beat:

                   You must not punish yourself.
                           (beat)
                   Speak your mind, Spock.

                                 SPOCK
                   That would be unwise.

                                 SAREK
                   What is necessary is always wise.

      Watch Spock's face.   Struggling with what's pent-up inside...

                                 SPOCK
                   I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a
                   child. Have I made so little progress?

                                 SAREK
                           (beat, softly)
                   You will always be a child of two worlds.
                   I am grateful for that. And for you.
                           (painfully)
                   And not only because you are all I have
                   left of her.

      Spock looks at Sarek.   This is as close to emotion as he'll get.

                                 SPOCK
                   I feel anger. For the one who took her
                   life. An anger I cannot stop.

                                  SAREK
                   I believe she would say... do not try to.
                           (then)
                   You asked me once. Why I married your
                   mother.
                           (beat, simply)
                   I married her because I loved her.

      Their look HOLDS -- and for Spock, a revelation...

189   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                         189

      -- the strategy session continues in FULL SWING -- now Chekov,
      the youngest of the bunch, gets up the courage to chime in,
      incidently becoming the very first officer to say:

                                   CHEKOV
                   Keptin Kirk?    Excuse me, plees, could
                   I...?

      All eyes shift to the wonder-kid who awaits permission to speak:

                                 KIRK
                   Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask
                   permission to--

                                 CHEKOV
                   Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan,
                   I've projected that Nero will travel past
                   Saturn. If we could drop out of warp
                   behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,
                   the magnetic distortion from the planet's
                   rings will make us invisible to Nero's
                   sensors. We could follow him to Earth by
                   staying in his blind spot.

                                 KIRK
                   What blind spot?

                                 CHEKOV
                   Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our
                   shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect
                   us.

                                 MCCOY
                   Wait a minute-- anyone understand this
                   kid? How old are you?

                                 CHEKOV
                   I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?

                                 MCCOY
                   We're all old enough to shave here.

                                 SPOCK (O.S.)
                   Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.

      Everyone turns, surprised: SPOCK has entered the bay --
      galvanized, full of purpose --

                                 SPOCK (CONT'D)
                   I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr.
                   Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can
                   beam aboard Nero's ship.

                                 KIRK
                   I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.

                                 SPOCK
                   Romulans and Vulcans share a common
                   ancestry. Our cultural similarities will
                   make it easier for me to access their
                   ship's computer to locate the device.

                 See, we're getting to know each other.

      And a MOMENT -- a burgeoning friendship --

190   EXT. BARREN LANDSCAPE                                            190

      PANNING ACROSS AN ALIEN LANDSCAPE... and even though it's in
      shadow, you start to recognize it as THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.
      OUR POV ascends now to see:

      THE ENTERPRISE DROPS OUT OF WARP IN THE DEAD SILENCE OF SPACE...

      And we move past it, along the orbit of the moon, cresting the
      horizon to see EARTH -- AND NERO'S SHIP HOVERING ABOVE IT.

191   INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - NIGHT                                     191

      CLOSE ON NERO -- his face illuminated on the DARKENED BRIDGE of
      the Narada by SOFT BLUE LIGHT. Light radiated by EARTH. A
      BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as
      those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero
      tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE
      WEAPON. Strong. Tough. But under it all... terrified.

                                AYEL
                 The men and I have discussed this. What
                 we are about to do.
                         (beat)
                 We have to turn the ship around. We can
                 save our home.

      Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses:

                               AYEL (CONT'D)
                 Stop.

      Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more
      nervous as he faces his master. The surrounding crew stare on,
      frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift
      mutiny with scared looks.

                                                  113

                                 AYEL (CONT'D)
                   We can go back. That's what we want. We
                   have taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No
                   more. We want to go home now.

      Nero considers this... nods gently.

                                  NERO
                   There is no need, Ayel.   To threaten me.
                           (beat)
                   I understand.

      Ayel is massively relieved.     Nero gently reaches out, holds the
      staff (still aimed at him).     He deactivates it -- the blades
      instantly RETRACT.

                                   NERO (CONT'D)
                   I understand.    But you are wrong.

      And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates
      the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON
      THE OTHER END -- THE END NOW FACING AYEL -- AND JUST AS AYEL'S
      EYES GO WIDE -- NERO THRUSTS THE BLADES INTO AYEL -- WHO FALLS
      TO THE FLOOR, DEAD! Nero's hard face turns to the rest of his
      crew.

                                 NERO (CONT'D)
                   We will return to Romulus when the
                   Federation lies in ruins and not a moment
                   before. When those who watched our
                   people burn at last understand our pain,
                   our loss. I refuse to return as a slave!
                   We will return as conquerors!

      ON THE FACES OF THE MEN, SUBMITTING TO HIS WILL, our MUSIC
      BUILDING -- and then, his eyes on Earth like a fucking LION eyes
      a gazelle--

                                 NERO (CONT'D)
                   Deploy the drill.

      For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until
      they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan,
      struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a
      nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the
      Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally
      knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL
      OVER --

                   I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of
                   Suus Mahna.

      Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles
      to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples.

                                 SPOCK (CONT'D)
                   I am unable to meld with these Romulans --
                   there are subtle differences in their
                   physiology I did not anticipate --

                   KIRK                                SPOCK
      -- punch him in the face --
      make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended
      ass!                                for self-defense, he's no
                                          longer a threat --
      -- then pretend it's a threat -
      - I'm your captain, that's an
      order!

      Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink
      translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN:

      A ROTATING SHIP SCHEMATIC -- Spock typing at a console,
      searching -- accesses two inter-cam windows: on one, SPOCK
      PRIME'S SHIP, THE JELLYFISH -- in a lower containment hold -- on
      the other: PIKE, unclear if he's dead or alive.

      Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life:

                               COMPUTER VOICE
                 Voice print and face recognition analysis
                 enabled.

                               KIRK
                 Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone.

                               SPOCK
                 Which may be problematic, as I am
                 unfamiliar with this ship's design.

      THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for
      ID -- THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY MATERIALIZES:

                               COMPUTER VOICE
                 Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.

                          (awkwardly)
                 Wow.   That's weird.

      He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden
      understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all
      the pieces start coming together...

                               SPOCK

                 Science Academy.

      Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset:

                               SPOCK
                 It appears you've been keeping rather
                 important information from me.

                                   KIRK
                 Just trust me.      Can ya do that?

      Spock weigh his options.     Trust.   Finally:

229   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY - CONTINUOUS                  229

      IT'S A RUSH, CRAZY, TENSE AS HELL --Uhura, McCoy, a MED TEAM and
      ND OFFICERS race in as Scotty finishes receiving incoming
      signals:

      KIRK, SPOCK... AND PIKE MATERIALIZE ON THE PAD:

                               KIRK
                         (to Transporter Chief)
                 Nice timing, Lieutenant --

                               SCOTTY
                 Never beamed two targets from two places
                 onto the same pad before! That was
                 pretty good!

      Kirk transfers Pike to McCoy, who urgently SCANS Pike and barks
      to a MED-TECH:

                               MCCOY
                 -- we're gonna need gastric stimulators,
                 let's prep him for surgery, now!

                   Hail them -- now!

      NERO appears on screen from the Narada bridge -- the Narada's on
      its last legs -- a beat before Nero TURNS, realizing Kirk's
      fucking GRINNING at him from the screen:

                                 KIRK (CONT'D)
                   This is Captain James T. Kirk of the
                   U.S.S. Enterprise -- your ship is
                   compromised -- too close to the
                   singularity to survive without assistance
                   -- which we are willing to provide.

                                 SPOCK
                           (sotto)
                   Captain -- what are you doing?

                                 KIRK
                           (sotto)
                   We show them compassion-- it may be the
                   only way to earn peace with Romulus.
                   It's logic, Spock! I thought you'd like
                   that.

                                 SPOCK
                   No, not really, not this time.

                                 NERO
                   I would rather suffer the death of
                   Romulus a thousand times than accept
                   assistance from you.

                                 KIRK
                   You got it.

      Leaving only the Enterprise -- its nacelles FLARE as the ship
      tries to make the quantum leap -- BUT: the black hole's now a
      TITANIC WHIRLPOOL so insanely strong that the Enterprise is held
      in place by the gravity well even at warp! IT SHAKES INTO A

      THE BLACK HOLE LIGHTS UP FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON, THE BLAST WAVE
      WHITING OUT THE FRAME! THE ENTERPRISE IS CONSUMED WITHIN IT:

      FOR A MINUTE, WE THINK IT'S GONE... UNTIL IT'S JETTISONED OUT

241   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - MEDICAL BAY/HANGAR - DAY                   241

      Spock is seen in a medical office with Pike, who lies in bed,
      recovering -- McCoy monitors him - Spock exits -- walks through
      the corridor -- sees a VULCAN in silhouette, staring out at the
      Academy. Sarek. Spock moves to him -- says quietly:

                                 SPOCK
                   Father...?

      Sarek turns -- but IT ISN'T SAREK.   IT'S SPOCK PRIME.     Who says:

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I am not... our father.

      An incredible beat, our two Spocks in eye lock... both minds
      processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate...
      surreal extensions of each other, separate but connected...

                                 SPOCK
                   ... Fascinating.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   There are so few Vulcans left.    We cannot
                   afford to ignore each other.

      Young Spock's eyes flicker in puzzlement...

                                 SPOCK
                   Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
                   you alone could've explained the truth?

                                            127
241   CONTINUED:                                                      241

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (beat, simply)
                   Because you needed each other. Opposing
                   yet complimentary opposites. It was that
                   balance between us -- I should say
                   you and Kirk -- that often made the
                   impossible, possible.

                                 SPOCK
                   ... it was a test?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (no: his heart heavy)
                   I'm in no position to pass judgment...
                   my actions have robbed you of much. I
                   could not also deprive you the revelation
                   of all you can accomplish together... of
                   a friendship that will define you both in
                   ways you cannot yet realize.

      There is, to young Spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.

                                 SPOCK
                   How did you persuade him to keep your
                   secret?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
                   would ensue should he break his promise.

                                  SPOCK
                   You lied.

                                  SPOCK PRIME
                   I implied.

                                  SPOCK
                   A gamble...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   An act of faith. One I hope you'll
                   repeat in the future.

      Young Spock considers an enduring friendship between him and
      Kirk... for the first time, understanding it. But --

                                 SPOCK
                   The future's not what it used to be... in
                   the face of extinction, it's only logical
                   I resign my Starfleet commission and help
                   rebuild our race.

                 you can be in two places at once.

                         (beat)
                 I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've
                 already located a suitable planet on
                 which to establish a Vulcan colony, and
                 assist in the foundation of a new science
                 academy.

      Young Spock takes that in, resolute...

                               SPOCK
                 My future cannot be determined by your
                 past. We are one, but not the same.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Then I ask that you do yourself a favor.
                 Put away logic. Do what feels right.
                 The world you've inherited lives in the
                 shadow of incalculable devastation... but
                 there's no reason you must face it alone.

      Spock Prime moves to the door, stops.    Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 As my customary farewell would appear
                 oddly self serving, I will simply say...
                 good luck.

      Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
      Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
      jumble of thoughts... and our MUSIC BUILDS...

      As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
      man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
      SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
      just passed him is... oddly familiar.

      past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
      absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   Your inspirational valor and supreme

                   you with a commendation for original
                   thinking.

      He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

                   By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
                   directed to report to Commanding Officer,
                   USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

      Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
      ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
      but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE:

                                 KIRK
                   I relieve you, Sir.

                                 PIKE
                   I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.

      Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.

                                 KIRK
                   Thank you, Sir.

      Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk
      rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK
      of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words.
      He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --

244   INT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     244

      The turbolift WHOOSHES open and in walks Kirk -- to every fan's
      delight, wearing his iconic GOLD SHIRT. All around him, our
      crew -- young and fresh-faced but no longer children -- in
      charge of the greatest starship ever built:

                           (wry grin)
                   Same ship, different day.

      And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console
      with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge
      feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.

                                 KIRK
                   Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus--

      WHOOSH: the turbolift door opens.      SPOCK!!!   Wearing his BLUE
      UNIFORM. Our hearts soar --

                                 SPOCK
                   Permission to come aboard, Captain.

                                 KIRK
                   ... Permission granted.

                                 SPOCK
                   As you have yet to select a first
                   officer, respectfully, I would like to
                   submit my candidacy. Should you desire,
                   I can provide character references.

      Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes
      between them... it carries acceptance, and trust...

                                 KIRK
                   It would be my honor, Commander.
                   Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.     Take us
                   out.

                                   SULU
                   Aye, Captain.

      As the ship maneuvers out of dry dock, Spock takes his place
      next to Kirk. Gold and blue, side by side.

245   EXT. STARBASE ONE - DRYDOCK - CONTINUOUS                            245

      And the ship crests the drydock portal, drifting into space...
      blessed one last time by the voice of our Vulcan hero:

                                SPOCK/NIMOY
                  Space... the final frontier. These are
                  the continuing voyages of the Starship

                  explore strange new worlds... to seek out
                  new life forms, and new civilizations...
                  To boldly go, where no one has gone...
                  before...

                   Sir, should we initiate an active scan?

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   That could be seen as an act of
                   provocation -- all readings passive--

      Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

                                 KELVIN CREW MEMBER
                   EM sensors in passive sweep...

      Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --

                         ALTERNATE SCENE B

                         SPOCK PRIME
           Then I ask that you do yourself a
           favor... put away logic, and do what
           feels right. The world you've inherited
           lives in the shadow of incalculable
           devastation... but there's no reason you
           must face it alone.

And from around his neck, he removes the PENDANT that until now,
we've only caught glimpses of. Places it on the table beside
his younger self. The feeling in his eyes is profound...

                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
           This was a gift to me.   Representing...
           a dream. One we were unable to fulfill.
                   (softly)
           The way you can now.

And moves to the door.    Stops.   Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
           As my customary farewell would appear
           oddly self serving, I will simply say...
           good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
jumble of thoughts. Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a
HOLO-EMITTER. After considering a beat, he hits an activation
button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him:

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. WILLIAM SHATNER.      As always, brash, wry,
confident -- and SINGING:

                         KIRK/ SHATNER
           Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to
           you...
                   (stops, grins)
           I know I know, it's illogical to
           celebrate something you had nothing to do
           with, but I haven't had the chance to
           congratulate you on your appointment to
           the ambassadorship so I thought I'd seize
           the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell
           me your first mission may take you away
           for awhile, so I'll be the first to wish
           you luck... and to say...
                   (beat, emotional)
           I miss you, old friend.

                                      136
CONTINUED: (3)

... and we're PUSHING IN on Young Spock, taking in the image of
Kirk's future self, the message, but above all -- the clear,
unquestionable friendship these two men had...

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
just passed him is... oddly familiar.

                         KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
           I suppose I'd always imagined us...
           outgrowing Starfleet together. Watching
           life swing us into our Emeritus years...

INT. STARBASE ONE - HANGAR - ETERNAL NIGHT

MUSIC BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at dock,
UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud:

                         KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
           I look around at the new cadets now and
           can't help thinking... has it really been
           so long? Wasn't it only yesterday we
           stepped onto the Enterprise as boys?
           That I had to prove to the crew I
           deserved command... and their respect?

And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, proud. A man.
And to every fan's delight, finally wearing his YELLOW SHIRT.
The FEDERATION COMMANDANT stands at a podium:

                         COMMANDANT
           This assembly calls Captain James
           Tiberius Kirk...

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

                         COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
           Your inspirational valor and supreme
           dedication to your comrades are in
           keeping with the highest traditions of
           service and reflect utmost credit to
           yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
           By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
           directed to report to Commanding Officer,
           USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

                                         137
CONTINUED:

Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE
each other:

                           KIRK
             I relieve you, Sir.

                           PIKE
             ... I am relieved.

He opens a BOX in his lap -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

                           PIKE (CONT'D)
             And as Fleet Admiral, for your... unique
             solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my
             honor to award you with a commendation
             for original thinking.

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest...

                           PIKE (CONT'D)
                     (a touch choked)
             Congratulations, Captain.

                           KIRK
             Thank you, Sir.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE.    OUR
MUSIC SOARS. Bones leans in to Sulu, rolling his eyes:

                           BONES
             ... Same ship, different day.

As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to
the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond
words. He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes...

                           KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
             I know what you'd say -- `It's their turn
             now, Jim...' And of course you're
             right... but it got me thinking:

INT. STARFLEET HOSPITAL - EARTH - DAY

Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk's transmission:

                            KIRK/SHATNER
             Who's to say we can't go one more round?
             By the last tally, only twenty five
             percent of the galaxy's been chartered...
             I'd call that negligent. Criminal even --
             an invitation.
                            (MORE)

                                       138
CONTINUED:
                           KIRK/SHATNER (CONT'D)
             You once said being a starship captain
             was my first, best destiny... if that's
             true, then yours is to be by my side. If
             there's any true logic to the universe...
             we'll end up on that bridge again
             someday.

Stops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most...

                           KIRK
             Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the
             journey itself... is home.

Young Spock's face.   Lost in feelings that flood through him.
