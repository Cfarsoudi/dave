                                       SEQUENCE "A"

               FADE IN:

               A-1 LOS ANGELES - A DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION

               It is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic.

               At the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore 
               traffic signal stands at GO. Approaching it at about thirty 
               miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically 
               and weaving a little, but not out of control.

               When the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to 
               STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through.

               A-2 A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCK

               is crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and 
               skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing 
               had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. 
               There is a large sign on the truck: "READ THE LOS ANGELES 
               TIMES". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the 
               coupe.

               A-3 THE COUPE

               continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down 
               and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office 
               building.

               A-4 THE COUPE

               stops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing 
               happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself 
               out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the 
               open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty-
               five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be 
               something wrong with his left shoulder.

               He straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into 
               his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a 
               light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He 
               shuts the car door and walks toward the building.

               A-5 ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING

               Above the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered: 
               "PACIFIC BUILDING". To the left of entrance there is a 
               drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. 
               The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP 
               WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on 
               the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the 
               building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the 
               left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand 
               closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One 
               elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark 
               lobby.

               The man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out 
               of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with 
               a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the 
               other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, 
               looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door 
               and pulls it open.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         Hello there, Mr. Neff.

               Neff walks in past him without answering.

               A-6 INT. LOBBY

               Neff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after 
               him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator.

               A-7 ELEVATOR

               Neff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard 
               with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         Working pretty late aren't you, Mr. 
                         Neff?

                                     NEFF
                              (Tight-lipped)
                         Late enough.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         You look kind of all in at that.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm fine. Let's ride.

               Night watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         How's the insurance business, Mr. 
                         Neff?

                                     NEFF
                         Okay.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         They wouldn't ever sell me any. They 
                         say I've got something loose in my 
                         heart. I say it's rheumatism.

                                     NEFF
                              (Scarcely listening)
                         Uh-huh.

               Night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the 
               elevator stops.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                              (Surly)
                         Twelve.

               The door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of 
               frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE 
               COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light 
               beyond the glass doors.

               Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, 
               across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The 
               night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, 
               elevator doors start to close.

               A-8 TWELFTH FLOOR INSURANCE OFFICE

               (Note for set-designer: Our Insurance Company occupies the 
               entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. On the 
               twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales 
               departments. These all open off a balcony which runs all the 
               way around. From the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: 
               one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing 
               cabinets, business machines, etc.)

               Neff comes through the double entrance doors from the 
               reception room. The twelfth floor is dark. Some light shines 
               up from the eleventh floor. Neff takes a few steps then holds 
               on to the balcony railing and looks down.

               A-9 THE ELEVENTH FLOOR FROM ABOVE - NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW

               Two colored women are cleaning the offices. One is dry-mopping 
               the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, 
               etc. A colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square 
               box. He shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a 
               little tune.

               A-10 NEFF

               Moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face, 
               and walks past two or three offices (CAMERA WITH HIM) towards 
               a glass door with number twenty-seven on it and three names: 
               HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens 
               the door.

               A-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - DARK

               Three desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one 
               dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records 
               underneath, telephones on all three desks. Water cooler with 
               inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. Two windows 
               facing toward front of building. Venetian blinds. No curtains. 
               Waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. The office has not 
               been cleaned.

               Neff enters, switches on desk lamp. He looks across at dicta 
               phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. He 
               leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling faint. 
               He turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps 
               and falls heavily into a swivel chair. His head goes far 
               back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. For a 
               moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open 
               slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand 
               flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens 
               his tie and shirt. This was quite an effort. He rests for a 
               second, breathing hard. With the help of his good hand he 
               edges his left elbow up on the arm-rest of the chair, supports 
               it there and then pulls his jacket wide. A heavy patch of 
               dark blood shows on his shirt. He pushes his chair along the 
               floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right 
               hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses 
               with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks 
               the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against 
               the wound inside his shirt. Next, he gets a handful of water 
               and splashes it on his face. The water runs down his chin 
               and drips. He breathes heavily, with closed eyes. He fingers 
               a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks 
               at it. There is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the 
               desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. Some 
               are blood-stained, a few are clean. He takes one, puts it 
               between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette. 
               He takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose.

               He pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel 
               chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the 
               dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. He presses the button 
               switch on the horn. The sound stops, the record revolves on 
               the cylinder. He begins to speak:

                                     NEFF
                         Office memorandum, Walter Neff to 
                         Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los 
                         Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes: 
                         I suppose you'll call this a 
                         confession when you hear it. I don't 
                         like the word confession. I just 
                         want to set you right about one thing 
                         you couldn't see, because it was 
                         smack up against your nose. You think 
                         you're such a hot potato as a claims 
                         manager, such a wolf on a phoney 
                         claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes, 
                         but let's take a look at this 
                         Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double 
                         Indemnity. You were pretty good in 
                         there for a while, all right. You 
                         said it wasn't an accident. Check. 
                         You said it wasn't suicide. Check. 
                         You said it was murder. Check and 
                         double check. You thought you had it 
                         cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, 
                         with pink ribbons around it. It was 
                         perfect, except that it wasn't, 
                         because you made a mistake, just one 
                         tiny little mistake. When it came to 
                         picking the killer, you picked the 
                         wrong guy, if you know what I mean. 
                         Want to know who killed Dietrichson? 
                         Hold tight to that cheap cigar of 
                         yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson. 
                         Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35 
                         years old, unmarried, no visible 
                         scars --
                              (He glances down at 
                              his wounded shoulder)
                         Until a little while ago, that is. 
                         Yes, I killed him. I killed him for 
                         money -- and a woman -- and I didn't 
                         get the money and I didn't get the 
                         woman. Pretty, isn't it?

               He interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk. 
               He takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it 
               two or three times, and kills it. He picks up the horn again.

                                     NEFF
                              (His voice is now 
                              quiet and contained)
                          It began last May. About the end of 
                         May, it was. I had to run out to 
                         Glendale to deliver a policy on some 
                         dairy trucks. On the way back I 
                         remembered this auto renewal on Los 
                         Feliz. So I decided to run over there. 
                         It was one of those Calif. Spanish 
                         houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 
                         15 years ago. This one must have 
                         cost somebody about 30,000 bucks -- 
                         that is, if he ever finished paying 
                         for it.

               As he goes on speaking, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               A-12 DIETRICHSON HOME - LOS FELIZ DISTRICT

               Palm trees line the street, middle-class houses, mostly in 
               Spanish style. Some kids throwing a baseball back and forth 
               across a couple of front lawns. An ice cream wagon dawdles 
               along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream 
               wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets 
               out. He carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back 
               of his head. His movements are easy and full of ginger. He 
               inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front 
               porch and rings the bell.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         It was mid-afternoon, and it's funny, 
                         I can still remember the smell of 
                         honeysuckle all along that block. I 
                         felt like a million. There was no 
                         way in all this world I could have 
                         known that murder sometimes can smell 
                         like honeysuckle...

               A-13 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - ENTRANCE DOOR

               Neff rings the bell again and waits. The door opens. A maid, 
               about forty-five, rather slatternly, opens the door.

                                     NEFF
                         Mr. Dietrichson in?

                                     MAID
                         Who wants to see him?

                                     NEFF
                         The name is Neff. Walter Neff.

                                     MAID
                         If you're selling something --

                                     NEFF
                         Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I'd like 
                         to talk to, and it's not magazine 
                         subscriptions.

               He pushes past her into the house.

               A-14 HALLWAY - DIETRICHSON HOME

               Spanish craperoo in style, as is the house throughout. A 
               wrought-iron staircase curves down from the second floor. A 
               fringed Mexican shawl hangs down over the landing. A large 
               tapestry hangs on the wall. Downstairs, the dining room to 
               one side, living room on the other side visible through a 
               wide archway. All of this, architecture, furniture, 
               decorations, etc., is genuine early Leo Carrillo period. 
               Neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door 
               open.

                                     MAID
                         Listen, Mr. Dietrichson's not in.

                                     NEFF
                         How soon do you expect him?

                                     MAID
                         He'll be home when he gets here, if 
                         that's any help to you.

               At this point a voice comes from the top of the stairs.

                                     VOICE
                         What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

               Neff looks up.

               A-15 UPPER LANDING OF STAIRCASE - (FROM BELOW)

               Phyllis Dietrichson stands looking down. She is in her early 
               thirties. She holds a large bath-towel around her very 
               appetizing torso, down to about two inches above her knees. 
               She wears no stockings, no nothing. On her feet a pair of 
               high-heeled bedroom slippers with pom-poms. On her left ankle 
               a gold anklet.

                                     MAID'S VOICE
                         It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Looking down at Neff)
                         I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?

               A-16 SHOOTING DOWN FROM UPPER LANDING

               Neff looks up, takes his hat off.

                                     NEFF
                         How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'm 
                         Walter Neff, Pacific All-Risk.

               A-17 PHYLLIS

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Pacific all-what?

               A-18 NEFF

                                     NEFF
                         Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company. 
                         It's about some renewals on the 
                         automobiles, Mrs. Dietrichson. I've 
                         been trying to contact your husband 
                         for the past two weeks. He's never 
                         at his office.

               A-19 PHYLLIS

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Is there anything I can do?

               A-20 NEFF

                                     NEFF
                         The insurance ran out on the 
                         fifteenth. I'd hate to think of your 
                         getting a smashed fender or something 
                         while you're not fully covered.

               A-21 PHYLLIS

               She glances over her towel costume.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (With a little smile)
                         Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. 
                         Neff. I've just been taking a sun 
                         bath.

               A-22 NEFF

                                     NEFF
                         No pigeons around, I hope... About 
                         those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson -- 
                         I hate to take up your time --

               A-23 PHYLLIS

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's all right. If you can wait 
                         till I put something on, I'll be 
                         right down. Nettie, show Mr. Neff 
                         into the living room.

               She turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a 
               wrapper.]

               A-24 ENTRANCE HALL

               Neff watches Phyllis out of sight. He speaks to the maid 
               while still looking up.

                                     NEFF
                         Where would the living room be?

                                     MAID
                         In there, but they keep the liquor 
                         locked up.

                                     NEFF
                         That's okay. I always carry my own 
                         keys.

               He goes through the archway. Maid goes off the other way.

               A-25 LIVING ROOM

               Neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the 
               plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks 
               around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with 
               a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet 
               photographs standing in a staggered position on top. Neff 
               glances them over: Mr. Dietrichson, age about fifty-one, a 
               big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about him; 
               Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress 
               and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from 
               the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the 
               rug. His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. He carefully 
               straightens it out with his foot. His back is to the archway 
               as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns 
               and looks through the arch.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         The living room was still stuffy 
                         from last night's cigars. The windows 
                         were closed and the sunshine coming 
                         in through the Venetian blinds showed 
                         up the dust in the air. The furniture 
                         was kind of corny and old-fashioned, 
                         but it had a comfortable look, as if 
                         people really sat in it. On the piano, 
                         in couple of fancy frames, were Mr. 
                         Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter 
                         by his first wife They had a bowl of 
                         those little red goldfish on the 
                         table behind the davenport, but, to 
                         tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't 
                         a whole lot interested in goldfish 
                         right then, nor in auto renewals, 
                         nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his 
                         daughter Lola. I was thinking about 
                         that dame upstairs, and the way she 
                         had looked at me, and I wanted to 
                         see her again, close, without that 
                         silly staircase between us.

               A-26 STAIRCASE (FROM NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW)

               Phyllis Dietrichson is coming downstairs. First we see her 
               feet, with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left 
               ankle. CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as she descends, until we 
               see all of her. She is wearing a pale blue summer dress.

                                     PHYLLIS' VOICE
                         I wasn't long, was I?

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK WITH HER INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I hope I've got my face on straight.

                                     NEFF
                         It's perfect for my money.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Crossing to the mirror 
                              over the fireplace)
                         Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is 
                         the name, isn't it?

                                     NEFF
                         With two f's, like in Philadelphia. 
                         If you know the story.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What story?

                                     NEFF
                         The Philadelphia story. What are we 
                         talking about?

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (She works with her 
                              lipstick)
                         About the insurance. My husband never 
                         tells me anything.

                                     NEFF
                         It's on your two cars, the La Salle 
                         and the Plymouth.

               He crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his 
               briefcase. She turns away from the mirror and sits in a big 
               chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly 
               visible.

                                     NEFF
                         We've been handling this insurance 
                         for three years for Mr. Dietrichson...
                              (His eyes have caught 
                              the anklet)
                         That's a honey of an anklet you're 
                         wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

               Phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress.

                                     NEFF
                         We'd hate to see the policies lapse. 
                         Of course, we give him thirty days. 
                         That's all we're allowed to give.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I guess he's been too busy down at 
                         Long Beach in the oil fields.

                                     NEFF
                         Could I catch him home some evening 
                         for a few minutes?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I suppose so. But he's never home 
                         much before eight.

                                     NEFF
                         That would be fine with me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You're not connected with the 
                         Automobile Club, are you?

                                     NEFF
                         No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. 
                         Why?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Somebody from the Automobile Club 
                         has been trying to get him. Do they 
                         have a better rate?

                                     NEFF
                         If your husband's a member.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No, he isn't.

               Phyllis rises and walks up and down, paying less and less 
               attention.

                                     NEFF
                         Well, he'd have to join the club and 
                         pay a membership fee to start with. 
                         The Automobile Club is fine. I never 
                         knock the other fellow's merchandise, 
                         Mrs. Dietrichson, but I can do just 
                         as well for you. I have a very 
                         attractive policy here. It wouldn't 
                         take me two minutes to put it in 
                         front of your husband.

               He consults the policies he is holding.

                                     NEFF
                         For instance, we're writing a new 
                         kind of fifty percent retention 
                         feature in the collision coverage.

               Phyllis stops in her walk.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You're a smart insurance man, aren't 
                         you, Mr. Neff?

                                     NEFF
                         I've had eleven years of it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Doing pretty well?

                                     NEFF
                         It's a living.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You handle just automobile insurance, 
                         or all kinds?

               She sits down again, in the same position as before.

                                     NEFF
                         All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft, 
                         public liability, group insurance, 
                         industrial stuff and so on right 
                         down the line.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Accident insurance?

                                     NEFF
                         Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson.

               His eyes fall on the anklet again.

                                     NEFF
                         I wish you'd tell me what's engraved 
                         on that anklet.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Just my name.

                                     NEFF
                         As for instance?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Phyllis.

                                     NEFF
                         Phyllis. I think I like that.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But you're not sure?

                                     NEFF
                         I'd have to drive it around the block 
                         a couple of times.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Standing up again)
                         Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by 
                         tomorrow evening about eight-thirty. 
                         He'll be in then.

                                     NEFF
                         Who?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         My husband. You were anxious to talk 
                         to him weren't you?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, only I'm getting over it a 
                         little. If you know what I mean.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         There's a speed limit in this state, 
                         Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour.

                                     NEFF
                         How fast was I going, officer?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'd say about ninety.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose you get down off your 
                         motorcycle and give me a ticket.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose I let you off with a warning 
                         this time.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose it doesn't take.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose I have to whack you over the 
                         knuckles.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose I bust out crying and put my 
                         head on your shoulder.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose you try putting it on my 
                         husband's shoulder.

                                     NEFF
                         That tears it.

               Neff takes his hat and briefcase.

                                     NEFF
                         Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then, 
                         Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's what I suggested.

               They both move toward the archway.

               A-27 HALLWAY - PHYLLIS AND NEFF GOING TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE 
               DOOR

                                     NEFF
                         Will you be here, too?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I guess so. I usually am.

                                     NEFF
                         Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Opening the door)
                          I wonder if I know what you mean.

                                     NEFF
                         I wonder if you wonder.

               He walks out.

               A-28 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (DAY)

               Shooting past Neff's parked car towards the entrance door, 
               which is just closing. Neff comes towards the car, swinging 
               his briefcase. He opens the car door and looks back with a 
               confident smile.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Over scene)
                         She liked me. I could feel that. The 
                         way you feel when the cards are...

               A-29 ENTRANCE DOOR, DIETRICHSON HOME

               In the upper panel the peep window opens and Phyllis looks 
               out after Neff.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         falling right for you, with a nice 
                         little pile of blue and yellow chips 
                         in the middle of the table. Only 
                         what I didn't know then was that I 
                         wasn't playing her. She was playing 
                         me -- with a deck of marked cards -- 
                         and the stakes weren't any blue and 
                         yellow chips. They were dynamite. I 
                         went back to the office that afternoon 
                         to see if I had any mail. It was the 
                         same afternoon you had that Sam 
                         Gorlopis on the carpet, that truck 
                         driver from Inglewood, remember, 
                         Keyes?

               A-30 NEFF

               He sits in his car, presses the starter button, looking back 
               towards the little window in the entrance door.

               A-31 ENTRANCE DOOR

               The peep window is quickly closed from inside.

               A-32 STREET

               Neff makes a U-turn and drives back down the block.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-33 LONG SHOT - INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - (DAY) - 
               CAMERA HIGH

               Activity on the eleventh floor below. Typewriters working, 
               adding machines, filing clerks, secretaries, and so forth. 
               Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase, enters 
               from the vestibule. He walks towards his office. He passes a 
               few salesmen, etc. There is an exchange of greetings. Just 
               as he reaches his office a secretary comes out. She stops.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Oh, Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see 
                         you. He's been yelling for you all 
                         afternoon.

                                     NEFF
                         Is he sore, or just frothing at the 
                         mouth a little? Here, park these for 
                         me, sweetheart.

               He hands her his hat and briefcase and continues right on, 
               CAMERA WITH HIM, to a door lettered:

                              BARTON KEYES - CLAIMS MANAGER

               Keyes' voice is heard inside, plenty loud. Neff grins as he 
               opens the door and goes in.

               A-34 KEYES: OFFICE - (DAY)

               A minor executive office, not too tidy: large desk across 
               one corner, good carpet, several chairs, filing cabinet 
               against one wall, a dictaphone on the corner of the desk.

               Keyes is sitting behind the desk with his coat off but his 
               hat on. A cigar is clamped in his mouth, ashes falling like 
               snow down his vest, a gold chair and elk's tooth across it. 
               On the other side of the desk sits Sam Gorlopis. He is a 
               big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall -- a dirty 
               work shirt and corduroy pants, rough, untidy hair, broad 
               face, small piggish eyes. He holds a sweat-soaked hat on his 
               knee with a hairy hand. He is chewing gum rapidly. As Neff 
               opens the door, Keyes is giving it to Gorlopis.

                                     KEYES
                         Wise up, Gorlopis. You're not kidding 
                         anybody with that line of bull. You're 
                         in a jam and you know it.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Sez you. All I want is my money.

                                     KEYES
                         Sez you. All you're gonna get is the 
                         cops.

               He sees Neff standing inside the door.

                                     KEYES
                         Come in, Walter. This is Sam Gorlopis 
                         from Inglewood.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis. Wrote a 
                         policy on his truck. How are you, 
                         Mr. Gorlopis?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         I ain't so good. My truck burned 
                         down.

               He looks cautiously sideways at Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah, he just planted his big foot 
                         on the starter and the whole thing 
                         blazed up in his face.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Yes, sir.

                                     KEYES
                         And didn't even singe his eyebrows.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         No sir. Look, mister. I got twenty-
                         six hundred bucks tied up in that 
                         truck. I'm insured with this company 
                         and I want my money.

                                     KEYES
                         You got a wife, Gorlopis?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Sure I got a wife.

                                     KEYES
                         You got kids?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Two kids.

                                     KEYES
                         What you got for dinner tonight?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         We got meat loaf.

                                     KEYES
                         How do you make your meat loaf, 
                         Gorlopis?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Veal and pork and bread and garlic. 
                         Greek style.

                                     KEYES
                         How much garlic?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Lotsa garlic, Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Okay, Gorlopis. Now listen here. 
                         Let's say you just came up here to 
                         tell me how to make meat loaf. That's 
                         all, understand? Because if you came 
                         up here to claim on that truck, I'd 
                         have to turn you over to the law, 
                         Gorlopis, and they'd put you in jail. 
                         No wife. No kids --

                                     GORLOPIS
                         What for?

                                     KEYES
                              (Yelling)
                         And no meat loaf, Gorlopis!

                                     GORLOPIS
                         I didn't do nothin'.

                                     KEYES
                         No? Look, Gorlopis. Every month 
                         hundreds of claims come to this desk. 
                         Some of them are phonies, and I know 
                         which ones. How do I know, Gorlopis?
                              (He speaks as if to a 
                              child)
                         Because my little man tells me.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         What little man?

                                     KEYES
                         The little man in here.

               He pounds the pit of his stomach.

                                     KEYES
                         Every time one of those phonies comes 
                         along he ties knots in my stomach. 
                         And yours was one of them, Gorlopis. 
                         That's how I knew your claim was 
                         crooked. So what did I do? I sent a 
                         tow car out to your garage this 
                         afternoon and they jacked up that 
                         burned-out truck of yours. And what 
                         did they find, Gorlopis? They found 
                         what was left of a pile of shavings.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         What shavings?

                                     KEYES
                         The ones you soaked with kerosene 
                         and dropped a match on.

               Gorlopis cringes under the impact.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Look, Mr. Keyes, I'm just a poor 
                         guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

                                     KEYES
                         That's one way of putting it.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         I ain't feelin' so good, Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Sign this and you'll feel fine.

               He puts a blank form in front of him and points.

                                     KEYES
                         Right there. It's a waiver on your 
                         claim.

               Gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously.

                                     KEYES
                         Now you're an honest man again.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         But I ain't got no more truck.

                                     KEYES
                         Goodbye, Gorlopis.

                                     GORLOPIS
                              (Still bewildered)
                         Goodbye, Mr. Keyes.

               He stands up and goes slowly to the door and turns there.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Twenty-six hundred bucks. That's a 
                         lot of dough where I live.

                                     KEYES
                         What's the matter, Gorlopis? Don't 
                         you know how to open the door? Just 
                         put your hand on the knob, turn it 
                         to the right, pull it toward you --

                                     GORLOPIS
                              (Doing just as Keyes 
                              says)
                         Like this, Mr. Keyes?

                                     KEYES
                         That's the boy. Now the same thing 
                         from the outside.

                                     GORLOPIS
                              (Stupefied)
                         Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

               He goes out, closing the door after him. Keyes takes his 
               cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame 
               of a lighted match. He turns to Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         What kind of an outfit is this anyway? 
                         Are we an insurance company, or a 
                         bunch of dimwitted amateurs, writing 
                         a policy on a mugg like that?

                                     NEFF
                         Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate 
                         this beef. I clipped a note to that 
                         Gorlopis application to have him 
                         thoroughly investigated before we 
                         accepted the risk.

                                     KEYES
                         I know you did, Walter. I'm not 
                         beefing at you. It's the company. 
                         The way they do things. The way they 
                         don't do things. The way they'll 
                         write anything just to get it down 
                         on the sales sheet. And I'm the guy 
                         that has to sit here up to my neck 
                         in phony claims so they won't throw 
                         more money out of the window than 
                         they take in at the door.

                                     NEFF
                              (Grinning)
                         Okay, turn the record over and let's 
                         hear the other side.

                                     KEYES
                         I get darn sick of picking up after 
                         a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb 
                         enough to sell life insurance to a 
                         guy that sleeps in the same bed with 
                         four rattlesnakes. I've had twenty-
                         six years of that, Walter, and I --

                                     NEFF
                         And you loved every minute of it, 
                         Keyes. You love it, only you worry 
                         about it too much, you and your little 
                         man. You're so darn conscientious 
                         you're driving yourself crazy. You 
                         wouldn't even say today is Tuesday 
                         without you looked at the calendar, 
                         and then you would check if it was 
                         this year's or last year's calendar, 
                         and then you would find out what 
                         company printed the calendar, then 
                         find out if their calendar checks 
                         with the World Almanac's calendar.

                                     KEYES
                         That's enough from you, Walter. Get 
                         out of here before I throw my desk 
                         at you.

                                     NEFF
                         I love you, too.

               He walks out, still grinning.

               A-35 EXT. OFFICES - TWELFTH FLOOR

               Neff comes out of Keys' office and walks back along the 
               balcony. Activity of secretaries going in and out of doors, 
               etc. Neff enters his own office.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Over scene)
                         I really did, too, you old crab, 
                         always yelling your fat head off, 
                         always sore at everyone. But behind 
                         the cigar ashes on your vest I kind 
                         of knew you had a heart as big as a 
                         house... Back in my office there was 
                         a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson 
                         about the renewals. She didn't want 
                         me to come tomorrow evening. She 
                         wanted me to come Thursday afternoon 
                         at three-thirty instead. I had a lot 
                         of stuff lined up for that Thursday 
                         afternoon, including a trip down to 
                         Santa Monica to see a couple of live 
                         prospects about some group insurance. 
                         But I kept thinking about Phyllis 
                         Dietrichson and the way that anklet 
                         of hers cut into her leg.

               A-36 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE

               Anderson, a salesman, sits at one of the desks, filling out 
               a report. Neff enters, goes to his own desk. He looks down 
               at some mail. On top there is a typewritten note. He reads 
               it, sits down and leafs through his desk calendar.

               A-37 INSERT - CLOSEUP - CALENDAR PAGE

               Showing date: THURSDAY 23 May and five or six appointments 
               penciled in tightly on the page.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-38 DIETRICHSON HOME - ENTRANCE HALL - (DAY)

               THE CAMERA PANS with Phyllis Dietrichson's feet and ankles 
               as she comes down the stairs, her high heels clicking on the 
               tiles. The anklet glistens on her leg as she moves. THE CAMERA 
               PANS ON. Phyllis has reached the entrance hall, and as she 
               walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible. 
               She wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips. 
               She opens the door. Outside is Neff, wearing a sport coat, 
               flannel slacks. He takes his hat off.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Hello, Mr. Neff.

               He stands there with a little smile.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Aren't you coming in?

                                     NEFF
                         I'm considering it.

               He comes in.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I hope you didn't mind my changing 
                         the appointment. Last night wasn't 
                         so convenient.

                                     NEFF
                         That's okay. I was working on my 
                         stamp collection.

               She leads him toward living room.

               A-39 DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM

               Phyllis and Neff come through archway. She heads toward a 
               low tea table which stands in front of the davenport, with 
               tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, a pot of tea, etc.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I was just fixing some iced tea. 
                         Would you like a glass?

                                     NEFF
                         Unless you have a bottle of beer 
                         that's not working.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         There might be some. I never know 
                         what's in the ice box.
                              (Calls)
                         Nettie!... 

               She pours herself a glass of tea.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I 
                         talked to my husband about it.

                                     NEFF
                         You did?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. He'll renew with you he told 
                         me. In fact, I thought he'd be here 
                         this afternoon.

                                     NEFF
                         But he's not?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No.

                                     NEFF
                         That's terrible.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Calls again, 
                              impatiently)
                         Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot, 
                         it's the maid's day off.

                                     NEFF
                         Don't bother, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'd 
                         like some iced tea very much.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Lemon? Sugar?

                                     NEFF
                         Fix it your way.

               She fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around. He 
               slowly sits down.

                                     NEFF
                         Seeing it's the maid's day off maybe 
                         there's something I can do for you.

               She hands him the tea.

                                     NEFF
                         Like running the vacuum cleaner.

                         I used to peddle vacuum cleaners. 
                         Not much money but you learn a lot 
                         about life.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I didn't think you'd learned it from 
                         a correspondence course.

                         Where did you pick up this tea 
                         drinking? You're not English, are 
                         you?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. Californian. Born right here in 
                         Los Angeles.

                         They say native Californians all 
                         come from Iowa.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I wanted to ask you something, Mr. 
                         Neff.

                                     NEFF
                         Make it Walter.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Right.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Tell me, Walter, on this insurance -- 
                         how much commission do you make?

                                     NEFF
                         Twenty percent. Why?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I thought maybe I could throw a little 
                         more business your way.

                                     NEFF
                         I can always use it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I was thinking about my husband. I 
                         worry a lot about him, down in those 
                         oil fields. It's very dangerous.

                                     NEFF
                         Not for an executive, is it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He doesn't just sit behind a desk. 
                         He's right down there with the 
                         drilling crews. It's got me worried 
                         sick.

                                     NEFF
                         You mean a crown block might fall on 
                         him some rainy night?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Please don't talk like that.

                                     NEFF
                         But that's the idea.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         The other day a casing line snapped 
                         and caught the foreman. He's in the 
                         hospital with a broken back.

                                     NEFF
                         Bad.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's got me jittery just thinking 
                         about it. Suppose something like 
                         that happened to my husband?

                                     NEFF
                         It could.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't you think he ought to have 
                         accident insurance?

                                     NEFF
                         Uh huh.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What kind of insurance could he have?

                                     NEFF
                         Enough to cover doctors' and hospital 
                         bills. Say a hundred and twenty-five 
                         a week cash benefit. And he'd rate 
                         around fifty thousand capital sum.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Capital sum? What's that?

                                     NEFF
                         That's if he got killed. Maybe I 
                         shouldn't have said that.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I suppose you have to think of 
                         everything in your business.

                                     NEFF
                         Mr. Dietrichson would understand. 
                         I'm sure I could sell him on the 
                         idea of some accident protection. 
                         Why don't I talk to him about it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You could try. But he's pretty tough 
                         going.

                                     NEFF
                         They're all tough at first.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't 
                         want to listen to anything except 
                         maybe a baseball game on the radio. 
                         Sometimes we sit all evening without 
                         saying a word to each other.

                                     NEFF
                         Sounds pretty dull.

               Phyllis shrugs.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         So I just sit and knit.

                                     NEFF
                         Is that what you married him for?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold 
                         up the wool.

                                     NEFF
                         Anytime his thumbs get tired --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I want to ask you something, Mr. 
                         Neff. Could I get an accident policy 
                         for him -- without bothering him at 
                         all?

                                     NEFF
                         How's that again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That would make it easier for you, 
                         too. You wouldn't even have to talk 
                         to him. I have a little allowance of 
                         my own. I could pay for it and he 
                         needn't know anything about it.

                                     NEFF
                         Wait a minute. Why shouldn't he know?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Because I know he doesn't want 
                         accident insurance. He's superstitious 
                         about it.

                                     NEFF
                         A lot of people are. Funny, isn't 
                         it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         If there was a way to get it like 
                         that, all the worry would be over. 
                         You see what I mean, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. I've got good eyesight. You 
                         want him to have the policy without 
                         him knowing it. And that means without 
                         the insurance company knowing that 
                         he doesn't know. That's the set-up, 
                         isn't it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Is there anything wrong with it?

                                     NEFF
                         I think it's lovely. And then, some 
                         dark wet night, if that crown block 
                         fell on him --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What crown block?

                                     NEFF
                         Only sometimes they have to have a 
                         little help. They can't quite make 
                         it on their own.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     NEFF
                         Of course, it doesn't have to be a 
                         crown block. It can be a car backing 
                         over him, or he can fall out of an 
                         upstairs window. Any little thing 
                         like that, as long as it's a morgue 
                         job.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Are you crazy?

                                     NEFF
                         Not that crazy. Goodbye, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson.

               He picks up his hat.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's the matter?

                                     NEFF
                         Look, baby, you can't get away with 
                         it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Get away with what?

                                     NEFF
                         You want to knock him off, don't 
                         you, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's a horrible thing to say!

                                     NEFF
                         Who'd you think I was, anyway? A guy 
                         that walks into a good-looking dame's 
                         front parlor and says "Good afternoon, 
                         I sell accident insurance on husbands. 
                         You got one that's been around too 
                         long? Somebody you'd like to turn 
                         into a little hard cash? Just give 
                         me a smile and I'll help you collect." 
                         Boy, what a dope I must look to you!

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I think you're rotten.

                                     NEFF
                         I think you're swell. So long as I'm 
                         not your husband.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Get out of here.

                                     NEFF
                         You bet I will. You bet I'll get out 
                         of here, baby. But quick.

               He goes out. She looks after him.

               A-40 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (DAY)

               Neff bangs the front door shut, walks quickly to his car and 
               drives away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Over scene)
                         So I let her have it, straight between 
                         the eyes. She didn't fool me for a 
                         minute, not this time. I knew I had 
                         hold of a redhot poker and the time 
                         to drop it was before it burned my 
                         hand off. I stopped at a drive-in 
                         for a bottle of beer, the one I had 
                         wanted all along, only I wanted it 
                         worse now, to get rid of the sour 
                         taste of her iced tea, and everything 
                         that went with it. I didn't want to 
                         go back to the office, so I dropped 
                         by a bowling alley at Third and 
                         Western and rolled a few lines to 
                         get my mind thinking about something 
                         else for a while.

               A-41 DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - (DAY)

               Shooting past Neff sitting behind the wheel of his car The 
               car hop hangs a tray on the door and serves him a bottle of 
               beer.

               A-42 INT. BOWLING ALLEY

               Neff bowling. He rolls the ball with an effort at 
               concentration, but his mind is not really on the game.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-43 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - (DUSK)

               It is late afternoon. The apartment house is called the LOS 
               OLIVOS APARTMENTS. It is a six-story building in the Normandie-
               Wilshire district, with a basement garage. THE CAMERA PANS 
               UP the front of the building to the top floor windows, as a 
               little rain starts to fall.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                         I didn't feel like eating dinner 
                         when I left, and I didn't feel like 
                         a show, so I drove home, put the car 
                         away and went up to my apartment.

               A-44 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - (DUSK)

               It is a double apartment of conventional design, with kitchen, 
               dinette, and bathroom, squarecut overstuffed borax furniture. 
               Gas logs are lit in the imitation fireplace. Neff stands by 
               the window with his coat off and his tie loose. Raindrops 
               strike against the glass. He turns away impatiently, paces 
               up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls 
               one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws 
               the club on the couch, paces again.

                              (Continuing)
                         It had begun to rain outside and I 
                         watched it get dark and didn't even 
                         turn on the light. That didn't help 
                         me either. I was all twisted up 
                         inside, and I was still holding on 
                         to that red-hot poker. And right 
                         then it came over me that I hadn't 
                         walked out on anything at all, that 
                         the hook was too strong, that this 
                         wasn't the end between her and me. 
                         It was only the beginning.

               The doorbell rings.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Continuing)
                         So at eight o'clock the bell would 
                         ring and I would know who it was 
                         without even having to think, as if 
                         it was the most natural thing in the 
                         world.

               Neff goes to the door and opens it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Hello.

               Neff just looks at her.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You forgot your hat this afternoon.

               She has nothing in her hands but her bag.

                                     NEFF
                         Did I?

               He looks down at her hands.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't you want me to bring it in?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. Put it on the chair.

               She comes in. He closes the door.

                                     NEFF
                         How did you know where I live?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's in the phone book.

               Neff switches on the standing lamp.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's raining.

                                     NEFF
                         So it is. Peel off your coat and sit 
                         down.

               She starts to take off her coat.

                                     NEFF
                         Your husband out?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Long Beach. They're spudding in a 
                         new well. He phoned he'd be late. 
                         About nine-thirty.

               He takes her coat and lays it across the back of a chair.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's about time you said you're glad 
                         to see me.

                                     NEFF
                         I knew you wouldn't leave it like 
                         that.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Like what?

                                     NEFF
                         Like it was this afternoon.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I must have said something that gave 
                         you a terribly wrong impression. You 
                         must surely see that. You must never 
                         think anything like that about me, 
                         Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Okay.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's not okay. Not if you don't 
                         believe me.

                                     NEFF
                         What do you want me to do?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I want you to be nice to me. Like 
                         the first time you came to the house.

                                     NEFF
                         It can't be like the first time. 
                         Something has happened.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I know it has. It's happened to us.

                                     NEFF
                         That's what I mean.

               Phyllis has moved over to the window. She stares out through 
               the wet window-pane.

                                     NEFF
                         What's the matter now?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I feel as if he was watching me. Not 
                         that he cares about me. Not any more. 
                         But he keeps me on a leash. So tight 
                         I can't breathe. I'm scared.

                                     NEFF
                         What of? He's in Long Beach, isn't 
                         he?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I oughtn't to have come.

                                     NEFF
                         Maybe you oughtn't.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You want me to go?

                                     NEFF
                         If you want to.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Right now?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. Right now.

               By this time, he has hold of her wrist. He draws her to him 
               slowly and kisses her. Her arms tighten around him. After a 
               moment he pulls his head back, still holding her close.

                                     NEFF
                         How were you going to do it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Do what?

                                     NEFF
                         Kill him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, for the last time --

               She tries to jerk away but he holds her and kisses her again.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm crazy about you, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm crazy about you, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         That perfume on your hair. What's 
                         the name of it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Something French. I bought it down 
                         at Ensenada.

                                     NEFF
                         We ought to have some of that pink 
                         wine to go with it. The kind that 
                         bubbles. But all I have is bourbon.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Bourbon is fine, Walter.

               He lets her go and moves toward the dinette.

               A-45 THE DINETTE AND KITCHEN

               It contains a small table and some chairs. A low glass-and-
               china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, 
               leaving a space like a doorway. The kitchen is the usual 
               apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice-box, sink, etc. It 
               is quite small.

               Neff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after him.

                                     NEFF
                         Soda?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Plain water, please.

                                     NEFF
                         Get a couple of glasses, will you.

               He points at the china closet. He has taken a tray of ice 
               cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot-
               water faucet.

                                     NEFF
                         You know, about six months ago a guy 
                         slipped on the soap in his bathtub 
                         and knocked himself cold and drowned. 
                         Only he had accident insurance. So 
                         they had an autopsy and she didn't 
                         get away with it.

               Phyllis has the glasses now. She hands them to him. He dumps 
               some ice cubes into the glasses.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Who didn't?

                                     NEFF
                         His wife.

               He reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet.

                                     NEFF
                         And there was another case where a 
                         guy was found shot and his wife said 
                         he was cleaning a gun and his stomach 
                         got in the way. All she collected 
                         was a three-to-ten stretch in 
                         Tehachapi.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Perhaps it was worth it to her.

               Neff hands her a glass.

                                     NEFF
                         See if you can carry this as far as 
                         the living room.

               They move back toward the living room.

               A-46 LIVING ROOM

               Phyllis and Neff go toward the davenport. She is sipping her 
               drink and looking around.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's nice here, Walter. Who takes 
                         care of it for you?

                                     NEFF
                         A colored woman comes in twice a 
                         week.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You get your own breakfast?

                                     NEFF
                         Once in a while I squeeze a 
                         grapefruit. The rest I get at the 
                         corner drugstore.

               They sit on the davenport, fairly close together.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It sounds wonderful. Just strangers 
                         beside you. You don't know them. You 
                         don't hate them. You don't have to 
                         sit across the table and smile at 
                         him and that daughter of his every 
                         morning of your life.

                                     NEFF
                         What daughter? Oh, that little girl 
                         on the piano.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. Lola. She lives with us. He 
                         thinks a lot more of her than he 
                         does of me.

                                     NEFF
                         Ever think of a divorce?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He wouldn't give me a divorce.

                                     NEFF
                         I suppose because it would cost him 
                         money.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He hasn't got any money. Not since 
                         he went into the oil business.

                                     NEFF
                         But he had when you married him?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. 
                         Why not? But that wasn't the only 
                         reason. I was his wife's nurse. She 
                         was sick for a long time. When she 
                         died, he was all broken up. I pitied 
                         him so.

                                     NEFF
                         And now you hate him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me. 
                         Every-time I buy a dress or a pair 
                         of shoes he yells his head off. He 
                         won't let me go anywhere. He keeps 
                         me shut up. He's always been mean to 
                         me. Even his life insurance all goes 
                         to that daughter of his. That Lola.

                                     NEFF
                         Nothing for you at all, huh?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. And nothing is just what I'm 
                         worth to him.

                                     NEFF
                         So you lie awake in the dark and 
                         listen to him snore and get ideas.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, I don't want to kill him. I 
                         never did. Not even when he gets 
                         drunk and slaps my face.

                                     NEFF
                         Only sometimes you wish he was dead.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Perhaps I do.

                                     NEFF
                         And you wish it was an accident, and 
                         you had that policy. For fifty 
                         thousand dollars. Is that it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Perhaps that too.

               She takes a long drink.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         The other night we drove home from a 
                         party. He was drunk again. When we 
                         got into the garage he just sat there 
                         with his head on the steering wheel 
                         and the motor still running. And I 
                         thought what it would be like if I 
                         didn't switch it off, just closed 
                         the garage door and left him there.

                                     NEFF
                         I'll tell you what it would be like, 
                         if you had that accident policy, and 
                         tried to pull a monoxide job. We 
                         have a guy in our office named Keyes. 
                         For him a set-up like that would be 
                         just like a slice of rare roast beef. 
                         In three minutes he'd know it wasn't 
                         an accident. In ten minutes you'd be 
                         sitting under the hot lights. In 
                         half an hour you'd be signing your 
                         name to a confession.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not 
                         going to do it.

                                     NEFF
                         Not if there's an insurance company 
                         in the picture, baby. So long as 
                         you're honest they'll pay you with a 
                         smile, but you just try to pull 
                         something like that and you'll find 
                         out. They know more tricks than a 
                         carload of monkeys. And if there's a 
                         death mixed up in it, you haven't 
                         got a prayer. They'll hang you as 
                         sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar, 
                         baby.

               She begins to cry. He puts his arms around her and kisses 
               her.

                                     NEFF
                         Just stop thinking about it, will 
                         you.

               He holds her tight. Their heads touch, side by side, THE 
               CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO RECEDE as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-47 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               Neff sits in the swivel chair, talking into the dictaphone. 
               He has hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more 
               comfortably. As he talks, a little cough shakes him now and 
               then.

                                     NEFF
                         So we just sat there, and she kept 
                         on crying softly, like the rain on 
                         the window, and we didn't say 
                         anything. Maybe she had stopped 
                         thinking about it, but I hadn't. I 
                         couldn't. Because it all tied up 
                         with something I had been thinking 
                         about for years, since long before I 
                         ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson. 
                         Because, in this business you can't 
                         sleep for trying to figure out the 
                         tricks they could pull on you. You're 
                         like the guy behind the roulette 
                         wheel, watching the customers to 
                         make sure they don't crook the house. 
                         And then one night, you get to 
                         thinking how you could crook the 
                         house yourself. And do it smart. 
                         Because you've got that wheel right 
                         under your hands. And you know every 
                         notch in it by heart. And you figure 
                         all you need is a plant out in front, 
                         a shill to put down the bet. And 
                         suddenly the doorbell rings and the 
                         whole set-up is right there in the 
                         room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm 
                         not trying to whitewash myself. I 
                         fought it, only maybe I didn't fight 
                         it hard enough. The stakes were fifty 
                         thousand dollars, but they were the 
                         life of a man, too, a man who'd never 
                         done me any dirt. Except he was 
                         married to a woman he didn't care 
                         anything about, and I did...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-48 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM

               CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY towards the davenport again. Neff sits 
               in one corner with his feet on the low table. He is smoking 
               his cigarette and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis has been 
               sitting fairly close to him. She gets up slowly and crosses 
               to her rain coat, lying over a chair.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I've got to go now, Walter.

               Neff does not answer. He keeps on staring at the ceiling. 
               She starts to put the rain coat on.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Will you call me, Walter?

               Neff still does not answer.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter!

               He looks at her slowly, almost absently.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I hate him. I loathe going back to 
                         him. You believe me, don't you, 
                         Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure I believe you.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I can't stand it anymore. What if 
                         they did hang me?

                                     NEFF
                         You're not going to hang, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's better than going on this way.

                                     NEFF
                         -- you're not going to hang, baby. 
                         Not ever. Because you're going to do 
                         it the smart way. Because I'm going 
                         to help you.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You!

                                     NEFF
                         Me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Do you know what you're saying?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure I know what I'm saying.

               He gets up and grips her arm.

                                     NEFF
                         We're going to do it together. We're 
                         going to do it right. And I'm the 
                         guy that knows how.

               There is fierce determination in his voice. His fingers dig 
               into her arm.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, you're hurting me.

                                     NEFF
                         There isn't going to be any slip up. 
                         Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak. It's 
                         got to be perfect.

               He kisses her.

                                     NEFF
                         You go now.

               He leads her towards the door.

                                     NEFF
                         Call me tomorrow. But not from your 
                         house. From a booth. And watch your 
                         step. Every single minute. It's got 
                         to be perfect, understand. Straight 
                         down the line.

               They have now reached the door. Neff opens it. Phyllis stands 
               in the doorway, her lips white.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Straight down the line.

               She goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor. Slowly 
               he closes the door and goes back into the room. He moves 
               across the window and opens it wide. He stands there, looking 
               down into the dark street. From below comes the sound of a 
               car starting and driving off. The rain drifts in against his 
               face. He just stands there motionless. His mind is going a 
               hundred miles a minute.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               B-1 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the 
               desk next to him stands a used record. The cylinder on the 
               dictaphone is not turning. He is smoking a cigarette. He 
               kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record 
               which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk 
               beside the other used record. He reaches down painfully to 
               take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone, 
               looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been 
               used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets 
               the needle. He lifts the horn and resumes his dictation.

                         The first thing we had to do was fix 
                         him up with that accident policy. I 
                         knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted 
                         was his signature on an application. 
                         So I had to make him sign without 
                         his knowing what he was signing. And 
                         I wanted a witness other than Phyllis 
                         to hear me give him a sales talk. I 
                         was trying to think with your brains, 
                         Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready 
                         for all the questions you were going 
                         to spring as soon as Dietrichson was 
                         dead.

               Neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by 
               running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand. He drops 
               the stub on the floor and resumes.

                                     NEFF
                         A couple of nights later I went to 
                         the house. Everything looked fine, 
                         except I didn't like the witness 
                         Phyllis had brought in. It was 
                         Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it 
                         made me feel a little queer in the 
                         belly to have her right there in the 
                         room, playing Chinese checkers, as 
                         if nothing was going to happen.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               B-2 A BOARD OF CHINESE CHECKERS CAMERA WITHDRAWS AND 
               GRADUALLY REVEALS THE DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and 
               Lola. Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. His coat and 
               tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is 
               lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He is smoking a cigar 
               with the band on it. He has a drink in front of him and 
               several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his 
               briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds 
               his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. 
               He is going full swing.

                                     NEFF
                         I suppose you realize, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson, that, not being an 
                         employee, you are not covered by the 
                         State Compensation Insurance Act. 
                         The only way you can protect yourself 
                         is by having a personal policy of 
                         your own.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         I know all about that. The next thing 
                         you'll tell me I need earthquake 
                         insurance and lightning insurance 
                         and hail insurance.

               Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the 
               dialogue. Lola listens without much interest.

                              (To Dietrichson)
                         If we bought all the insurance they 
                         can think up, we'd stay broke paying 
                         for it, wouldn't we, honey?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         What keeps us broke is you going out 
                         and buying five hats at a crack. Who 
                         needs a hat in California?

                                     NEFF
                         I always say insurance is a lot like 
                         a hot water bottle. It looks kind of 
                         useless and silly hanging on the 
                         hook, but when you get that stomach 
                         ache in the middle of the night, it 
                         comes in mighty handy.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Now you want to sell me a hot water 
                         bottle.

                                     NEFF
                         Dollar for dollar, accident insurance 
                         is the cheapest coverage you can 
                         buy, Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I 
                         had a tough day.

                                     NEFF
                         Just as you say, Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Suppose we just settle that automobile 
                         insurance tonight.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. All we need on that is for you 
                         to sign an application for renewal.

               Phyllis throws a quick glance at Neff. As she looks back she 
               sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch.

                                     LOLA
                         Phyllis, do you mind if we don't 
                         finish this game? It bores me stiff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Got some thing better to do?

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, I have.

               She gets up.

                                     LOLA
                              (To Dietrichson)
                         Father, is it all right if I run 
                         along now?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Run along where? Who with?

                                     LOLA
                         Just Anne. We're going roller skating.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Anne who?

                                     LOLA
                         Anne Matthews.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's not that Nino Zachetti again?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         It better not be that Zachetti guy. 
                         If I ever catch you with that ---

                                     LOLA
                         It's Anne Matthews, I told you. I 
                         also told you we're going roller 
                         skating. I'm meeting her at the corner 
                         of Vermont and Franklin -- the north-
                         west corner, in case you're 
                         interested. And I'm late already. I 
                         hope that is all clear. Good night, 
                         Father. Good night, Phyllis.

               She starts to go.

                                     NEFF
                         Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

                                     LOLA
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Good night, Mr. --

                                     NEFF
                         Neff.

                                     LOLA
                         Good night, Mr. Neff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Now you're not going to take my car 
                         again.

                                     LOLA
                         No thanks. I'd rather be dead.

               She goes out through the archway.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         A great little fighter for her weight.

               Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink.

               Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase. He puts 
               the briefcase on Mr. Dietrichson's lap and lays the forms on 
               top. Phyllis is watching closely.

                                     NEFF
                         This is where you sign, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Sign what?

                                     NEFF
                         The applications for your auto 
                         renewals. So you'll be protected 
                         until the new policies are issued.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         When will that be?

                                     NEFF
                         In about a week.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Just so I'm covered when I drive up 
                         North.

               Neff takes out his fountain pen.

                                     NEFF
                         San Francisco, Mr. Dietrichson?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Palo Alto.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff. And 
                         he still goes to his class reunion 
                         every year.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         What's wrong with that? Can't I have 
                         a little fun even once a year?

                                     NEFF
                         Great football school, Stanford. Did 
                         you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Left guard. Almost made the varsity, 
                         too.

               Neff has unscrewed his fountain pen. He hands it to Mr. 
               Dietrichson. Dietrichson puts on his glasses.

                                     NEFF
                         On that bottom line, Mr. Dietrichson.

               Dietrichson signs. Neff's and Phyllis' eyes meet for a split 
               second.

                                     NEFF
                         Both copies, please.

               He withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the 
               signature line on the supposed duplicate.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Sign twice, huh?

                                     NEFF
                         One is the agent's copy. I need it 
                         for my files.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                              (In a mutter)
                         Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

               Dietrichson grunts and signs again. Again Neff and Phyllis 
               exchange a quick glance.

                                     NEFF
                         No hurry about the check, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson. I can pick it up at 
                         your office some morning.

               Casually Neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications 
               off Dietrichson's lap.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         How much you taking me for?

                                     NEFF
                         One forty-seven fifty, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson.

               Dietrichson stands up. He is about Neff's height but a little 
               heavier.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I guess that's enough insurance for 
                         one evening, Mr. Neff.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Plenty.

               Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass. He 
               tries the siphon but it is empty. He gathers up his coat and 
               tie and picks up his glass.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Good night, Mr. Neff.

               Neff is zipping up his briefcase.

                                     NEFF
                         Good night, Mr. Dietrichson. Good 
                         night, Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Bring me some soda when you come up, 
                         Phyllis.

               Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (To Neff)
                         I think you left your hat in the 
                         hall.

               Phyllis leads the way and Neff goes after her, his briefcase 
               under his arm.

               B-3 HALLWAY DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)

               Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff 
               behind her. She leads him towards the door. On the way he 
               picks up his hat. In the BACKGROUND Dietrichson begins to 
               ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and 
               Neff move close to the door. They speak in very low voices.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         All right, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Fine.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He signed it, didn't he?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure he signed it. You saw him.

               Phyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, 
               where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off 
               the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm.

                                     NEFF
                              (Looking up)
                         Watch it, will you.

               Phyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm. Both look up as 
               Dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight.

                                     NEFF
                         Listen. That trip to Palo Alto When 
                         does he go?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         End of the month.

                                     NEFF
                         He drives, huh?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He always drives.

                                     NEFF
                         Not this time. You're going to make 
                         him take the train.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Why?

                                     NEFF
                         Because it's all worked out for a 
                         train.

               For a second they stand listening and looking up as if they 
               had heard a sound.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's all right. Go on, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Look, baby. There's a clause in every 
                         accident policy, a little something 
                         called double indemnity. The insurance 
                         companies put it in as a sort of 
                         come-on for the customers. It means 
                         they pay double on certain accidents. 
                         The kind that almost never happen. 
                         Like for instance if a guy got killed 
                         on a train, they'd pay a hundred 
                         thousand instead of fifty.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I see.
                              (Her eyes widen with 
                              excitement)

                                     NEFF
                         We're hitting it for the limit, baby. 
                         That's why it's got to be a train.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's going to be a train, Walter. 
                         Just the way you say. Straight down 
                         the line.

               They look at each other. The look is like a long kiss. Neff 
               goes out. Slowly Phyllis closes the door and leans her head 
               against it as she looks up the empty stairway.

               B-4 EXT. DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)

               Neff, briefcase under his arm, comes down the steps to the 
               street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens 
               the door and stops, looking in.

               Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the 
               steering wheel, is Lola. She wears a coat but no hat.

                                     LOLA
                         Hello, Mr. Neff. It's me.

               Lola gives him a sly smile. Neff is a little annoyed.

                                     NEFF
                         Something the matter?

                                     LOLA
                         I've been waiting for you.

                                     NEFF
                         For me? What for?

                                     LOLA
                         I thought you could let me ride with 
                         you, if you're going my way.

               Neff doesn't like the idea very much.

                                     NEFF
                         Which way would that be?

                                     LOLA
                         Down the hill. Down Vermont.

                                     NEFF
                              (Remembering)
                         Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin. North-
                         west corner, wasn't it? Be glad to, 
                         Miss Dietrichson.

               Neff gets into the car.

               B-5 INT. COUPE - (NIGHT) - (TRANSPARENCY)

               Neff puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's 
               seat. He closes the door and starts the car. They drift down 
               the hill.

                                     NEFF
                         Roller skating, eh? You like roller 
                         skating?

                                     LOLA
                         I can take it or leave it.

               Neff looks at her curiously. Lola meets his glance.

                                     NEFF
                         Only tonight you're leaving it?

               This is an embarrassing moment for Lola.

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, I am. You see, Mr. Neff, I'm 
                         having a very tough time at home. My 
                         father doesn't understand me and 
                         Phyllis hates me.

                                     NEFF
                         That does sound tough, all right.

                                     LOLA
                         That's why I have to lie sometimes.

                                     NEFF
                         You mean it's not Vermont and 
                         Franklin.

                                     LOLA
                         It's Vermont and Franklin all right. 
                         Only it's not Anne Matthews. It's 
                         Nino Zachetti. You won't tell on me, 
                         will you?

                                     NEFF
                         I'd have to think it over.

                                     LOLA
                         Nino's not what my father says at 
                         all. He just had bad luck. He was 
                         doing pre-med at U.S.C. and working 
                         nights as an usher in a theater 
                         downtown. He got behind in his credits 
                         and flunked out. Then he lost his 
                         job for talking back. He's so hot-
                         headed.

                                     NEFF
                         That comes expensive, doesn't it?

                                     LOLA
                         I guess my father thinks nobody's 
                         good enough for his daughter except 
                         maybe the guy that owns Standard 
                         Oil. Would you like a stick of gum?

                                     NEFF
                         Never use it, thanks.

               Lola puts a stick of gum in her mouth.

                                     LOLA
                         I can't give Nino up. I wish father 
                         could see it my way.

                                     NEFF
                         It'll straighten out all right, Miss 
                         Dietrichson.

                                     LOLA
                         I suppose it will sometime.
                              (Looking out)
                         This is the corner right here, Mr. 
                         Neff.

               Neff brings the car to a stop by the curb.

                                     LOLA
                         There he is. By the bus stop.

               Neff looks out.

               B-6 CORNER VERMONT AND FRANKLIN - (NIGHT)

               Zachetti stands waiting, hands in trouser pockets. He is 
               about twenty-five, Italian looking, open shirt, not well 
               dressed.

               B-7 INT. COUPE - (NIGHT) - LOLA AND NEFF

                                     LOLA
                         He needs a hair-cut, doesn't he. 
                         Look at him. No job, no car, no money, 
                         no prospects, no nothing.
                              (Pause)
                         I love him.

               She leans over and honks on the horn.

                                     LOLA
                              (Calling)
                         Nino!

               B-8 ZACHETTI

               He turns around and looks towards the car.

                                     LOLA'S VOICE
                         Over here, Nino.

               Zachetti walks towards the car.

               B-9 THE COUPE

               Neff and Lola. She has opened the door. Zachetti comes up.

                                     LOLA
                         This is Mr. Neff, Nino.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Nino.

                                     ZACHETTI
                              (Belligerent from the 
                              first word)
                         The name is Zachetti.

                                     LOLA
                         Nino. Please. Mr. Neff gave me a 
                         ride from the house. I told him all 
                         about us.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Why does he have to get told about 
                         us?

                                     LOLA
                         We don't have to worry about Mr. 
                         Neff, Nino.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         I'm not doing any worrying. Just 
                         don't you broadcast so much.

                                     LOLA
                         What's the matter with you, Nino? 
                         He's a friend.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         I don't have any friends. And if I 
                         did, I like to pick them myself.

                                     NEFF
                         Look, sonny, she needed the ride and 
                         I brought her along. Is that anything 
                         to get tough about?

                                     ZACHETTI
                         All right, Lola, make up your mind. 
                         Are you coming or aren't you?

                                     LOLA
                         Of course I'm coming. Don't mind 
                         him, Mr. Neff.

               Lola steps out of the car.

                                     LOLA
                         Thanks a lot. You've been very sweet.

               Lola catches up with Zachetti and they walk away together.

               B-10 INT. COUPE

               Neff looks after them. Slowly he puts the car in gear and 
               drives on. His face is tight. Behind his head, light catches

               the COMMENTARY:

                         She was a nice kid and maybe he was 
                         a little better than he sounded. I 
                         kind of hoped so for her sake, but 
                         right then it gave me a nasty feeling 
                         to be thinking about them at all, 
                         with that briefcase right behind my 
                         head and her father's application in 
                         it. Besides, I had other problems to 
                         work out. There were plans to make, 
                         and Phyllis had to be in on them...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-11 EXT. SUPER MARKET - (DAY)

               There is a fair amount of activity but the place is not 
               crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot. He 
               passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes 
               between the stalls into the market.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Continued)
                         ...but we couldn't be seen together 
                         any more and I had told her never to 
                         call me from her house and never to 
                         call me at my office. So we had picked 
                         out a big market on Los Feliz. She 
                         was to be there buying stuff every 
                         day about eleven o'clock, and I could 
                         run into her there. Kind of 
                         accidentally on purpose.

               B-12 INT. MARKET

               Neff stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of 
               cigarettes. As he is opening the pack he looks back casually 
               beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market.

               B-13 ROWS OF HIGH SHELVES IN MARKET

               The shelves are loaded with canned goods and other 
               merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and 
               putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, 
               standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled. 
               She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large 
               envelope pocketbook under her arm.

               B-14 INT. MARKET

               Neff has spotted Phyllis. Without haste he passes through 
               the turnstile towards the back.

               B-15 THE SHELVES

               Phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. 
               Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards 
               her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer 
               passes and goes on out of scene. Phyllis and Neff are now 
               very close. During the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they 
               continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Not so loud.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I wanted to talk to you, Walter. 
                         Ever since yesterday.

                                     NEFF
                         Let me talk first. It's all set. The 
                         accident policy came through. I've 
                         got it in my pocket. I got his check 
                         too. I saw him down in the oil fields. 
                         He thought he was paying for the 
                         auto insurance. The check's just 
                         made out to the company. It could be 
                         for anything. But you have to send a 
                         check for the auto insurance, see. 
                         It's all right that way, because one 
                         of the cars is yours.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But listen, Walter ---

                                     NEFF
                         Quick, open your bag.

               She hesitates, then opens it. Neff looks around quickly, 
               slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her 
               bag. She snaps the bag shut.

                                     NEFF
                         Can you get into his safe deposit 
                         box?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. We both have keys.

                                     NEFF
                         Fine. But don't put the policy in 
                         there yet. I'll tell you when. And 
                         listen, you never touched it or even 
                         saw it, understand?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm not a fool.

                                     NEFF
                         Okay. When is he taking the train?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, that's just it. He isn't 
                         going.

                                     NEFF
                         What?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's what I've been trying to tell 
                         you. The trip is off.

                                     NEFF
                         What's happened?

               He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in 
               a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside 
               Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis 
               puts a few cakes of soap into her basket.

                                     WOMAN
                              (To Neff)
                         Mister, could you reach me that can 
                         of coffee?
                              (She points)
                         That one up there.

                                     NEFF
                              (Reaching up)
                         This one?

               She nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and 
               hands it to her.

                                     WOMAN
                         I don't see why they always have to 
                         put what I want on the top shelf.

               She moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the 
               corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to 
               Phyllis again.

                                     NEFF
                         Go ahead. I'm listening.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He had a fall down at the well. He 
                         broke his leg. It's in a cast.

                                     NEFF
                         That knocks it on the head all right.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What do we do, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Nothing. Just wait.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Wait for what?

                                     NEFF
                         Until he can take a train. I told 
                         you it's got to be a train.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         We can't wait. I can't go on like 
                         this.

                                     NEFF
                         We're not going to grab a hammer and 
                         do it quick, just to get it over 
                         with.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         There are other ways.

                                     NEFF
                         Only we're not going to do it other 
                         ways.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But we can't leave it like this. 
                         What do you think would happen if he 
                         found out about this accident policy?

                                     NEFF
                         Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in 
                         that death-house.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't ever talk like that, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Just don't let's start losing our 
                         heads.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's not our heads. It's our nerve 
                         we're losing.

                                     NEFF
                         We're going to do it right. That's 
                         all I said.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter maybe it's my nerves. It's 
                         the waiting that gets me.

                                     NEFF
                         It's getting me just as bad, baby. 
                         But we've got to wait.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe we have, Walter. Only it's so 
                         tough without you. It's like a wall 
                         between us.

               Neff looks at his watch.

                                     NEFF
                         Good-bye baby. I'm thinking of you 
                         every minute.

               He goes off. She stares after him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-16 NEFF'S OFFICE - (DAY)

               He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. He is 
               standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few 
               papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate 
               book, making a quick telephone call. But nothing of this is 
               heard.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         After that a full week went by and I 
                         didn't see her once. I tried to keep 
                         my mind off her and off the whole 
                         idea. I kept telling myself that 
                         maybe those fates they say watch 
                         over you had gotten together and 
                         broken his leg to give me a way out. 
                         Then it was the fifteenth of June. 
                         You may remember that date, Keyes. I 
                         do too, only for a very different 
                         reason. You came into my office around 
                         three in the afternoon...

               Keyes enters with some papers in his hand.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         I just came from Norton's office. 
                         The semi-annual sales records are 
                         out. You're high man, Walter. That's 
                         twice in a row. Congratulations.

                                     NEFF
                         Thanks. How would you like a cheap 
                         drink?

                                     KEYES
                         How would you like a fifty dollar 
                         cut in salary?

                                     NEFF
                         How would I -- Do I laugh now, or 
                         wait until it gets funny?

                                     KEYES
                         I'm serious, Walter. I've been talking 
                         to Norton. There's too much stuff 
                         piling up on my desk. Too much 
                         pressure on my nerves. I spend half 
                         the night walking up and down in my 
                         bed. I've got to have an assistant. 
                         I thought that you --

                         Me? Why pick on me?

                                     KEYES
                         Because I've got a crazy idea you 
                         might be good at the job.

                                     NEFF
                         That's crazy all right. I'm a 
                         salesman.

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. A peddler, a glad-hander, a 
                         back-slapper. You're too good to be 
                         a salesman.

                                     NEFF
                         Nobody's too good to be a salesman.

                                     KEYES
                         Phooey. All you guys do is ring door-
                         bells and dish out a smooth line of 
                         monkey talk. What's bothering you is 
                         that fifty buck cut, isn't it?

                                     NEFF
                         That'd bother anybody.

                                     KEYES
                         Look, Walter. The job I'm talking 
                         about takes brains and integrity. It 
                         takes more guts than there is in 
                         fifty salesman. It's the hottest job 
                         in the business.

                                     NEFF
                         It's still a desk job. I don't want 
                         a desk job.

                                     KEYES
                         A desk job. Is that all you can see 
                         in it? Just a hard chair to park 
                         your pants on from nine to five. 
                         Just a pile of papers to shuffle 
                         around, and five sharp pencils and a 
                         scratch pad to make figures on, with 
                         maybe a little doodling on the side. 
                         That's not the way I see it, Walter. 
                         To me a claims man is a surgeon, and 
                         that desk is an operating table, and 
                         those pencils are scalpels and bone 
                         chisels. And those papers are not 
                         just forms and statistics and claims 
                         for compensation. They're alive, 
                         they're packed with drama, with 
                         twisted hopes and crooked dreams. A 
                         claims man, Walter, is a doctor and 
                         a blood-hound and a cop and a judge 
                         and a jury and a father confessor, 
                         all in one.

               The telephone rings on Neff's desk. Automatically Keyes grabs 
               the phone and answers.

                                     KEYES
                         Who? Okay, hold the line.

               He puts the phone down on the desk and continues to Neff:

                                     KEYES
                         And you want to tell me you're not 
                         interested. You don't want to work 
                         with your brains. All you want to 
                         work with is your finger on a door-
                         bell. For a few bucks more a week. 
                         There's a dame on your phone.

               Neff picks the phone up and answers.

                                     NEFF
                         Walter Neff speaking.

               B-17 INT. PHONE BOOTH - MARKET

               Phyllis is on the phone.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I had to call you, Walter. It's 
                         terribly urgent. Are you with 
                         somebody?

               B-18 NEFF'S OFFICE

               Neff on the phone. His eye catches Keyes', who is walking up 
               and down.

                                     NEFF
                         Of course I am. Can't I call you 
                         back... Margie?

                         Walter, I've only got a minute. It 
                         can't wait. Listen. He's going 
                         tonight. On the train. Are you 
                         listening, Walter? Walter!

               B-20 NEFF - ON PHONE

               His eyes are on Keyes. He speaks into the phone as calmly as 
               possible.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm listening. Only make it short... 
                         Margie.

                         He's on crutches. The doctor says he 
                         can go if he's careful. The change 
                         will do him good. It's wonderful, 
                         Walter. Just the way you wanted it. 
                         Only with the crutches it's ever so 
                         much better, isn't it?

               B-22 NEFF'S OFFICE

               Neff on phone.

                                     NEFF
                         One hundred percent better. Hold the 
                         line a minute.

               He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who 
               is now standing at the window.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose I join you in your office, 
                         Keyes --

               He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes 
               stays right where he is.

                                     KEYES
                         I'll wait. Only tell Margie not to 
                         take all day.

               Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then 
               lifts the phone again.

                                     NEFF
                         Go ahead.

                         It's the ten-fifteen from Glendale. 
                         I'm driving him. Is it still that 
                         same dark street?

               B-24 NEFF, ON PHONE

               He is still watching Keyes cautiously.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah -- sure.

                         Color?
                              (She catches on)
                         Oh, sure. The blue suit, Walter. 
                         Navy blue. And the cast on his left 
                         leg.

               B-26 NEFF, ON PHONE

                                     NEFF
                         Navy blue. I like that fine.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         This is it, Walter. I'm shaking like 
                         a leaf. But it's straight down the 
                         line now for both of us. I love you, 
                         Walter. Goodbye.

               B-28 NEFF'S OFFICE

               Neff on the phone.

                                     NEFF
                         So long, Margie.

               He hangs up. His mouth is grim, but he forces a smile as 
               Keyes turns.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm sorry, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         What's the matter? The dames chasing 
                         you again? Or still? Or is it none 
                         of my business?

                                     NEFF
                              (With a sour smile)
                         If I told you it was a customer --

                                     KEYES
                         Margie! I bet she drinks from the 
                         bottle. Why don't you settle down 
                         and get married, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Why don't you, for instance?

                                     KEYES
                         I almost did, once. A long time ago.

               Neff gets up from his desk.

                                     NEFF
                         Look, Keyes, I've got a prospect to 
                         call on.

               Keyes drives right ahead.

                                     KEYES
                         We even had the church all picked 
                         out, the dame and I. She had a white 
                         satin dress with flounces on it. And 
                         I was on my way to the jewelry store 
                         to buy the ring. Then suddenly that 
                         little man in here started working 
                         on me.

               He punches his stomach with his fist.

                                     NEFF
                         So you went back and started 
                         investigating her. That it?

               Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed.

                                     KEYES
                         And the stuff that came out. She'd 
                         been dyeing her hair ever since she 
                         was sixteen. And there was a manic-
                         depressive in her family, on her 
                         mother's side. And she already had 
                         one husband, a professional pool 
                         player in Baltimore. And as for her 
                         brother --

                                     NEFF
                         I get the general idea. She was a 
                         tramp from a long line of tramps.

               He picks up some papers impatiently.

                                     KEYES
                         All right, I'm going. What am I to 
                         say to Norton? How about that job I 
                         want you for?

                                     NEFF
                         I don't think I want it. Thanks, 
                         Keyes, just the same.

                                     KEYES
                         Fair enough. Just get this: I picked 
                         you for the job, not because I think 
                         you're so darn smart, but because I 
                         thought maybe you were a shade less 
                         dumb than the rest of the outfit. I 
                         guess I was all wet. You're not 
                         smarter, Walter. You're just a little 
                         taller.

               He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then 
               turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper 
               cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. 
               After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into 
               the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. 

               He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on 
               the desk. He buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls 
               his tie right. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under 
               his arm.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         That was it, Keyes, and there was no 
                         use kidding myself any more. Those 
                         fates I was talking about had only 
                         been stalling me off. Now they had 
                         thrown the switch. The gears had 
                         meshed. The machinery had started to 
                         move and nothing could stop it. The 
                         time for thinking had all run out. 
                         From here on it was a question of 
                         following the time table, move by 
                         move, just as we had it rehearsed. I 
                         wanted my time all accounted for for 
                         the rest of the afternoon and up to 
                         the last possible moment in the 
                         evening. So I arranged to call on a 
                         prospect in Pasadena about a public 
                         liability bond. When I left the office 
                         I put my rate book on the desk as if 
                         I had forgotten it. That was part of 
                         the alibi.

               B-29 EXT. NEFF'S APT. HOUSE DAY

               Neff's coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage 
               and goes down the ramp into the basement.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         I got home about seven and drove 
                         right into the garage. This was 
                         another item to establish my alibi.

               B-30 INT. GARAGE

               There are about eight cars parked. A colored attendant in 
               coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and 
               sponge. Neff's car comes into the shot and stops near the 
               attendant. Neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Hiya there, Mr. Neff.

                                     NEFF
                         How about a wash job on my heap, 
                         Charlie?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         How soon you want it, Mr. Neff? I 
                         got two cars ahead of you.

                                     NEFF
                         Anytime you get to it, Charlie. I'm 
                         staying in tonight.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Okay, Mr. Neff. Be all shined up for 
                         you in the morning.

               Neff is crossing to the elevator. He speaks back over his 
               shoulder:

                                     NEFF
                         That left front tire looks a little 
                         soft. Check it, will you?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You bet. Check 'em all round. Always 
                         do.

               Neff enters the elevator.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-31 NEFF'S APT. - (DAY)

               Neff enters. He walks straight to the phone, dials, and starts 
               speaking into the mouthpiece, but only the COMMENTARY is 
               heard.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

                         Up in my apartment I called Lou 
                         Schwartz, one of the salesmen that 
                         shared my office. He lived in 
                         Westwood. That made it a toll call 
                         and there'd be a record of it. I 
                         told him I had forgotten my rate 
                         book and needed some dope on the 
                         public liability bond I was figuring. 
                         I asked him to call me back. This 
                         was another item in my alibi, so 
                         that later on I could prove that I 
                         had been home.

               B-32 INT. NEFF'S LIVING ROOM

               Neff comes into the living room from the bedroom, putting on 
               the jacket of his blue suit. THE PHONE RINGS. He picks up 
               the receiver and starts talking, unheard, as before. He makes 
               notes on a pad.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                         I changed into a navy blue suit like 
                         Dietrichson was going to wear. Lou 
                         Schwartz called me back and gave me 
                         a lot of figures...

               B-33 NEFF

               He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket 
               pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts 
               that into his pants pocket.

                              (Cont'd)
                         I stuffed a hand towel and a big 
                         roll of adhesive tape into my pockets, 
                         so I could fake something that looked 
                         like a cast on a broken leg... Next 
                         I fixed the telephone and the 
                         doorbell, so that the cards would 
                         fall down if the bells rang. That 
                         way I would know there had been a 
                         phone call or visitor while I was 
                         away. I left the apartment house by 
                         the fire stairs and side door. Nobody 
                         saw me. It was already getting dark. 
                         I took the Vermont Avenue bus to Los 
                         Feliz and walked from there up to 
                         the Dietrichson house. There was 
                         that smell of honeysuckle again, 
                         only stronger, now that it was 
                         evening.

               B-34 & B-35 INSERTS OF OPEN TELEPHONE BELL BOX (ON BASEBOARD) 
               & DOORBELL (ABOVE ENTRANCE DOOR)

               Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in 
               each of these.

               B-36 FIRE STAIRS, APT. HOUSE (NIGHT)

               CAMERA PANS with Neff going down the stairs in his blue suit, 
               with a hat pulled down over his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-37 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT) - LONG SHOT - NO 
               TRAFFIC

               Some windows are lit. Neff comes into the shot and approaches 
               cautiously. He looks around and then slides open the garage 
               door.

               B-38 INT. GARAGE

               Neff closes the garage door. Very faint light comes in at a 
               side window. He opens the rear door of the sedan, gets in 
               and closes the door after him. The dark interior of the car 
               has swallowed him up.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Then I was in the garage. His car 
                         was backed in, just the way I told 
                         Phyllis to have it. It was so still 
                         I could hear the ticking of the clock 
                         on the dashboard. I kept thinking of 
                         the place we had picked out to do 
                         it, that dark street on the way to 
                         the station, and the three honks on 
                         the horn that were to be the signal... 
                         About ten minutes later they came 
                         down.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-39 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOUSE

               The front door has opened and Dietrichson is half-way down 
               the steps. He is walking with crutches, wearing the dark 
               blue suit and a hat. The cast is on his left leg. There is 
               no shoe on his left foot. Only the white plaster shows. 
               Phyllis comes after him, carrying his suitcase and his 
               overcoat. She wears a camel's-hair coat and no hat. She 
               catches up with him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You all right, honey? I'll have the 
                         car out in a second.

               Dietrichson just grunts. She passes him to the garage, CAMERA 
               WITH HER, and slides the door open.

               B-40 INT. GARAGE

               THE CAMERA IS VERY LOW INSIDE THE SEDAN, shooting slightly 
               upwards from Neff's hiding place. The garage door has just 
               been opened. Phyllis comes to the car, opens the rear door. 
               She looks down, almost INTO THE CAMERA. A tight, cool smile 
               flashes across her face. Then, very calmly, she puts the 
               suitcase and overcoat in back on the seat (out of shot). She 
               closes the door again.

               B-41 EXT. GARAGE

               Dietrichson stands watching Phyllis as she gets into the car 
               and drives out to pick him up. She stops beside him and opens 
               the right-hand door. Dietrichson climbs in with difficulty. 
               She helps him, watching him closely.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Take it easy, honey. We've got lots 
                         of time.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Just let me do it my own way. Grab 
                         that crutch.

               She takes one of the crutches from him.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         They ought to make these things so 
                         they fold up.

               For a moment, as he leans his hand on the back of the seat, 
               there is danger that he may see Neff. He doesn't. He slides 
               awkwardly into the seat and pulls the second crutch in after 
               him. He closes the door. The car moves off.

               Phyllis driving and Dietrichson beside her, face TOWARDS THE 
               CAMERA. Dietrichson has a partly smoked cigar between his 
               teeth. They are in the middle of a conversation.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Aw, stop squawkin' can't you, Phyllis? 
                         No man takes his wife along to a 
                         class reunion. That's what class 
                         reunions are for.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Mrs. Tucker went along with her 
                         husband last year, didn't she.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Yeah, and what happened to her? She 
                         sat in the hotel lobby for four days 
                         straight. Never even saw the guy 
                         until we poured him back on the train.

               DIETRICHSON

               His face is partly covered by the edge of a traveling rug 
               which he has pulled up over him. He looks up at Dietrichson 
               and Phyllis in the front seat.

                         All right, honey. Just so long as 
                         you have a good time.

                         I won't do much dancing, I can tell

                         Remember what the doctor said. If 
                         you get careless you might end up 
                         with a shorter leg.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         So what? I could break the other one 
                         and match them up again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It makes you feel pretty good to get

                         It's only for four days. I'll be 
                         back Monday at the latest.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't forget we're having the Hobeys 
                         for dinner on Monday.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         The Hobeys? We had them last. They 
                         owe us a dinner, don't they?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe they do but I've already asked 
                         them for Monday.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Well, I don't want to feed the Hobeys.

               B-46 CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS' FACE ONLY

               There is a look of tension in her eyes now. She glances around 
               quickly. The car has reached the dark street Neff and she 
               picked out.

                                     DIETRICHSON'S VOICE
                         And I don't want to eat at their 
                         house either. The food you get there, 
                         and that rope he hands out for cigars. 
                         Call it off, can't you?

               Phyllis does not answer. She doesn't even breathe. Her hand 
               goes down on the horn button. She honks three times.

                                     DIETRICHSON'S VOICE
                         What are you doing that for? What 
                         the --

               This is as far as his voice will ever get. It breaks off and 
               dies down in a muffled groan. There are struggling noises 
               and a dull sound of something breaking. Phyllis drives on 
               and never turns her head. She stares straight in front of 
               her. Her teeth are clenched.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-47 PARKING SPACE ADJOINING GLENDALE STATION - NIGHT

               The station is visible about sixty yards away. There is no 
               parking attendant. Ten or twelve cars are parked diagonally, 
               not crowded. The train is not in yet, but there is activity 
               around the station. Passengers and their friends, redcaps 
               and baggage men, news vendors, etc.

               The Dietrichson sedan drives into the shot past CAMERA and 
               parks in the foreground at the outer end of the line, several 
               spaces from the next car, facing away from the CAMERA. Both 
               front doors are open. Phyllis gets out and from the other 
               side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind, 
               and apparently Dietrichson) climbs out awkwardly. While he 
               is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, Phyllis 
               has taken out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat. She walks 
               around the car and rolls up the right front window. She closes 
               and locks the car door. She tries the right rear door and 
               takes a last look into the dim interior of the car. Then she 
               and the man walk slowly away from the car to the end of the 
               station platform and along it toward the station building, 
               Phyllis walks several steps ahead of the man.

               B-48 PHYLLIS & THE MAN - WALKING

               CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM, a little to one side, so that Phyllis 
               is clearly seen but the man's face is not.

                                     MAN
                              (In a subdued voice)
                         You handle the redcap and the 
                         conductor.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't worry.

                                     MAN
                         Keep them away from me as much as 
                         you can. I don't want to be helped.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I said don't worry, Walter.

               B-49 PHYLLIS & THE MAN, WALKING DOWN PLATFORM, CAMERA NOW 
               PRECEDING THEM

               Only at this point is it quite clear that THE MAN IS NEFF.

                                     NEFF
                         You start just as soon as the train 
                         leaves. At the dairy sign you turn 
                         off the highway onto the dirt road. 
                         From there it's exactly eight-tenths 
                         of a mile to the dump beside the 
                         tracks. Remember?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I remember everything.

                                     NEFF
                         You'll be there a little ahead of 
                         the train. No speeding. You don't 
                         want any cops stopping you -- with 
                         him in the back.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, we've been through all that 
                         so many times.

                                     NEFF
                         When you turn off the highway, cut 
                         all your lights. I'm going to be 
                         back on the observation platform. 
                         I'll drop off as close to the spot 
                         as I can. Wait for the train to pass, 
                         then blink your lights twice.

               Phyllis nods. They go on. Over them is heard the noise of 
               the train coming into the station and its lights are seen.

               B-50 GLENDALE STATION PLATFORM

               The train is just coming to a stop. The passengers move 
               forward to the tracks. Phyllis, carrying the suitcase and 
               overcoat, and Neff, still a little behind her, come TOWARDS 
               THE CAMERA. A redcap sees them and runs up. He takes the 
               suitcase out of Phyllis' hand.

                                     REDCAP
                         San Francisco train, lady?

               Phyllis takes an envelope containing Dietrichson's ticket 
               from the pocket of the overcoat. She reads from the envelope.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Car nine, section eleven. Just my 
                         husband going.

                                     REDCAP
                         Car nine, section eleven. Yessum, 
                         this way please.

               Phyllis hands the overcoat to the redcap, who leads her and 
               Neff towards car number nine. Neff still hangs back and keeps 
               his head down, the way a man using crutches might naturally 
               do.

               B-51 EXT. CAR #9: B-52: B-53

               The pullman conductor and porter stand at the steps. The 
               conductor is checking the tickets of passengers getting on. 
               The redcap leads Phyllis and Neff into the SHOT. The conductor 
               and porter see Neff on his crutches and move to help him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's all right, thanks. My husband 
                         doesn't like to be helped.

               The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously 
               swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, 
               keeping his head down. Meantime, Phyllis is holding the 
               attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the 
               ticket.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Car nine, section eleven. The 
                         gentleman only. Thank you.

               Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the 
               top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the 
               ticket. They are now close together.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Goodbye, honey. Take awful good care 
                         of yourself with that leg.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, I will. Just you take it easy 
                         going home.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'll miss you, honey.

               She kisses him. There are shouts of "ALL ABOARD". The redcap 
               comes from inside the car.

                                     REDCAP
                         Section eleven, suh.

               Phyllis takes a quarter from her bag and gives it to the 
               redcap.

                                     PORTER
                              (Shouting)
                         All aboard!

               Redcap descends. Phyllis kisses Neff again quickly.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Good luck, honey.

               She runs down the steps. The porter picks up the box. He and 
               the conductor get on board the train. Phyllis stands there 
               waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter 
               begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of 
               the shot in the direction of the parked car.

               B-54 INT. PLATFORM CAR NUMBER NINE - MOVING TRAIN - (NIGHT) - 
               DIM LIGHT

               Neff and the Porter. The conductor is going on into the car. 
               Neff is half turned away from the porter.

                                     NEFF
                         Can you make up my berth right away?

                                     PORTER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm going back to the observation 
                         car for a smoke.

                                     PORTER
                         This way, sir. Three cars back.

               He holds the vestibule door open. Neff hobbles through.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-55 INT. PULLMAN CAR - DIM

               Most of the berths are made up. As Neff hobbles along, another 
               porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man 
               solicitously.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-56 PLATFORM BETWEEN TWO CARS - VERY DIM

               The train conductor meets Neff and opens the door for him. 
               Neff hobbles on through.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-57 INT. PARLOR CAR - MOVING TRAIN

               Four or five passengers are reading or writing. As Neff comes 
               through on his crutches they pull in their feet to make room 
               for him. One old lady, seeing that he is headed for the 
               observation platform, opens the door for him. He thanks her 
               with a nod and hobbles through.

               B-58 OBSERVATION PLATFORM

               Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor 
               car. The train is going at about fifteen miles an hour between 
               Glendale and Burbank. Neff has come out and hobbled to the 
               railing. He stands looking back along the rails. SUDDENLY A 
               MAN'S VOICE speaks from behind him.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Can I pull a chair out for you?

               Neff looks around. He sees a man sitting in the corner smoking 
               a hand-rolled cigarette. He is about fifty-five years old, 
               with white hair, and a broad-brimmed Stetson hat. He looks 
               like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man. Neff does 
               not like the man's presence there very much. He turns to him 
               just enough to answer.

                                     NEFF
                         No thanks, I'd rather stand.

                                     MAN
                         You going far?

                                     NEFF
                         Palo Alto.

                                     MAN
                         My name's Jackson. I'm going all the 
                         way to Medford. Medford, Oregon. Had 
                         a broken arm myself once.

                                     NEFF
                         Uh-huh.

                                     JACKSON
                         That darn cast sure itches something 
                         fierce, don't it? I thought I'd go 
                         crazy with mine.

               Neff stands silent. His mind is feverishly thinking of how 
               to get rid of Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                         Palo Alto's a nice little town. You 
                         a Stanford man?

                                     NEFF
                         Used to be.

               He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something.

                                     JACKSON
                         I bet you left something behind. I 
                         always do.

                                     NEFF
                         My cigar case. Must have left it in 
                         my overcoat back in the section.

               Jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of 
               cigarette papers.

                                     JACKSON
                         Care to roll yourself a cigarette, 
                         Mr. --?

                                     NEFF
                         Dietrichson. Thanks. I really prefer 
                         cigars.
                              (Looking around)
                         Maybe the porter --

                                     JACKSON
                         I could get your cigars for you. Be 
                         glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     NEFF
                         That's darn nice of you. It's car 
                         nine, section eleven. If you're sure 
                         it's not too much trouble.

                                     JACKSON
                         Car nine, section eleven. A pleasure.

               He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly 
               and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves 
               to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track 
               to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the 
               parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the 
               crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He 
               drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly 
               swings his body over the rail.

               B-59 EXT. MOVING OBSERVATION CAR - CAMERA FOLLOWING

               Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets 
               go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train 
               recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. 
               He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the 
               line of the tracks and off to one side.

               B-60 DARK LANDSCAPE - RAILROAD TRACKS

               Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of 
               a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the 
               Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out.

               B-61 NEFF

               He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly 
               because of the improvised cast on his left foot.

               B-62 CAR IN THE DARK

               The front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the 
               door and looks in the direction of the tracks. The uneven 
               steps of Neff running towards her are heard. She opens the 
               back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the 
               corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the 
               car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the 
               same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The 
               running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the SHOT 
               breathing hard. He reaches her.

                                     NEFF
                         Okay. This has to go fast. Take his 
                         hat and pick up the crutches.

               Neff points back towards the tracks. He reaches into the car 
               and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. Phyllis coolly 
               reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. 
               She turns to go.

                                     NEFF
                         Hang on to that rug. I'll need it.

               Phyllis moves out of the shot carrying the hat and rug.

               B-63 NEFF

               He gets a stronger hold on the dead Dietrichson and drags 
               him free of the car and towards the tracks. The corpse is 
               not seen.

               B-64 PHYLLIS

               She has reached the point where one of the crutches lies. 
               She picks it up and goes for the other crutch a short distance 
               away. She carries both crutches, the hat and the rug towards 
               Neff.

               B-65 NEFF

               He has reached the railroad tracks. The corpse is lying beside 
               the tracks, face down. Phyllis comes up to Neff. He takes 
               the crutches and the hat from her. He throws the crutches 
               beside the corpse. He takes the hat from Phyllis and tosses 
               it carelessly along the track.

                                     NEFF
                         Let's go. Stay behind me.

               He takes the rug from her and they move back towards the 
               car, Phyllis first, then Neff walking almost backwards, 
               sweeping the ground over which the body was dragged with the 
               rug as they go.

               B-66 THE CAR

               They reach it together.

                                     NEFF
                         Get in. You drive.

               She gets in. Neff sweeps the ground after him as he goes 
               around the car to get in beside her. He throws the rug into 
               the back of the car.

               B-67 INT. CAR

               Phyllis is behind the wheel. Neff beside her is just closing 
               the door. He props his wrapped foot against the dashboard 
               and begins to tear off the adhesive tape while at the same 
               time Phyllis presses the starter button. The starter grinds, 
               but the motor doesn't catch. She tries again. It still doesn't 
               catch. Neff looks at her. She tries a third time. The starter 
               barely turns over. The battery is very low.

               Phyllis leans back. They stare at each other desperately. 
               After a moment Neff bends forward slowly and turns the 
               ignition key to the OFF position. He holds his left thumb 
               poised over the starter button. There is a breathless moment. 
               Then he presses the starter button with swift decision. The 
               starter grinds with nerve-wracking sluggishness. Neff twists 
               the ignition key to ON and instantly pulls the hand-throttle 
               wide open. With a last feeble kick of the starter, the motor 
               catches and races. He eases the throttle down and slides 
               back into his place. They look at each other again. The 
               tenseness of the moment still shows in their faces.

                                     NEFF
                         Let's go, baby.

               Phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse. 
               Neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg. The car 
               moves.

               B-68 DARK LANDSCAPE - WITH DUMP

               The car, with the headlights out, backs up, swings around 
               and moves off along the dirt road the way it came.

               Phyllis and Neff facing towards CAMERA. Neff is bent over, 
               peeling the towel and plaster off his foot, which is out of 
               shot. Phyllis is calm, almost relaxed. Neff straightens up. 
               They are talking to each other. Their lips are seen moving 
               but what they say is not heard. They stop talking. Phyllis 
               stares straight ahead. Neff is pulling adhesive tape off the 
               wrapped towel that was on his foot. He folds the adhesive 
               into a tight ball, rolls the towel up, puts both into his 
               pockets.

                         On the way back we went over once 
                         more what she was to do at the 
                         inquest, if they had one, and about 
                         the insurance, when that came up. I 
                         was afraid she might go to pieces a 
                         little, now that we had done it, but 
                         she was perfect. No nerves. Not a 
                         tear, not even a blink of the eyes...

               B-70 DARK STREET NEAR NEFF'S APT. HOUSE

               The sedan drives into the shot and stops without pulling 
               over to the curb.

                         She dropped me a block from my 
                         apartment house.

               The car door opens. Neff starts to get out.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter.

               Neff turns back to her.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's the matter, Walter. Aren't 
                         you going to kiss me?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, I'm going to kiss you.

               Phyllis bends towards him and puts her arms around him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's straight down the line, isn't 
                         it?

               Phyllis kisses him. In the kiss he is passive.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I love you, Walter.

                         It was two minutes past eleven as I 
                         went up the fire stairs again. Nobody 
                         saw me this time either.

                         The cards hadn't moved. No calls. No

               Neff comes from the bedroom, wearing the light grey suit he 
               wore before the murder, only with out a tie. He buttons his 
               jacket, looks around the room, and opens the corridor door.

                         I changed the blue suit. There was 
                         one last thing to do. I wanted the 
                         garage man to see me again.

               Fifteen or twenty cars are parked now. Charlie, the attendant 
               has washed Neff's car and is now polishing the glass and 
               metal work. Neff comes from the elevator. Charlie sees him. 
               He straightens up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You going to need it after all, Mr. 
                         Neff? I'm about through.

                                     NEFF
                         It's okay, Charlie. Just walking 
                         down to the drug store for something 
                         to eat. Been working upstairs all 
                         evening. My stomach's getting sore 
                         at me.

               He walks up the ramp towards the garage entrance.

               B-76 STREET OUTSIDE APT. HOUSE - (NIGHT) - SHOOTING TOWARDS 
               GARAGE ENTRANCE

               Neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk 
               down the street, not too fast. CAMERA PRECEDES HIM. He walks 
               about ten or fifteen yards. At first his steps sound hard 
               and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. 
               But slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. He 
               walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the 
               silence. He stops rigidly and looks back. CAMERA STOPS WITH 
               HIM. He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the 
               CAMERA again. There is a look of horror on his face now. He 
               walks on, CAMERA AHEAD OF HIM again. Still his steps make no 
               sound.

                         That was all there was to it. Nothing 
                         had slipped, nothing had been 
                         overlooked, there was nothing to 
                         give us away. And yet, Keyes, as I 
                         was walking down the street to the 
                         drug store, suddenly it came over me 
                         that everything would go wrong. It 
                         sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, 
                         so help me: I couldn't hear my own 
                         footsteps. It was the walk of a dead 
                         man.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               C-1 NEFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Neff sits before the dictaphone. There are four cylinders on 
               end on the desk next to him. He gets up from the swivel chair 
               with great effort and stands a moment unsteadily. The wound 
               in his shoulder is paining him. He is very weak as he slowly 
               crosses to the water cooler. He takes the blood stained 
               handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh 
               water.

               The office door opens behind him. He turns, hiding the 
               handkerchief behind his back. In the doorway stands the 
               colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs. He is 
               carrying his big trash box by a rope handle.

                                     COLORED MAN
                         Didn't know anybody was here, Mr. 
                         Neff. We ain't cleaned your office 
                         yet.

                                     NEFF
                         Let it go tonight. I'm busy.

                                     COLORED MAN
                         Whatever you say, Mr. Neff.

               He closes the door slowly, staring at Neff with an uneasy 
               expression. Neff puts the soaked handkerchief back on his 
               wounded shoulder, then walks heavily over to his swivel chair 
               and lowers himself into it. He takes the dictaphone horn and 
               speaks into it again.

                                     NEFF
                         That was the longest night I ever 
                         lived through, Keyes, and the next 
                         day was worse, when the story broke 
                         in the papers, and they were talking 
                         about it at the office, and the day 
                         after that when you started digging 
                         into it. I kept my hands in my pockets 
                         because I thought they were shaking, 
                         and I put on dark glasses so people 
                         couldn't see my eyes, and then I 
                         took them off again so people wouldn't 
                         get to wondering why I wore them. I 
                         was trying to hold myself together, 
                         but I could feel my nerves pulling 
                         me to pieces....

               C-2 INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - DAY

               Neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on 
               and his briefcase under his arm. He walks towards his office, 
               but half way there he runs into Keyes. Keyes is wearing his 
               vest and hat, no coat. He is carrying a file of papers and 
               smoking a cigar.

                                     KEYES
                         Come on, Walter. The big boss wants 
                         to see us.

                         Okay.

               He turns and walks beside Keyes, CAMERA AHEAD of them

                         That Dietrichson case?

                         Must be.

                                     NEFF
                         Anything wrong?

                                     KEYES
                         The guy's dead, we had him insured 
                         and it's going to cost us money. 
                         That's always wrong.

               He stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil 
               from his vest. He stands over the jar extinguishing his cigar 
               carefully so as not to damage it.

                                     NEFF
                         What have you got so far?

                                     KEYES
                         Autopsy report. No heart failure, no 
                         apoplexy, no predisposing medical 
                         cause of any kind. He died of a broken 
                         neck.

                                     NEFF
                         When is the inquest?

                                     KEYES
                         They had it this morning. His wife 
                         and daughter made the identification. 
                         The train people and some passengers 
                         told how he went through to the 
                         observation car.. It was all over in 
                         forty-five minutes. Verdict, 
                         accidental death.

               Keyes puts the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with 
               the pencil. They move on.

                                     NEFF
                         What do the police figure?

                                     KEYES
                         That he got tangled up in his crutches 
                         and fell off the train. They're 
                         satisfied. It's not their dough.

               They stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium letters: 
               EDWARD S. NORTON, JR. PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the door. They 
               go in.

               C-3 INT. RECEPTION ROOM - MR. NORTON'S OFFICE

               A secretary sitting behind a desk. As Keyes and Neff enter, 
               the door to Norton's private office is opened. From inside, 
               Mr. Norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen. 
               Norton is about forty-five, very well groomed, rather pompous 
               in manner.

                                     NORTON
                              (To the men who are 
                              leaving)
                         I believe the legal position is now 
                         clear, gentlemen. Please stand by. I 
                         may need you later.

               He sees Keyes and Neff.

                                     NORTON
                         Come in, Mr. Keyes. You too, Mr. 
                         Neff.

               Neff has put down his hat and briefcase. He and Keyes pass 
               the legal looking men and follow Norton into his office.

               C-4 INT. NORTON'S OFFICE

               Naturally it is the best office in the building; modern but 
               not modernistic, spacious, very well furnished; flowers, 
               smoking stands, easy chairs, etc. Norton has gone behind his 
               desk. Keyes has come in, and Neff after him closes the door 
               quietly. Norton looks disapprovingly at Keyes' shirt sleeves.

                                     NORTON
                         You find this an uncomfortably warm 
                         day Mr. Keyes?

               Keyes takes his hat off but holds it in his hands.

                                     KEYES
                         Sorry, Mr. Norton. I didn't know 
                         this was formal.

               Norton smiles frostily.

                                     NORTON
                         Sit down, gentlemen.
                              (To Keyes)
                         Any new developments?

               Keyes and Neff sit down, Norton remains standing.

                                     KEYES
                         I just talked to this Jackson long 
                         distance. Up in Medford, Oregon.

                                     NORTON
                         Who's Jackson?

                                     KEYES
                         The last guy that saw Dietrichson 
                         alive. They were out on the 
                         observation platform together talking. 
                         Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson 
                         went to get Dietrichson's cigar case 
                         for him. When he came back to the 
                         observation platform, no Dietrichson. 
                         Jackson didn't think anything was 
                         wrong until a wire caught up with 
                         the train at Santa Barbara. They had 
                         found Dietrichson's body on the tracks 
                         near Burbank.

                                     NORTON
                         Very interesting, about the cigar 
                         case.

               He walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard.

                                     NORTON
                         Anything else?

                                     KEYES
                         Not much. Dietrichson's secretary 
                         says she didn't know anything about 
                         the policy. There is a daughter, but 
                         all she remembers is Neff talking to 
                         her father about accident insurance 
                         at their house one night.

                                     NEFF
                         I couldn't sell him at first. Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson opposed it. He told me 
                         he'd think it over. Later on I went 
                         down to the oil fields and closed 
                         him. He signed the application and 
                         gave me his check.

                                     NORTON
                              (Dripping with sarcasm)
                         A fine piece of salesmanship that 
                         was, Mr. Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         There's no sense in pushing Neff 
                         around. He's got the best sales record 
                         in the office. Are your salesmen 
                         supposed to know that the customer 
                         is going to fall off a train?

                                     NORTON
                         Fall off a train? Are we sure 
                         Dietrichson fell off the train?

               There is a charged pause.

                                     KEYES
                         I don't get it.

                                     NORTON
                         You don't, Mr. Keyes? Then what do 
                         you think of this case? This policy 
                         might cost us a great deal of money. 
                         As you know, it contains a double 
                         indemnity clause. Just what is your 
                         opinion?

                                     KEYES
                         No opinion at all.

                                     NORTON
                         Not even a hunch? One of those 
                         interesting little hunches of yours?

                                     KEYES
                         Nope. Not even a hunch.

                                     NORTON
                         I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've formed 
                         a very definite opinion. I think I 
                         know -- in fact I know I know what 
                         happened to Dietrichson.

                                     KEYES
                         You know you know what?

                                     NORTON
                         I know it was not an accident.

               He looks from Keyes to Neff and back to Keyes.

                                     NORTON
                         What do you say to that?

                                     KEYES
                         Me? You've got the ball. Let's see 
                         you run with it.

                                     NORTON
                         There's a widespread feeling that 
                         just because a man has a large office --

               The dictograph on his desk buzzes. He reaches over and 
               depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear.

                                     NORTON
                              (Into dictograph)
                         Yes?... Have her come in, please.

               He replaces the earpiece. He turns back to Keyes and Neff.

                                     NORTON
                         -- that just because a man has a 
                         large office he must be an idiot. 
                         I'm having a visitor, if you don't 
                         mind.

               Keyes and Neff start to get up.

                                     NORTON
                         No, no. I want you to stay and watch 
                         me handle this.

               The secretary has opened the door.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Dietrichson.

               Neff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious 
               effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored 
               suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries 
               a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. 
               Norton goes to meet her.

                                     NORTON
                         Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson. I assure you I appreciate 
                         it.

               He turns a little towards Keyes.

                                     NORTON
                         This is Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         How do you do.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         How do you do.

                                     NORTON
                         And Mr. Neff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.

               Norton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Norton goes behind 
               his desk.

                                     NORTON
                         Mrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of 
                         our sympathy in your bereavement. I 
                         hesitated before asking you to come 
                         here so soon after your loss.

               Phyllis nods silently.

                                     NORTON
                         But now that you're here I hope you 
                         won't mind if I plunge straight into 
                         business. You know why we asked you 
                         to come, don't you?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. All I know is that your secretary 
                         made it sound very urgent.

               Keyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed. He 
               has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the 
               armholes of his vest. He looks a little bored. Neff, behind 
               him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely 
               dead-pan.

                                     NORTON
                         Your husband had an accident policy 
                         with this company. Evidently you 
                         don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. I remember some talk at the house --

               She looks towards Neff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         -- but he didn't seem to want it.

                                     NEFF
                         He took it out a few days later, 
                         Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I see.

                                     NORTON
                         You'll probably find the policy among 
                         his personal effects.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         His safe deposit box hasn't been 
                         opened yet. It seems a tax examiner 
                         has to be present.

                                     NORTON
                         Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't 
                         want you to think you are being 
                         subjected to any questioning. But 
                         there are a few things we should 
                         like to know.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What sort of things?

                                     NORTON
                         We have the report of the coroner's 
                         inquest. Accidental death. We are 
                         not entirely satisfied. In fact we 
                         are not satisfied at all.

               Phyllis looks at him coolly.

               Keyes looks vaguely interested.

               Neff is staring straight at Phyllis.

                                     NORTON
                         Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect 
                         suicide.

               Phyllis doesn't bat an eyelash.

                                     NORTON
                         I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of 
                         water?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Please.

                                     NORTON
                         Mr. Neff.

               He indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff. Neff pours a 
               glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis. She has lifted 
               her veil a little. She takes the glass from his hand.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Thank you.

               Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second.

                                     NORTON
                         Had your husband been moody or 
                         depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson? 
                         Did he seem to have financial worries, 
                         for instance?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He was perfectly all right and I 
                         don't know of any financial worries.

                                     NORTON
                         There must have been something, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson. Let us examine this so-
                         called accident. First, your husband 
                         takes out this policy in absolute 
                         secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't 
                         want his family to suspect what he 
                         intends to do.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Do what?

                                     NORTON
                         Commit suicide. Next, he goes on 
                         this trip entirely alone. He has to 
                         be alone. He hobbles all the way out 
                         to the observation platform, very 
                         unlikely with his leg in a cast, 
                         unless he has a very strong reason. 
                         Once there, he finds he is not alone. 
                         There is a man there. What was his 
                         name, Keyes?

               Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't 
               even bother to look up.

                                     KEYES
                         His name was Jackson. Probably still 
                         is.

                                     NORTON
                         Jackson. So your husband gets rid of 
                         this Jackson with some flimsy excuse 
                         about cigars. And then he is alone. 
                         And then he does it. He jumps. 
                         Suicide. In which case the company 
                         is not liable.
                              (Pause)
                         You know that, of course. We could 
                         go to court --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I don't know anything. In fact I 
                         don't know why I came here.

               She makes as if to rise indignantly.

                                     NORTON
                         Just a moment, please. I said we 
                         could go to court. I didn't say we 
                         want to. Not only is it against our 
                         practice, but it would involve a 
                         great deal of expense, a lot of 
                         lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.

               Phyllis rises coldly.

                                     NORTON
                         So what I want to suggest is a 
                         compromise on both sides. A settlement 
                         for a certain sum, a part of the 
                         policy value --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I 
                         came in here I had no idea you owed 
                         me any money. You told me you did. 
                         Then you told me you didn't. Now you 
                         tell me you want to pay me a part of 
                         it, whatever it is. You want to 
                         bargain with me, at a time like this. 
                         I don't like your insinuations about 
                         my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't 
                         like your methods. In fact I don't 
                         like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, 
                         gentlemen.

               She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is 
               a pregnant pause. Keyes straightens up in his chair.

                                     KEYES
                         Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure 
                         carried that ball.

               Norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it.

                                     KEYES
                         Only you fumbled on the goal line. 
                         Then you heaved an illegal forward 
                         pass and got thrown for a forty-yard 
                         loss. Now you can't pick yourself up 
                         because you haven't got a leg to 
                         stand on.

                                     NORTON
                         I haven't eh? Let her claim. Let her 
                         sue. We can prove it was suicide.

               Keyes stands up.

                                     KEYES
                         Can we? Mr. Norton, the first thing 
                         that hit me was that suicide angle. 
                         Only I dropped it in the wastepaper 
                         basket just three seconds later. You 
                         ought to take a look at the statistics 
                         on suicide sometime. You might learn 
                         a little something about the insurance 
                         business.

                                     NORTON
                         I was raised in the insurance 
                         business, Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. In the front office. Come on, 
                         you never read an actuarial table in 
                         your life. I've got ten volumes on 
                         suicide alone. Suicide by race, by 
                         color, by occupation, by sex, by 
                         seasons of the year, by time of day. 
                         Suicide, how committed: by poisons, 
                         by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps. 
                         Suicide by poison, subdivided by 
                         types of poison, such as corrosive, 
                         irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, 
                         alkaloid, protein, and so forth. 
                         Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps 
                         from high places, under wheels of 
                         trains, under wheels of trucks, under 
                         the feet of horses, from steamboats. 
                         But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on 
                         record there's not one single case 
                         of suicide by leap from the rear end 
                         of a moving train. And do you know 
                         how fast that train was going at the 
                         point where the body was found? 
                         Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could 
                         anybody jump off a slow moving train 
                         like that with any kind of expectation 
                         that he would kill himself? No soap, 
                         Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're 
                         going to pay through the nose, and 
                         you know it. May I have this?

               Keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the 
               glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big 
               gulp.

               Norton is watching him almost stupefied. Neff stands with 
               the shadow of a smile on his face. Keyes puts the glass down 
               noisily on Norton's desk.

                                     KEYES
                         Come on, Walter.

               Norton doesn't move or speak. Keyes puts his hat on and 
               crosses towards the door, Neff after him. With the doorknob 
               in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at 
               his own shirt sleeves.

                                     KEYES
                         Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

               They go out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               C-5 NEFF - AT DICTAPHONE - (NIGHT)

               There is a tired grin on his face as he talks into the horn.

                                     NEFF
                         I could have hugged you right then 
                         and there, Keyes, you and your 
                         statistics. You were the only one we 
                         were really scared of, and instead 
                         you were almost playing on our team...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               C-6 NEFF'S APARTMENT - EVENING - ALMOST DARK IN THE ROOM

               The corridor door opens letting light in. Neff enters with 
               his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the 
               lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the 
               door, puts the key in his pocket. At this moment the telephone 
               rings. He picks up the phone.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         That evening when I got home my nerves 
                         had eased off. I could feel the ground 
                         under my feet again, and it looked 
                         like easy going from there on it.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello... Hello, baby.... Sure, 
                         everything is fine... You were 
                         wonderful in Norton's office.

               C-7 INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH IN A DRUG STORE

               Phyllis is on the phone. She is not dressed as in Norton's 
               office.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I felt so funny. I wanted to look at 
                         you all the time.

               C-8 NEFF ON TELEPHONE IN HIS APARTMENT

                                     NEFF
                         How do you think I felt? Where are 
                         you, baby?

               C-9 PHYLLIS ON PHONE

                                     PHYLLIS
                         At the drug store. Just a block away. 
                         Can I come up?

               C-10 NEFF'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT) - NEFF ON PHONE

                                     NEFF
                         Okay. But be careful. Don't let 
                         anybody see you.

               He hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase 
               on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to 
               lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers 
               up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor 
               and puts it in the waste-paper basket.

               The door bell rings.

               Neff stops in sudden alarm. It can't be Phyllis. The time is 
               too short. For a second he stands there motionless, then 
               crosses to the door and opens it.

               In the open door stands Keyes.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

               Keyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped 
               behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in 
               his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off 
               Keyes.

                                     NEFF
                         What's on your mind?

               Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns.

                                     KEYES
                         That broken leg. The guy broke his 
                         leg.

                                     NEFF
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KEYES
                         Talking about Dietrichson. He had 
                         accident insurance, didn't he? Then 
                         he broke his leg, didn't he?

                                     NEFF
                         So what?

                                     KEYES
                         And he didn't put in a claim. Why 
                         didn't he put in a claim? Why?

                                     NEFF
                         What the dickens are you driving at?

                                     KEYES
                         Walter. There's something wrong. I 
                         ate dinner two hours ago. It stuck 
                         half way.

               He prods his stomach with his thumb.

                                     KEYES
                         The little man is acting up again. 
                         Because there's something wrong with 
                         that Dietrichson case.

                                     NEFF
                         Because he didn't put in a claim? 
                         Maybe he just didn't have time.

                                     KEYES
                         Oh maybe he just didn't know he was 
                         insured.

               He has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for 
               a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes.

               Keyes shakes his head suddenly.

                                     KEYES
                         No. That couldn't be it. You delivered 
                         the policy to him personally, didn't 
                         you, Walter? And you got his check.

                                     NEFF
                              (Stiff-lipped, but 
                              his voice is as well 
                              under control as he 
                              can manage)
                         Sure, I did.

               Keyes prods his stomach again.

                                     KEYES
                         Got any bicarbonate of soda?

                                     NEFF
                         No I haven't.

               Keyes resumes his pacing.

                                     KEYES
                         Listen, Walter. I've been living 
                         with this little man for twenty-six 
                         years. He's never failed me yet. 
                         There's got to be something wrong.

                                     NEFF
                         Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was 
                         suicide, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         No. Not suicide.
                              (Pause)
                         But not accident either.

                                     NEFF
                         What else?

               There is another longer pause, agonizing for Neff. Finally 
               Keyes continues:

                                     KEYES
                         Look. A man takes out an accident 
                         policy that is worth a hundred 
                         thousand dollars if he is killed on 
                         a train. Then, two weeks later, he 
                         is killed on a train. And not in a 
                         train accident, mind you, but falling 
                         off some silly observation car. Do 
                         you know what the mathematical 
                         probability of that is, Walter? One 
                         out of I don't know how many billions. 
                         And add to that the broken leg. It 
                         just can't be the way it looks, 
                         Walter. Something has been worked on 
                         us.

                                     NEFF
                         Such as what?

               Keyes doesn't answer. He goes on pacing up and down. Finally 
               Neff can't stand the silence any longer.

                                     NEFF
                         Murder?

                                     KEYES
                              (Prods stomach again)
                         Don't you have any peppermint or 
                         anything?

                                     NEFF
                         I'm sorry.
                              (Pause)
                         Who do you suspect?

                                     KEYES
                         Maybe I like to make things easy for 
                         myself. But I always tend to suspect 
                         the beneficiary.

                                     NEFF
                         The wife?

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. That wide-eyed dame that didn't 
                         know anything about anything.

                                     NEFF
                         You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even 
                         on the train.

                                     KEYES
                         I know she wasn't, Walter. I don't 
                         claim to know how it was worked, or 
                         who worked it, but I know that it 
                         was worked.

               He crosses to the corridor door.

                                     KEYES
                         I've got to get to a drug store. It 
                         feels like a hunk of concrete inside 
                         me.

               He puts his hand on the knob to open the door.

               C-11 CORRIDOR - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT - LIGHTS ON

               The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been standing 
               close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door 
               has just started to open. Phyllis moves away quickly and 
               flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. 
               Keyes is coming out.

                                     KEYES
                         Good night, Walter.

               Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for 
               Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through 
               the crack of the partly opened door. He pushes the door wide 
               so as to hide her from Keyes.

                                     NEFF
                         Good night, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         See you at the office in the morning.

               He has reached the elevator. He pushes the call button and 
               turns.

                                     KEYES
                         But I'd like to move in on her right 
                         now, tonight, if it wasn't for Norton 
                         and his stripe-pants ideas about 
                         company policy. I'd have the cops 
                         after her so quick her head would 
                         spin. They'd put her through the 
                         wringer, and, brother, what they 
                         would squeeze out.

                                     NEFF
                         Only you haven't got a single thing 
                         to go on, Keyes.

               The elevator has come up and stopped.

                                     KEYES
                         Not too much. Twenty-six years 
                         experience, all the percentage there 
                         is, and this lump of concrete in my 
                         stomach.

               He pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one 
               last glance of annoyance.

                                     KEYES
                              (Almost angrily)
                         No bicarbonate of soda.

               Keyes gets into the elevator. The door closes. The elevator 
               goes down.

               Neff stands numb, looking at the spot where Keyes was last 
               visible. Without moving his eyes he pulls the door around 
               towards him with his left hand. Phyllis slowly comes out.

               Neff motions quickly to her to go into the apartment. She 
               crosses in front of him and enters. He steps in backwards 
               after her.

               C-12 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT

               Phyllis has come a few steps into the room. Neff, backing in 
               after her, closes the door from inside and turns slowly. 
               They look at each other for a long moment in complete silence.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         How much does he know?

                                     NEFF
                         It's not what he knows. It's those 
                         stinking hunches of his.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But he can't prove anything, can he?

                                     NEFF
                         Not if we're careful. Not if we don't 
                         see each other for a while.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         For how long a while?

               She moves toward him but he does not respond.

                                     NEFF
                         Until all this dies down. You don't 
                         know Keyes the way I do. Once he 
                         gets his teeth into something he 
                         won't let go. He'll investigate you. 
                         He'll have you shadowed. He'll watch 
                         you every minute from now on. Are 
                         you afraid, baby?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, I'm afraid. But not of Keyes. 
                         I'm afraid of us. We're not the same 
                         any more. We did it so we could be 
                         together, but instead of that it's 
                         pulling us apart. Isn't it, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         What are you talking about?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And you don't really care whether we 
                         see each other or not.

                                     NEFF
                         Shut up, baby.

               He pulls her close and kisses her.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               D-1 INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - ANTEROOM - (DAY)

               Two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work. 
               Several visitors are waiting in chairs. Lola Dietrichson is 
               one of them. She's wearing a simple black suit and hat, 
               indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a 
               handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors 
               anxiously.

               (Now and then the telephone operators in the background are 
               heard saying, "PACIFIC ALL-RISK. GOOD AFTERNOON.")

               The elevator comes up and the doors open. Several people 
               come out, among them Neff, carrying his briefcase. Lola sees 
               him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the 
               anteroom without recognizing her she stops him.

                                     LOLA
                         Hello, Mr. Neff.

               Neff looks at her a little startled.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello.

               His voice hangs in the air.

                                     LOLA
                         Lola Dietrichson. Don't you remember 
                         me?

                                     NEFF
                              (On his guard)
                         Yes. Of course.

                                     LOLA
                         Could I talk to you, just for a few 
                         minutes? Somewhere where we can be 
                         alone?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. Come on into my office.

               He pushes the swing door open and holds it for her. As she 
               passes in front of him his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation.

               D-2 TWELFTH FLOOR - BALCONY

               Neff comes up level with Lola and leads her towards his 
               office, CAMERA WITH THEM.

                                     NEFF
                         Is it something to do with -- what 
                         happened?

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, Mr. Neff. It's about my father's 
                         death.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.

               He opens the door of his office and holds it for her. She 
               enters.

               D-3 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (DAY)

               Lou Schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his 
               desk. Lola enters, Neff after her.

                                     NEFF
                              (To Schwartz)
                         Lou, do you mind if I use the office 
                         alone for a few minutes?

                                     SCHWARTZ
                         It's all yours, Walter.

               He gets up and goes out. Lola has walked over to the window 
               and is looking out so Schwartz won't stare at her. Neff places 
               a chair beside his desk.

                                     NEFF
                         Won't you sit down?

               At the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks with a 
               catch in her voice.

                                     LOLA
                         Mr. Neff, I can't help it, but I 
                         have such a strange feeling that 
                         there is something queer about my 
                         father's death.

                                     NEFF
                         Queer? Queer in what way?

                                     LOLA
                         I don't know why I should be bothering 
                         you with my troubles, except that 
                         you knew my father and knew about 
                         the insurance he took out. And you 
                         were so nice to me that evening in 
                         your car.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. We got along fine, didn't we.

               He sits down. His face is grim and watchful.

                                     LOLA
                         Look at me, Mr. Neff. I'm not crazy. 
                         I'm not hysterical. I'm not even 
                         crying. But I have the awful feeling 
                         that something is wrong, and I had 
                         the same feeling once before -- when 
                         my mother died.

                         When your mother died?

                                     LOLA
                         We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That 
                         was six years ago. We had a cabin 
                         there. It was winter and very cold 
                         and my mother was very sick with 
                         pneumonia. She had a nurse with her. 
                         There were just the three of us in 
                         the cabin. One night I got up and 
                         went into my mother's room. She was 
                         delirious with fever. All the bed 
                         covers were on the floor and the 
                         windows were wide open. The nurse 
                         wasn't in the room. I ran and covered 
                         my mother up as quickly as I could. 
                         Just then I heard a door open behind 
                         me. The nurse stood there. She didn't 
                         say a word, but there was a look in 
                         her eyes I'll never forget. Two days 
                         later my mother was dead.
                              (Pause)
                         Do you know who that nurse was?

               Neff stares at her tensely. He knows only too well who the 
               nurse was.

                                     NEFF
                         No. Who?

                                     LOLA
                         Phyllis. I tried to tell my father, 
                         but I was just a kid then and he 
                         wouldn't listen to me. Six months 
                         later she married him and I kind of 
                         talked myself out of the idea that 
                         she could have done anything like 
                         that. But now it's all back again, 
                         now that something has happened to 
                         my father, too.

                                     NEFF
                         You're not making sense, Miss 
                         Dietrichson. Your father fell off a 
                         train.

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, and two days before he fell off 
                         that train what was Phyllis doing? 
                         She was in her room in front of a 
                         mirror, with a black hat on, and she 
                         was pinning a black veil to it, as 
                         if she couldn't wait to see how she 
                         would look in mourning.

                                     NEFF
                         Look. You've had a pretty bad shock. 
                         Aren't you just imagining all this?

                                     LOLA
                         I caught her eyes in the mirror, and 
                         they had that look in them they had 
                         before my mother died. That same 
                         look.

                                     NEFF
                         You don't like your step-mother, do 
                         you? Isn't it just because she is 
                         your step-mother?

                                     LOLA
                         I loathe her. Because she did it. 
                         She did it for the money. Only you're 
                         not going to pay her, are you, Mr. 
                         Neff? She's not going to get away 
                         with it this time. I'm going to speak 
                         up. I'm going to tell everything I 
                         know.

                                     NEFF
                         You'd better be careful, saying things 
                         like that.

                                     LOLA
                         I'm not afraid. You'll see.

               She turns again to the window so he won't see that she is 
               crying. Neff gets up and goes to her.

                                     LOLA
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act like 
                         this.

                         Of course not. I'm not living in the 
                         house any more. I moved out.

                         And you didn't tell that boy-friend 
                         of yours? Zachetti.

                         I'm not seeing him any more. We had

               She turns from the window with a pathetic little nod.

                         Street where nobody would see us. I

               Neff and Lola driving along the beach near Santa Monica. 
               Neff is wearing a light summer suit, very much in contrast 
               to Lola's mourning. Apparently she is telling him a story 
               and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound.

               CAMERA MOVES PAST HER TO A: CLOSE SHOT OF NEFF behind the 
               steering wheel. He is only half listening to Lola. His mind 
               is full of other thoughts.

                         Next day was Sunday and we went for 
                         a ride down to the beach. She had 
                         loosened up a bit and she was even 
                         laughing... I had to make sure she 
                         wouldn't tell that stuff about Phyllis 
                         to anybody else. It was dynamite, 
                         whether it was true or not. And I 
                         had no chance to talk to Phyllis. 
                         You were watching her like a hawk, 
                         Keyes. I couldn't even phone her for 
                         fear you had the wires tapped.

               D-6 INSURANCE OFFICE - 12TH FLOOR - DAY

               Neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is walking toward 
               Keyes' office. As he comes up close to the door, he stops 
               with a startled expression on his face. On a chair beside 
               the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from 
               the observation platform of the train. He is wearing his 
               Stetson hat and smoking a cigar. He is studying something in 
               the file folder. Neff recognizes him immediately but Jackson 
               does not look up. Neff controls his expression and goes on 
               to open the door to Keyes' office.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Monday morning there was a note on 
                         my desk that you wanted to see me, 
                         Keyes. For a minute I wondered if it 
                         could be about Lola. It was worse. 
                         Outside your door was the last guy 
                         in the world I wanted to see.

               D-7 INT. KEYES' OFFICE

               Neff is just closing the door from the inside. Keyes, his 
               coat off, is lying on his office couch, chewing on a cigar, 
               as usual.

                                     KEYES
                         Come in. Come in, Walter. I want to 
                         ask you something. After all the 
                         years we've known each other, do you 
                         mind if I make a rather blunt 
                         statement?

                                     NEFF

                         About me. Walter, I'm a very great 
                         man. This Dietrichson business. It's 
                         murder, and murders don't come any 
                         neater. As fancy a piece of homicide 
                         as anybody ever ran into. Smart and 
                         tricky and almost perfect, but --

               Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball.

                                     KEYES
                         but, I think Papa has it all figured 
                         out, figured out and wrapped up in 
                         tissue paper with pink ribbons on

                         You know what? That guy Dietrichson 
                         was never on the train.

                                     NEFF
                         He wasn't?

                                     KEYES
                         No, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you 
                         can't be sure of killing a man by 
                         throwing him off a train that's going 
                         fifteen miles an hour. The only way 
                         you can be sure is to kill him first 
                         and then throw his body on the tracks. 
                         That would mean either killing him 
                         on the train, or -- and this is where 
                         it really gets fancy -- you kill him 
                         somewhere else and put him on the 
                         tracks. Two possibilities, and I 
                         personally buy the second.

                                     NEFF
                         You're way ahead of me, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Look, it was like this. They killed 
                         the guy -- the wife and somebody 
                         else -- and then the somebody else 
                         took the crutches and went on the 
                         train as Dietrichson, and then the 
                         somebody else jumped off, and then 
                         they put the body on the tracks where 
                         the train had passed. An 
                         impersonation, see. And a cinch to 
                         work. Because it was night, very few 
                         people were about, they had the 
                         crutches to stare at, and they never 
                         really looked at the man at all.

                                     NEFF
                         It's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe 
                         it's a little too fancy.

                                     KEYES
                         Is it? I tell you it fits together 
                         like a watch. And now let's see what 
                         we have in the way of proof. The 
                         only guy that really got a good look 
                         at this supposed Dietrichson is 
                         sitting right outside my office. I 
                         took the trouble to bring him down 
                         here from Oregon. Let's see what he 
                         has to say.

               Keyes goes to the door and opens it.

                                     KEYES
                         Come in, Mr. Jackson.

               Jackson enters with the file folder.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes sir, Mr. Keyes. These are fine 
                         cigars you smoke.

               He indicates the cigar he himself is smoking.

                                     KEYES
                         Two for a quarter.

                                     JACKSON
                         That's what I said.

                                     KEYES
                         Never mind the cigar, Jackson. Did 
                         you study those photographs? What do 
                         you say?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, indeed, I studied them 
                         thoroughly. Very thoroughly

                                     KEYES
                         Well? Did you make up your mind?

                                     JACKSON
                         Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, 
                         Oregon. Up in Medford we take our 
                         time making up our minds --

                                     KEYES
                         Well you're not in Medford now. I'm 
                         in a hurry. Let's have it.

               Jackson indicates the file folder he is holding.

                                     JACKSON
                         Are these photographs of the late 
                         Mr. Dietrichson?

                                     KEYES
                         Yes.

                                     JACKSON
                         Then my answer is no.

                                     KEYES
                         What do you mean no?

                                     JACKSON
                         I mean this is not the man that was 
                         on the train.

                                     KEYES
                         Will you swear to that?

                                     JACKSON
                         I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon. 
                         And if I say it, I mean it, and if I 
                         mean it, of course I'll swear it.

                                     KEYES
                         Thank you.

               Keyes turns to Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         There you are, Walter. There's your 
                         proof.

               Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson.

                                     KEYES
                         Oh, Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Neff, 
                         one of our salesmen.

                                     JACKSON
                         Please to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased 
                         indeed.

                                     NEFF
                         How do you do.

                                     JACKSON
                         Very fine, thank you. Never was 
                         better.

                                     KEYES
                         Mr. Jackson, how would you describe 
                         the man you saw on that observation 
                         platform?

                                     JACKSON
                         Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger 
                         man, about ten or fifteen years 
                         younger than the man in these 
                         photographs.

                                     KEYES
                         Dietrichson was about fifty, wasn't 
                         he, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Fifty-one, according to the policy.

                                     JACKSON
                         The man I saw was nothing like fifty-
                         one years old. Of course, it was 
                         pretty dark on that platform and, 
                         come to think of it, he tried to 
                         keep his back towards me. But I'm 
                         positive just the same.

                                     KEYES
                         That's fine, Jackson. Now you 
                         understand this matter is strictly 
                         confidential. We may need you again 
                         down here in Los Angeles, if the 
                         case comes to court.

                                     JACKSON
                         Any time you need me, I'm at your 
                         entire disposal, gentlemen. Expenses 
                         paid, of course.

               Keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it.

                                     KEYES
                         Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.

               Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff and, during the 
               ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low 
               voice on the phone in background. We do not hear what he 
               says.

                                     JACKSON
                              (To Neff)
                         Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff?

                                     NEFF
                         Never.

                                     JACKSON
                         Wait a minute. Do you go trout 
                         fishing? Maybe I saw you up Klamath 
                         Falls way.

                                     NEFF
                         Nope. Never fish.

                                     JACKSON
                         Neff. Neff. I've got it! It's the 
                         name. There's a family of Neffs in 
                         Corvallis.

                                     NEFF
                         No relation.

                                     JACKSON
                         Let me see. This man's an automobile 
                         dealer in Corvallis. Very reputable 
                         man, too, I'm told.

               Keyes rejoins them at this point.

                                     KEYES
                         All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you 
                         go down to the cashier's office -- 
                         room twenty-seven on the eleventh 
                         floor. They'll take care of your 
                         expense account and your ticket for 
                         the train tonight.

                                     JACKSON
                         Tonight? Tomorrow morning would suit 
                         me better. There's a very good 
                         osteopath down here I want to see 
                         before I leave.

               Keyes has opened the door for Jackson.

                                     KEYES
                         Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put 
                         her on the expense account.

               Jackson doesn't get it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure.

               He goes out.

                                     KEYES
                         There it is, Walter. It's beginning 
                         to come apart at the seams already. 
                         A murder's never perfect. It always 
                         comes apart sooner or later. And 
                         when two people are involved it's 
                         usually sooner. We know the 
                         Dietrichson dame is in it, and 
                         somebody else. Pretty soon we're 
                         going to know who that somebody else 
                         is. He'll show. He's got to show. 
                         Sometime, somewhere, they've got to 
                         meet. Their emotions are all kicked 
                         up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't 
                         matter. They can't keep away from 
                         each other. They think it's twice as 
                         safe because there are two of them. 
                         But it's not twice as safe. It's ten 
                         times twice as dangerous. They've 
                         committed a murder and that's not 
                         like taking a trolley ride together 
                         where each one can get off at a 
                         different stop. They're stuck with 
                         each other. They've got to ride all 
                         the way to the end of the line. And 
                         it's a one-way trip, and the last 
                         stop is the cemetery.

               He puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets 
               for matches.

                                     KEYES
                              (Continued)
                         She put in her claim and I'm going 
                         to throw it right back at her.
                              (Pats his pockets 
                              again)
                         Have you got one of those?

               Neff strikes a match for him. Keyes takes the match out of 
               his hand and lights his cigar.

                                     KEYES
                         Let her sue us if she dares. I'll be 
                         ready for her -- and that somebody

                         graves.

               D-8 TELEPHONE BOOTH IN JERRY'S MARKET - DAY

               Neff is in the booth dialing a number, and as she waits he 
               looks around to make sure he is not watched.

                                     NEFF
                              (Into phone)
                         Mrs. Dietrichson?... This is Jerry's 
                         market. We just got in a shipment of 
                         that English soap you were asking 
                         about. Will you be coming by this 
                         morning?... Thank you, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson.

               Neff hangs up.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-9 EXT. JERRY'S MARKET - DAY

               The LaSalle stops in front of the market. Phyllis steps out 
               and goes into the market, looking around.

               D-10 SHELVES IN THE REAR OF MARKET

               Neff is moving slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but 
               with his nerves on edge. From beyond him Phyllis approaches. 
               She stops beside him, facing the same way, with a couple of 
               feet separating them.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Hello, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                              (In a harsh whisper)
                         Come closer.

               Phyllis moves close to him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's the matter?

                                     NEFF
                         Everything's the matter. Keyes is 
                         rejecting your claim. He's sitting 
                         back with his mouth watering, waiting 
                         for you to sue. He wants you to sue. 
                         But you're not going to.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's he got to stop me?

                                     NEFF
                         He's got the goods. He's figured out 
                         how it was worked. He knows it was 
                         somebody else on the train. He's dug 
                         up a witness he thinks will prove 
                         it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Prove it how? Listen, if he rejects 
                         that claim, I have to sue.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah? And then you're in court and a 
                         lot of other things are going to 
                         come up. Like, for instance, about 
                         you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

               Phyllis looks at him sharply, sideways.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What about me and the first Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson?

                                     NEFF
                         The way she died. And about that 
                         black hat you were trying on -- before 
                         you needed a black hat.

               A customer comes along the aisle toward them. They move apart. 
               The customer passes. Phyllis draws close again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, Lola's been telling you some 
                         of her cockeyed stories. She's been 
                         seeing you.

                                     NEFF
                         I've been seeing her, if you want to 
                         know. So she won't yell her head off 
                         about what she knows.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, she's been putting on an act 
                         for you, crying all over your 
                         shoulder, that lying little --

                                     NEFF
                         Keep her out of it. All I'm telling 
                         you is we're not going to sue.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Because you don't want the money any 
                         more, even if you could get it? 
                         Because she's made you feel like a 
                         heel all of sudden.

                                     NEFF
                         It isn't the money any more. It's 
                         our necks now. We're pulling out, 
                         understand.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Because of what Keyes can do? You're 
                         not fooling me, Walter. It's because 
                         of Lola. What you did to her father. 
                         You can't take it that she might 
                         find out some day.

                                     NEFF
                         I said, leave her out of it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, it's me I'm talking about. I 
                         don't want to be left out of it.

                                     NEFF
                         Stop saying that. It's just that it 
                         hasn't worked out the way we wanted. 
                         We can't have the money. We can't go 
                         through with it, that's all.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         We have gone through with it, Walter. 
                         The tough part is all behind us. We 
                         just have to hold on now and not go 
                         soft inside, and stick together, 
                         close, the way we started out.

               Phyllis takes his arm, forgetting where she is. He pulls 
               away.

                                     NEFF
                         Watch it, will you. Someone's coming.

               One of the market help, pushing a small hand-truck loaded 
               with packaged goods, comes along the aisle. He stops and 
               begins to restock a shelf very close to Neff and Phyllis. 
               They go off slowly in opposite directions. CAMERA PANS with 
               Neff as he walks toward another shelf, one that stands away 
               from the wall. Phyllis appears on the opposite side of the 
               shelf and stops, facing toward him. They now continue their 
               low-voiced dialogue through the piled-up merchandise.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I loved you, Walter. And I hated 
                         him. But I wasn't going to do anything 
                         about it, not until I met you. It 
                         was you had the plan. I only wanted 
                         him dead.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah, and I was the one that fixed 
                         him so he was dead. Is that what 
                         you're telling me?

               Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and 
               looks at him with cold, hard eyes.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. And nobody's pulling out. We 
                         went into it together, and we're 
                         coming out at the end together. It's 
                         straight down the line for both of 
                         us, remember.

               Phyllis puts the glasses on again and goes.

               Over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the COMMENTARY.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Yeah. I remembered all right. Just 
                         as I remembered what you had told 
                         me, Keyes, about that trolley car 
                         ride and how there was no way to get 
                         off -- until the end of the line.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               Neff is dictating into the dictaphone.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah, I remembered it all right. 
                         Just as I remembered what you had 
                         told me, Keyes, about that trolley 
                         car ride, and how there was no way 
                         to get off until the end of the line, 
                         where the cemetery was. And I got to 
                         thinking what cemeteries are for. 
                         They're to put dead people in, I 
                         guess that was the first time I ever 
                         thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, 
                         I mean, and how things would be if 
                         she was dead. Because the way it was 
                         now she had me by the throat. She 
                         could hang me higher than a kite any 
                         day she felt like it. And there was 
                         nothing I could do, except hold my 
                         breath and watch that day come closer 
                         and closer, and maybe pray a little, 
                         if I still knew how to pray... I saw 
                         Lola three or four times that week. 
                         I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, after 
                         what I had done, but it was only 
                         with her that I could relax and let 
                         go a little. Then one night we drove 
                         up into the hills above Hollywood 
                         Bowl...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-12 HOLLYWOOD HILLS (NIGHT) (TRANSPARENCY)

               Neff and Lola are climbing over a low hill in the foreground. 
               The sky is starlit and music from the Bowl comes over the 
               scene from below (Cesar Franck D Minor Symphony). As he helps 
               her climb up, CAMERA PANS with them and shows the expanse of 
               the Bowl below, a packed audience, and the orchestra on the 
               lighted shell.

               They sit down on the grass. Neff sits near her, not too close. 
               It is very dark and they are silhouetted against the shell 
               lights. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a 
               match. The flame lights up Lola's face. Neff glances at her. 
               She is crying. He lights his cigarette and blows out the 
               match. A pause follows.

                                     NEFF
                         Why are you crying?

               Lola doesn't answer.

                                     NEFF
                         You won't tell me?

                                     LOLA
                              (In a choked voice)
                         Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't 
                         tell anybody else but you. It's about 
                         Nino.

                                     NEFF
                         Zachetti? What about him?

                                     LOLA
                         They killed my father together. He 
                         and Phyllis. He helped her do it. I 
                         know he did.

                                     NEFF
                         What makes you say that?

                                     LOLA
                         I've been following him. He's at her 
                         house, night after night. It was 
                         Phyllis and him all the time. Maybe 
                         he was going with me just for a blind. 
                         And the night of the murder --

                                     NEFF
                         You promised not to talk that way 
                         any more.

                                     LOLA
                         -- he was supposed to pick me up 
                         after a lecture at U.C.L.A. -- but 
                         he never showed up. He said he was 
                         sick. Sick! He couldn't show up, 
                         because the train was leaving with 
                         my father on it.

               She begins to cry again.

                                     LOLA
                         Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all 
                         just in my mind.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, it's all in your mind.

                                     LOLA
                         I only wish it was, Walter, because 
                         I still love him.

               Over Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the 
               commentary.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-13 LOBBY OF PACIFIC BLDG. (DAY)

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Zachetti. That's funny. Phyllis and 
                         Zachetti. What was he doing up at 
                         her house? I couldn't figure that 
                         one out I tried to make sense out of 
                         it and got nowhere. But the real 
                         brain-twister came the next day. You 
                         sprang it on me, Keyes, after office 
                         hours, when you caught me down in 
                         the lobby of the building.

               About 5:00 P.M. or a little later. A stream of office 
               employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator 
               reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, 
               among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase.

               CAMERA PRECEDES HIM as he walks toward the entrance doors. 
               He is stopped by Keyes' voice, off to one side.

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                         Oh, Walter, just a minute.

               Neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves 
               towards him. Keyes is standing there buying cigars. He is 
               stuffing them into his pockets.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Hang onto your hat, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         What for?

                                     KEYES
                         Nothing much. The Dietrichson case 
                         just busted wide open.

                                     NEFF
                         How do you mean?

                                     KEYES
                         The guy showed. That's how.

                                     NEFF
                         The somebody else?

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. The guy that did it with her.

                                     NEFF
                         No kidding?

                                     KEYES
                         She's filed suit against us, and 
                         it's okay by me. When we get into 
                         that courtroom I'll tear them apart, 
                         both of them. Come on -- I'll buy 
                         you a martini.

                                     NEFF
                         No thanks, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         With two olives.

                                     NEFF
                         I've got to get a shave and a 
                         shoeshine. I've got a date.

                                     KEYES
                         Margie. I still bet she drinks from 
                         the bottle.

               He bites off the end of the cigar and puts the cigar into 
               his mouth. He starts tapping his pockets for a match, as 
               usual. Neff strikes a match for him.

                                     NEFF
                         They give you matches when they sell 
                         you cigars, Keyes. All you have to 
                         do is ask for them.

                                     KEYES
                         I don't like them. They always explode 
                         in my pockets. So long, Walter.

               Keyes goes toward the street and OUT OF SCENE. Neff moves 
               back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the 
               elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes 
               is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         You sure had me worried, Keyes. I 
                         didn't know if you were playing cat-
                         and-mouse with me, whether you knew 
                         all along I was the somebody else. 
                         That's what I had to find out, and I 
                         thought I knew where to look...

                                     NEFF

                         Twelve.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-14 ENTRANCE - OFFICE. 12TH FLOOR RECEPTION ROOM (DAY)

               Neff comes out of the elevator. The receptionist is just 
               tidying up her desk. She has her hat on and is preparing to 
               leave. Neff passes on through the swinging doors to the 
               twelfth floor balcony.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Upstairs, the last of the people 
                         were just leaving.

               D-15 12TH FLOOR BALCONY

               Neff enters from the reception room. A couple of belated 
               employees are leaving for the day. Neff goes toward Keyes' 
               office, looks around to make sure he is unobserved, enters.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         I made sure nobody saw me go into 
                         your office.

               D-16 KEYES' OFFICE (DAY)

               Neff has just come in. He goes over to Keyes' desk and 
               searches the papers on it. He tries the desk drawers and 
               finds them locked. His eye falls on the dictaphone on the 
               stand beside the desk. A record is on it, the needle is about 
               two-thirds of the way towards the end. He lifts the needle 
               and sets it back to the beginning of the record, sets the 
               switch to playback position. He lifts the arm off the bracket 
               and starts the machine. Keyes' voice is heard coming from 
               the horn:

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                              (From Dictaphone)
                         Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential. 
                         Dietrichson File. With regard to 
                         your proposal to put Walter Neff 
                         under surveillance, I disagree 
                         absolutely. I have investigated his 
                         movements on the night of the crime, 
                         and he is definitely placed in his 
                         apartment from 7:15 P.M. on. In 
                         addition to this, I have known Neff 
                         intimately for eleven years, and I 
                         personally vouch for him, without 
                         reservation...

               Neff stops the machine. He sits down slowly, still holding 
               the horn. He is deeply moved. After a moment, he presses the 
               switch again.

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                              (From Dictaphone)
                         ...Furthermore, no connection 
                         whatsoever has been established 
                         between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis 
                         Dietrichson, whereas I am now able 
                         to report that such a connection has 
                         been established between her and 
                         another man. This man has been 
                         observed to visit the Dietrichson 
                         home on the night of July 9th, 10th, 
                         11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded 
                         in identifying him as one Nino 
                         Zachetti, former medical student, 
                         aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac 
                         Court Apartments 1228½ N. La Brea 
                         Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's 
                         movements on the night of the crime 
                         and have found that they cannot be 
                         accounted for. I am preparing a more 
                         detailed report for your consideration 
                         and it is my belief that we already 
                         have sufficient evidence against 
                         Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to 
                         justify police action. I strongly 
                         urge that this whole matter be turned 
                         over to the office of the District 
                         Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes.

               Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on 
               revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the 
               needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace 
               the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops. 
               Neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and 
               goes out.

               D-17 12TH FLOOR, BALCONY

               Neff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly 
               back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there 
               looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have 
               now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, 
               then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of 
               a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office 
               and enters.

               D-18 NEFF'S OFFICE (DAY)

               Neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone and dials 
               a number. (During the ensuing telephone conversation, only 
               what he says is heard. The pauses indicate speeches at the 
               other end of the line).

                                     NEFF
                         Phyllis? Walter. I've got to see 
                         you... Tonight... Yes, it has to be 
                         tonight... How's eleven o'clock? 
                         Don't worry about Keyes. He's 
                         satisfied... Leave the door on the 
                         latch and put the lights out. No, 
                         nobody's watching the house... I 
                         told you Keyes is satisfied. It's 
                         just for the neighbors... That's 
                         what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock. 
                         Goodbye, baby.

               Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim 
               expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out and wipes 
               perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. 
               The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to 
               wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         I guess I don't have to tell you 
                         what I was going to do at eleven 
                         o'clock, Keyes. For the first time I 
                         saw a way to get clear of the whole 
                         mess I was in, and of Phyllis, too, 
                         all at the same time. Yeah, that's 
                         what I thought. But what I didn't 
                         know was that she was all set for 
                         me. That she had outsmarted me again, 
                         just like she always had...

               D-19 HALL STAIRWAY OF DIETRICHSON HOME (NIGHT)

               The lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs. 
               She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying 
               something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right 
               hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes 
               the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She 
               switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves 
               towards the living room, where there is still light on.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         She was all set and waiting for me. 
                         It could have been something in my 
                         voice when I called her up that tipped 
                         her off. And it could have been that 
                         she had the idea already. And an 
                         idea wasn't the only thing she had 
                         waiting for me.

               D-20 LIVING ROOM

               On the long table behind the davenport, one of the lamps is 
               lit. The only other light in the room is a standing lamp 
               beside the desk. A window toward the back is open, and through 
               it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC, probably a neighboring radio.

               Phyllis enters and crosses to the table. She puts out the 
               lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there. 
               The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the 
               windows.

               Phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she 
               sat in the first time Neff came to the house). She lifts the 
               loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. As 
               she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something 
               metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion 
               again.

               She turns to the low table in front of the davenport and 
               takes a cigarette from the box. She takes a match and is 
               about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming 
               up the hill. She listens, motionless. The car stops. A car 
               door is slammed.

               Calmly, Phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette. 
               She drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the 
               chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. There are 
               footsteps outside the house.

               Over the chair in which Phyllis is sitting, the hallway is 
               visible through the arch. The front door opens. Neff comes 
               in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands 
               there. He closes the door again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (In foreground)
                         In here, Walter.

               Neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, baby. Anybody else in the 
                         house?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Nobody. Why?

                                     NEFF
                         What's that music?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         A radio up the street.

               Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her.

                                     NEFF
                         Just like the first time I was here. 
                         We were talking about automobile 
                         insurance. Only you were thinking 
                         about murder. And I was thinking 
                         about that anklet.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And what are you thinking about now?

                                     NEFF
                         I'm all through thinking. This is 
                         goodbye.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Goodbye? Where are you going?

                                     NEFF
                         It's you that's going, baby. Not me. 
                         I'm getting off the trolley car right 
                         at this corner.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's 
                         have it, whatever it is.

                                     NEFF
                         I have a friend who's got a funny 
                         theory. He says when two people commit 
                         a murder they're kind of on a trolley 
                         car, and one can't get off without 
                         the other. They're stuck with each 
                         other. They have to go on riding 
                         clear to the end of the line. And 
                         the last stop is the cemetery.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe he's got something there.

                                     NEFF
                         You bet he has, Two people are going 
                         to ride to the end of the line, all 
                         right. Only I'm not going to be one 
                         of them. I've got another guy to 
                         finish my ride for me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         So you've got it all arranged, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         You arranged it for me. I didn't 
                         have to do a thing.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Just who are you talking about?

                                     NEFF
                         An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. 
                         Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got 
                         into this because I knew a little 
                         something about insurance, didn't I? 
                         I was just a sucker. I'd have been 
                         brushed-off as soon as you got your 
                         hands on the money.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What are you talking about?

                                     NEFF
                         Save it. I'm telling this. It's been 
                         you and that Zachetti guy all along, 
                         hasn't it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's not true.

                                     NEFF
                         It doesn't make any difference whether 
                         it's true or not. The point is Keyes 
                         believes Zachetti is the guy he's 
                         been looking for. He'll have him in 
                         that gas chamber before he knows 
                         what happened to him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And what's happening to me all this 
                         time?

                                     NEFF
                         Don't be silly. What do you expect 
                         to happen to you? You helped him do 
                         the murder, didn't you? That's what 
                         Keyes thinks. And what's good enough 
                         for Keyes is good enough for me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe it's not good enough for me. 
                         Walter. Maybe I don't go for the 
                         idea. Maybe I'd rather talk.

                                     NEFF
                         Sometimes people are where they can't 
                         talk. Under six feet of dirt, for 
                         instance. And if it was you, they'd 
                         just charge it up to Zachetti, 
                         wouldn't they. One more item on his 
                         account. Sure they would. That's 
                         just what they're going to do. 
                         Especially since he's coming here, 
                         tonight... Oh, in about fifteen 
                         minutes from now, baby. With the 
                         cops right behind him. It's all taken 
                         care of.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And that'd make everything lovely 
                         for you, wouldn't it?

                                     NEFF
                         Right. And it's got to be done before 
                         that suit of yours comes to trial, 
                         and Lola gets a chance to sound off, 
                         and they trip you up on the stand, 
                         and you start to fold up and drag me 
                         down with you.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti 
                         here so they won't get a chance to 
                         trip me up. So we can get that money 
                         and be together.

                                     NEFF
                         That's cute. Say it again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He came here the first time just to 
                         ask where Lola was. I made him come 
                         back. I was working on him. He's 
                         crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I 
                         kept hammering into him that she was 
                         with another man, so he'd get into 
                         one of his jealous rages, and then 
                         I'd tell him where she was. And you 
                         know what he'd have done to her, 
                         don't you, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah, and for once I believe you. 
                         Because it's just rotten enough.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         We're both rotten, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Only you're just a little more rotten. 
                         You're rotten clear through. You got 
                         me to take care of your husband, and 
                         then you got Zachetti to take care 
                         of Lola, and maybe take care of me 
                         too, and then somebody else would 
                         have come along to take care of 
                         Zachetti for you. That's the way you 
                         operate isn't it, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've 
                         cooked up for tonight any better?

               Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for 
               a moment.

                                     NEFF
                         I don't like this music anymore. 
                         It's too close. Do you mind if I 
                         shut the window?

               Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window 
               and shuts it and draws the curtain. Phyllis speaks to his 
               back:

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Her voice low and 
                              urgent)
                         Walter!

               Neff turns, something changes in his face. There is the report 
               of a gun. He stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly 
               starts towards her. CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS SHOULDER at 
               Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. Neff stops 
               after he has taken a few steps.

                                     NEFF
                         What's the matter? Why don't you 
                         shoot again? Maybe if I came a little 
                         closer?

               Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again.

                                     NEFF
                         How's that. Do you think you can do 
                         it now?

               Phyllis is silent. She doesn't shoot. Her expression is 
               tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly he 
               takes the gun out of her unresisting hand.

                                     NEFF
                         Why didn't you shoot, baby?

               Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender.

                                     NEFF
                         Don't tell me it's because you've 
                         been in love with me all this time.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. I never loved you, Walter. Not 
                         you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to 
                         the heart. I used you, just as you 
                         said. That's all you ever meant to 
                         me -- until a minute ago. I didn't 
                         think anything like that could ever 
                         happen to me.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold 
                         me close.

               Neff draws her close to him. She reaches up to his face and 
               kisses him on the lips. As she comes out of the kiss there 
               is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.

                                     NEFF
                         Goodbye, baby.

               Out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers 
               in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp 
               against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to 
               the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost 
               tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines 
               on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly 
               turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat 
               and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent 
               that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the 
               blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly 
               goes out of the room, the way he came.

               D-21 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT)

               Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with 
               his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps 
               down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He 
               moves behind the palm tree near the walk.

               A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. 
               Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him.

                                     NEFF
                         Hey you. Come here a minute. I said 
                         come here, Zachetti.

               Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.

                                     NEFF
                         The name is Neff.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Yeah? And I still don't like it. 
                         What do you want?

                                     NEFF
                         Look, kid, I want to give you a 
                         present.

               He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a 
               coin.

                                     NEFF
                         Here's a nice new nickel.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         What's the gag?

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose you go back down the hill to 
                         a drug store and make a phone call.

               Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief 
               pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Keep your nickel and buy yourself an 
                         ice cream cone.

                                     NEFF
                         The number is Granite 0386. Ask for 
                         Miss Dietrichson. The first name is 
                         Lola.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And 
                         if I ever talk to her, it's not going 
                         to be over any telephone.

                                     NEFF
                         Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel. 
                         Take it and call her. She wants you 
                         to.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Yeah? She doesn't want any part of 
                         me.

                                     NEFF
                         I know who told you that, and it's 
                         not true. She's in love with you. 
                         Always has been. Don't ask me why. I 
                         couldn't even guess.

               Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the 
               nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him 
               to do it.

                                     NEFF
                         Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told 
                         you.

               He motions toward the street below.

                                     NEFF
                         That way.

               Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him 
               almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. 
               The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. 
               Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is 
               heard.

               Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the 
               house where he parked his car.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-22 NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the 
               dawn is slowly breaking.

               Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. There 
               are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. A 
               widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his 
               gray jacket. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a 
               note of utter exhaustion.

                                     NEFF
                         It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. 
                         It's cold. I wonder if she's still 
                         lying there alone in that house, or 
                         whether they've found her by now. I 
                         wonder a lot of things, but they 
                         don't matter any more, except I want 
                         to ask you to do me a favor. I want 
                         you to be the one to tell Lola, kind 
                         of gently, before it breaks wide 
                         open... Yes, and I'd like you to 
                         look after her and that guy Zachetti, 
                         so he doesn't get pushed around too 
                         much. Because...

               Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling 
               that he is not alone in the room.

               As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The 
               office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside 
               it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night 
               watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the 
               room over Keyes' shoulder.

               Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes 
               reaches back and pushes the door shut.

               Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a 
               faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

               Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without 
               answering.

                                     NEFF
                         Up pretty early, aren't you? I always 
                         wondered what time you got down to 
                         work.

               Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.

                                     NEFF
                         Or did your little man pull you out 
                         of bed?

                                     KEYES
                         The janitor did. Seems you leaked a 
                         little blood on the way in here.

                                     NEFF
                         Wouldn't be surprised.

               Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing 
               on the desk.

                                     NEFF
                         I wanted to straighten out that 
                         Dietrichson story for you.

                                     KEYES
                         So I gather.

                                     NEFF
                         How long have you been standing there?

                                     KEYES
                         Long enough.

                                     NEFF
                         Kind of a crazy story with a crazy 
                         twist to it. One you didn't quite 
                         figure out.

                                     KEYES
                         You can't figure them all, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         That's right. You can't, can you? 
                         And now I suppose I get the big 
                         speech, the one with all the two-
                         dollar words in it. Let's have it, 
                         Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         You're all washed up, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.

               They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense 
               effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a 
               little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is 
               bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse.

                                     KEYES
                         Walter, I'm going to call a doctor.

                                     NEFF
                              (Bitterly)
                         What for? So they can patch me up? 
                         So they can nurse me along till I'm 
                         back on my feet? So I can walk under 
                         my own power into that gas chamber 
                         up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes?

                                     KEYES
                         Something like that, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Well, I've got a different idea. 
                         Look here. Suppose you went back to 
                         bed and didn't find these cylinders 
                         till tomorrow morning, when the office 
                         opens. From then on you can play it 
                         any way you like. Would you do that 
                         much for me, Keyes?

                                     KEYES
                         Give me one good reason.

                                     NEFF
                         I need four hours to get where I'm 
                         going.

                                     KEYES
                         You're not going anywhere, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         You bet I am. I'm going across the 
                         border.

                                     KEYES
                         You haven't got a chance.

                                     NEFF
                         Good enough to try for.

                                     KEYES
                         You'll never make the border.

                                     NEFF
                         That's what you think. Watch me.

               Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, 
               holding himself upright with great effort.

                                     KEYES
                              (In a voice of stony 
                              calm)
                         You'll never even make the elevator.

               Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the 
               door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable 
               face.

                                     NEFF
                         So long, Keyes.

               Neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS 
               his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR 
               LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that 
               for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the 
               swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them 
               open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of 
               the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the 
               floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise.

               In background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                         Hello... Send an ambulance to the 
                         Pacific Building on Olive Street... 
                         Yeah... It's a police job.

               There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. 
               Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony 
               and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside 
               Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         How you doing, Walter?

               Neff manages a faint smile.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm fine. Only somebody moved the 
                         elevator a couple of miles away.

                                     KEYES
                         They're on the way.

                                     NEFF
                              (Slowly and with great 
                              difficulty)
                         You know why you didn't figure this 
                         one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy 
                         you were looking for was too close. 
                         He was right across the desk from 
                         you.

                                     KEYES
                         Closer than that, Walter.

               The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.

                                     NEFF
                         I love you too.

               Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it 
               out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief 
               drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his 
               pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great 
               difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is 
               too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it 
               for him and lights his cigarette.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

                

               The following pages are for an alternate ending that director 
               Billy Wilder actually shot but later decided against.

                                     KEYES
                         They're on the way.

                              (Slowly and with great 
                              difficulty)
                         You know why you didn't figure this 
                         one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy 
                         you were looking for was too close. 
                         He was right across the desk from 
                         you.

                                     KEYES
                         Closer than that, Walter.

               The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.

                                     NEFF
                         I love you too.

               Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it 
               out and clumsily wipes his face with it. Then, clutching the 
               handkerchief against his shoulder, he speaks to Keyes for 
               the last time.

                                     NEFF
                         At the end of that... trolley line... 
                         just as I get off... you be there... 
                         to say goodbye... will you, Keyes?

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                       SEQUENCE "E"

               FADE IN:

               E-1 WITNESS ROOM IN DEATH CHAMBER - SAN QUENTIN (DAY)

               Showing the witness room and approximately one-half of the 
               gas chamber. BOOM SHOT towards guard standing BACK TO CAMERA 
               at entrance door. Except for this guard the room is empty.

               Guard opens the door. Two other guards enter, followed by a 
               group of witnesses and newspaper men, each of whom removes 
               his hat as he enters the room. They form a group around the 
               outside of the gas chamber, some looking in through the glass 
               windows, some standing in the background on low platforms 
               against the wall.

               THE CAMERA SLOWLY BEGINS TO MOVE IN AND DOWN, AND CENTERS ON 
               Keyes, as he enters the room and stands behind the door. His 
               face is seen through the bars of the door, which is then 
               closed, and CAMERA MOVES TO A CLOSEUP. His eyes follow the 
               action of the closing door, then slowly look towards the gas 
               chamber.

               E-2 THE GAS CHAMBER, EMPTY

               On its windows show reflections of the spectators, including 
               the face of Keyes.

               The door to the gas chamber opens in the background, and 
               beyond that another door opens. Neff comes in between two 
               guards. He is wearing a white open-necked shirt, blue denim 
               pants, and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting. He moves 
               into the gas chamber, looks through the windows in the 
               direction of Keyes and nods quickly, recognizing him. The 
               guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal 
               chairs, with his back to the witnesses. They strap his arms, 
               legs and body to the chair. The guards go out.

               E-3 THE DOOR TO THE GAS CHAMBER

               It is open. The three guards come out of the gas chamber 
               into the ante-chamber, where stand the warden, executioner, 
               two doctors, the minister and the acid man, and possibly 
               several guards.

               The executioner and one guard close the door. The guard spins 
               the big wheel which tightens it. The wheel at first turns 
               very quickly, then, as it tightens, the guard uses 
               considerable force to seal the chamber tight. The guard steps 
               out of the shot. The gas chamber is now sealed.

               E-4 THE WITNESSES AND KEYES

               They are intently watching Neff in the gas chamber.

               E-5 THE ANTE-CHAMBER

               The warden looks slowly around the room, sees that everyone 
               is in his proper place and that the stethoscope, which one 
               doctor holds, is connected with the outlet in the wall of 
               the gas chamber. Also that the man in charge of the acid is 
               ready. The warden makes a motion to the acid man. The acid 
               man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a 
               countersunk receptacle under Neff's chair. (This action is 
               only suggested). The warden looks at the clock, then turns 
               to the executioner and nods.

               E-6 THE EXECUTIONER - MED. SHOT - CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN FROM 
               HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS EXECUTIONER

               He pushes a metal lever. (This immerses the pellets of cyanide 
               in the acid under the chair.)

               E-7 INT. GAS CHAMBER - MED. SHOT

               CAMERA IS SHOOTING ABOVE Neff's head (just out of shot), 
               towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber, Keyes 
               in the center. Gas floats up into scene between CAMERA and 
               spectators. Keyes, unable to watch, looks away.

               E-8 THE FIRST DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT

               as he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber. 
               He glances at the clock above his head.

               E-9 THE SECOND DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT

               He stands to right of the gas chamber door, taking notes on 
               a pad. He glances towards First Doctor (out of scene) and 
               looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber. The acid 
               man stands near him.

               E-10 THE FIRST DOCTOR

               CAMERA SHOOTING FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS HIM as he listens on 
               stethoscope. The doctor glances at the clock again. He takes 
               his stethoscope from his ears. He nods to the warden, This 
               indicates that the man is dead. CAMERA PANS with warden as 
               he turns to open the door connecting the ante-chamber with 
               the witness room.

               E-11 THE WITNESS ROOM - LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ON BOOM DOWN ON 
               WITNESSES GROUPED AROUND GAS CHAMBER

               The door connecting with the ante-chamber opens. A guard 
               comes through.

                                     GUARD
                         That's all, gentlemen, Vacate the 
                         chamber, please.

               The guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered. 
               The witnesses slowly start to file out. A guard has opened 
               the outer door. The witnesses put their hats on as they pass 
               through. A few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to 
               look in at the dead man before they leave.

               All the witnesses have now left, except Keyes, who stands, 
               shocked and tragic, beyond the door. The guard goes to him 
               and touches his arm, indicating to him that he must leave. 
               Keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and 
               slowly moves to go out.

               E-12 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBER

               CAMERA SHOOTING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AT KEYES, who is 
               just turning to leave. Keyes comes slowly out into the dark, 
               narrow corridor. His hat is on his head now, his overcoat is 
               pulled around him loosely. He walks like an old man. He takes 
               eight or ten steps, then mechanically reaches a cigar out of 
               his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth. His hands, in the 
               now familiar gesture, begin to pat his pockets for matches.

               Suddenly he stops, with a look of horror on his face. He 
               stands rigid, pressing a hand against his heart. He takes 
               the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the 
               door, CAMERA PANNING with him. When he has almost reached 
               the door, the guard stationed there throws it wide, and a 
               blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside.

               Keyes slowly walks out into the sunshine. stiffly, his head 
               bent, a forlorn and lonely man.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

FADE IN:


EXT. UNION STATION, WASHINGTON, D.C. DAY
LONG SHOT THE CAPITOL DOME IN THE B.G. AND THE AUTOMOBILE
ENTRANCE TO THE STATION IN THE F.G. LOW CAMERA

Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers
with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera.

We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands
out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis
rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the
passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes
and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark
colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The
feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of
scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up
and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of
this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to
be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are
all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of
the brogues.


INT. STATION LOBBY

CAMERA FOLLOWS the sport shoes and the brogues across the
lobby into a passenger tunnel. There is the usual activity
of passengers walking to and from, a loud-speaker announcing
trains, etc.


EXT. PASSENGER TUNNEL

As the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train
platform, CAMERA PANS them over to the steps of the train.


INT. TRAIN

The brogues and the sport shoes pass separately down the
aisle, the sport shoes turning in at a compartment door and
the brogues continuing toward the parlor car.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. PARLOR CAR (PROCESS)

down. A moment later the sport shoes come to rest. before
in adjoining chair.

The legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one
of the shoes touches one of the brogues.

                      MAN'S VOICE (over scene)
          Oh, excuse Me!

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two
parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport
shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes
with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always
had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking
but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is
GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well
dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely,
acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the
gesture implying he wants privacy.

                      BRUNO
              (smiling with sudden
               recognition)
          I beg your pardon, but aren't you
          Guy Haines.

Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known
tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience
before.

                      BRUNO
              (snapping his finger)
          Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right
          off the court in South Orange last
          season. What a backhand! Made the
          semi-finals, didn't you?

Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his
magazine rolled up in is fist.

                      BRUNO
              (with open admiration)
          I certainly admire people who do
          things.
              (smiling and
               introducing himself)
          I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy
          looks up. Bruno indicates his gold
          tie pin which bears his name in cut-
          out letters. Guy looks at it with
          the faintest expression of disdain.
          I suppose you think it's corny. But
          my mother gave it to me so of course
          I wear it to please her.

                      GUY
              (patiently)(a faint
               smile)
          How do you do.

                      BRUNO
              (with an apologetic
               grin)
          I don't usually talk so much.   Go
          Ahead and read.

                        GUY
              (wryly)
          Thanks.
Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open
appraisal.

                      BRUNO
          It must be pretty exciting to be so
          important.

                      GUY
              (fidgeting slightly)
          A tennis player isn't so important.

                      BRUNO
          People who do things are important.
          I never seem to do anything.

Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little
embarrassed.

                      BRUNO
              (still insistent on
               being friendly)
          I suppose you're going to Southampton --
          for the doubles.

                      GUY
              (politely)
          You are a tennis fan.

Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.

                      BRUNO
          Wish I could see you play. But I've
          got to be back in Washington tomorrow.
          I live in Arlington, you know.

He has taken out a cigarette case.   Holds it out to Guy.

                               BRUNO
             Cigarette?

                         GUY
             Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much.

                         BRUNO
             I smoke too much.

He fumbles for a match.          Guy brings out a lighter and hands
it to Bruno.

                         BRUNO
             Thanks.
                 (he stares at the
                  lighter, impressed)
             Elegant.

Guy reacts sharply.

                               GUY
                    (coldly)
             Yes?

                         BRUNO
             Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the
             sport page and look at the society
             news. And the pictures. She's very
             beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter.

                         GUY
             You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.

                         BRUNO
             Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from
             today's stock reports to Li'l Abner,
             and I got the answer.

                      BRUNO (CONT'D)
          Even news about people I don't know.
          Like who'd like to marry whom when
          his wife gets her divorce.

                      GUY
              (sharply)
          Perhaps you read too much.

                      BRUNO
              (contritely)
          There I go again. Too friendly. I
          meet someone I' like and open my yap
          too wide. I'm sorry...
At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.

                      GUY
          That's all right. Forget it.    I
          guess I'm pretty jumpy.

Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.

                      BRUNO
          There's a new cure for that.
              (to waiter)
          Scotch and plain water. A pair.
          Double.
              (to Guy with a chuckle)
          Only kind of doubles I play.

                      GUY
          You'll have to drink both of them.

                      BRUNO
              (grinning)
          And I can do it.
              (moving in)
          When's the wedding?

                      GUY
          What?

                      BRUNO
          The wedding. You and Anne Burton.
              (a gesture of
               explanation)
          It was in the papers.

                      GUY
          It shouldn't have been. Unless
          they've legalized bigamy overnight.

                     BRUNO
         I have a theory about that. I'd
         like to tell you about it some time.
         But right now I suppose divorce Is
         still the simplest operation.

The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter
into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he
gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a
glass to Guy. Guy takes it.

                     GUY

         I guess I will.

             (happily)
         This is wonderful -- having your
         company all the way to New York.

                     GUY
             (forced to explain)
         As a matter of fact, I'm not going
         direct. I'm stopping off. At
         Metcalf.

                     BRUNO
         Metcalf? What would anybody want to
         go there for?

                     GUY
         It's my home town.

                     BRUNO
         Oh, I get it! A little talk with
         your wife to about the divorce! I
         suppose she was the girl next door.
         Held her hand in high school and
         before you knew it -- hooked!

         Am I right?

                     GUY
             (laconically)
         Close enough.

                     BRUNO
             (raises his glass)
         Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up --
         then we'll have some lunch sent to
         my compartment.

          Thanks very much. But I think I'll
          go to the dining car.

              (motions the waiter

              (turns to Guy)

                      GUY
          Thanks just the same, but I really
          don't think --

                      BRUNO
          Oh, go on and order.

The waiter is hovering impatiently.   Guy gives in out of
embarrassment.

          Well, I'll Just have a hamburger and
          a cup of coffee.

INT. BRUNO'S COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS)

Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking
and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor
bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with
gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted
cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table.
Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights
his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.

                      BRUNO
          Sure, I went to college. Three of
          them. Every time they kicked me out
          my father threw me back in.
              (bitterly)
          He finally gave up. He thinks I'm
          awfully small fry, not worth the
          bait.
              (wistfully)
          You my friend, Guy?

                       GUY
          Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno.

                      BRUNO
              (a little woozy)
          No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm
          anything special. Only my mother.
              (empties the bottle
               into his glass)
          My father hates me.

Guy smiles this off as nonsense.

                      GUY
          You must be imagining things.

                      BRUNO
              (hitting the bottom
               of the bottle for
               the last drop)
          And I hate him. He thinks   I ought
          to catch the eight-five bus  every
          morning, punch a timeclock  and work
          my way up selling paint or  something.
          Him -- with all his money!

                      GUY
              (amused by Bruno)
          Well, what do you want to do?

                      BRUNO
          You mean before or after I kill him?

               GUY
       (chuckling)
   Before, of course.

               BRUNO
       (leaning forward
        eagerly)
   I want to do everything. I got a
   theory you're supposed to do
   everything before you die. Have you
   ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a
   hundred and fifty miles an hour?

                 GUY
   Not lately.
               BRUNO
   I did. I flew in a jet plans too.
       (his hand traces a
        swift streak through
        the air, and he adds
        sound effects)
   Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill!
   Almost blow the sawdust out of my
   head. I'm going to make a reservation
   on the first rocket to the moon...

               GUY
       (amused and curious)
   What are you trying prove?

               BRUNO
   I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky.
   You're smart. Marrying the boss's
   daughter is a nice short cut to a
   career, isn't it?

               GUY
       (quickly)
   Marrying the senator's daughter has
   nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow
   look past a tennis not without being
   a goldbricker?

               BRUNO
   Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend,
   remember? I'd do anything for you.

               GUY
       (humoring Bruno)
   Sure, Bruno, sure.

    We'll be pulling in soon. I've got
    to change trains.

                BRUNO
    What'd you say her name was -- your
    wife's?

                GUY
    Miriam.

                BRUNO
    That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines.
    Played around a lot, I suppose?
                GUY
    Let's not talk about it any more.

                 BRUNO
         (almost hopefully)
    Maybe she'll make more trouble for
    you.

                GUY
    I don't think so.

                BRUNO
    You mean you got enough on her to
    get your divorce no matter what?

                GUY
    Let's change subject, Bruno, can't
    we?

                BRUNO
    Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one
    of my ideas for murdering my father?

                GUY
        (indicating the
         detective novels)
    You've been reading too many of these.

                BRUNO
        (going right on)
    You want to hear about the busted
    light socket in the bathroom, or the
    carbon monoxide in the garage?

                GUY
    No. I may be old fashioned, but I
    thought murder was against the law.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org       11.



                BRUNO
    But not against the law of nature.
    My theory is that everybody is a
    potential murderer. Didn't you ever
    want to kill somebody? Say one of
    those useless fellows Miriam was
    running around with?

                GUY
    You can't go around killing people
    just because you think they're
    useless.

                BRUNO
    Oh, what's a life or two? Some people
    are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your --
    wife and my father, for instance.
    It reminds me of a wonderful idea
    had once. I used to put myself to
    sleep at night -- figuring it out.
    Now, let's say you want to get rid
    of your wife.

                GUY
    Why?

                BRUNO
    Let's say she refuses to give you a
    divorce --
        (raises a finger and
         stops Guy's protest)
    Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill
    her because you'd get caught. And
    what would trip you up? Motive.
    Now here's the plan...

                GUY
    I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.

                BRUNO
        (ignoring the remark)
    It's so simple, too. A couple of
    fellows meet accidentally, like you
    and me. No connection between them
    at all. Never saw each other before.
    Each of them has somebody he'd like
    to get rid of, but he can't murder
    the person he wants to get rid of.
    He'll get caught. So they swap
    murders.

                GUY
    Swap murders?

                      BRUNO
          Each fellow does the other fellow's
          murder. Then there is nothing to
          connect them. The one who had the
          motive isn't there. Each fellow
          murders a total stranger. Like you
          do my murder and I do yours.

                      GUY
              (with relief)
          We're coming into my station.

                       BRUNO

              (sharply)
          What?

                      BRUNO
              (with a smile)
          We do talk the same language -- don't
          we, Guy?

                      GUY
              (preparing to leave)
          Sure, we talk the same language.
          Thanks for the lunch.

                      BRUNO
              (beaming)
          I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought
          the lamb chops were a little overdone
          myself.

He holds out his hand.   Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands.

pianos and radios on display, and the sound of a piano being

customer at a counter. MR. HARGREAVES, the manager, is busy

In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a
customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle
another customer is listening to a record of popular music.
A third cubicle is empty. Activity of the street is seen

Guy walks straight to Miriam, just as she is finishing with
her woman customer, handing over a small package.

          You're looking well, Miriam.

Miriam's face is pretty because it is still young. She is
self-centered and inclined to be vindictive. She wears
harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her
eyes look small.

          When you wouldn't give me the divorce
          right away, I sort of hoped it was
          because you were a little bit jealous.

          I got over being jealous, a long

closer, within listening range.

               glass cubicle)

Guy follows Miriam across to the empty room.   Miriam has
brought her purse along.

They enter.


INT. CUBICLE

Once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts
of the shop are heard but very faintly. The piano tuning
still goes on, but less stridently. Miriam and Guy are cooped
together in the close quarters.

          Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty
          late to start flirting with a
          discarded husband. Especially when
          you're going to have another man's
          baby.

                      MIRIAM
          To have my baby and be with you.

                       GUY
          Why me?   It's not my baby.

                      MIRIAM
          But people don't know that, Guy, do
          they? It would make a pretty story,
          wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter
          involved with a married man who's
          about to become a father.

                      GUY
              (furiously)
          You black conniving little liar!

A few people in the shop look around as Guy's voice rises
above the sound of the record playing.

                      MIRIAM
          Keep your voice down.

                      GUY
          What happened? Did he run out on
          you?

                      MIRIAM
          No man runs out on me.   Not even
          you.

                      GUY
          You're a liar and a  cheat,   Miriam.
          You've wanted to get  rid of   me long
          enough and now I'll  go you   one better --
          I never want to see  or hear   of you
          again.

                       MIRIAM
              (demurely)
          I could be very pathetic as the
          deserted little mother in a courtroom,
          Guy. Think it over. Who would
          believe you?

Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm
across the record with a loud screech. From outside we can
see heads turn. Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very
disturbed.


MED. SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES' VIEWPOINT
We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing
her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his
words. The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something
like cringing fear has taken its place. She is drawn and
tense and seems to cower beneath Guy's rage.

Mr. Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guy's tirade.

                      GUY
          ...That's what should happen to people
          like you. And if I...

                      HARGREAVES
              (interrupts)
          Break it up, folks. This isn't the
          place for a family quarrel.

                      GUY
              (his eyes blazing)
          Sorry. I'm leaving.

He starts to exit from the booth.   Miriam grabs his arm and
screams at him:

                      MIRIAM
              (yelling like a
               fishwife)
          You heard what I said, Guy Haines.
          You can't throw me away like an old
          shoe. I'm coming to Washington to
          have my baby. Tell that to the
          senate!

Guy strides out of the store, the manager and a few customers
turning around in surprise.

The two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open
their doors simultaneously and Miriam's tirade is climaxed
by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and
the apparently unaware piano tuner.


EXT. MAIN STREET METCALF SHOOTING TOWARDS STATION

Guy is striding along angrily. He comes to the same
intersection and the same cop. The officer makes a friendly
gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides
past him without noticing.


EXT. METCALF STATION (PROCESS)
Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone
booths, enters one. Inside the telephone booth, he dumps
some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the
telephone, speaks into it.

                      GUY
          Long distance.
              (a pause)
          I want Washington, D. C. The number
          is Republic 0800. Person to person.
          Miss Anne Burton.

Another pause, very long. Guy is very restless. He digs a
cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then
looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it.
He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to
him.

                      GUY
              (continuing)
          Right.

Guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the
telephone, then waits. He shifts the receiver and fumbles
in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone.

                      GUY
              (tautly, into phone)
          Anne, -- Anne darling. Yes, I'm in
          Metcalf --
              (gets a grip on himself)
          No, everything didn't go smoothly.

INT. BURTON LIVING ROOM

ANNE BURTON is a beautiful, high-spirited and well-bred young
woman. The smile on her face his faded to anxiety as she
listens over the telephone which is on the desk.

              (after a pause then
               with unpleasant
               realization)
          Another man's child! But she can't
          do that to you, Guy -- it's
          unbelievable -- it's, it's evil!
              (she listens, then
               calmly)
          Yes, I know how you must feel.
              (pause)
          But you sound so savage.


BACK TO GUY IN TELEPHONE BOOTH

                       GUY
              (furiously)
          Sure I sound savage. I feel savage.
          I'd like to break her neck!
              (a pause, then raising
               his voice)
          I said I'd like to break her foul,
          poisonous, useless little neck!
              (the connection is
               bad and he strains
               to hear)
          What's that?

Meantime the noise of a through train has been HEARD, and
the horn on a streamliner locomotive. It has come up very
fast, it is now almost to the station. Guy rises his voice
and yells into the telephone. His voice fights the roar of
the train:

                      GUY
          I SAID I COULD STRANGLE HER!

The expression on his face is frenzied and suggesting that
he means exactly what he is saying.

INT. ANTHONY LIVING ROOM

The scene opens on a CLOSEUP OF A MAN'S HANDS. One of them
is semi-flexed and turning slowly, The other is receiving
the final touches of a manicure.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that these are Bruno's hands,
and that, he is studying them moodily, CAMERA PULLS BACK
FARTHER to reveal his mother, MRS. ANTHONY, sitting opposite
him at a little table in the Anthony living room. She is
working with scissors, file and nail buffer. Mrs. Anthony
is a gentle, once pretty woman, whose pastel exterior harbors
a tigress-like determination to protect her son, Bruno is in
his robe and is unshaven.
There is evidence of long established wealth in the heavy
dark appointments of this room.

                      MRS. ANTHONY
          Since you insisted on a manicure,
          dear, I do wish you'd keep your hands
          quiet. You're so restless lately.

                      BRUNO
              (almost dreamily as
               he admires the free
               hand)
          I like them to look just right.

Mrs. Anthony looks up, notices his moody expression.

                      MRS. ANTHONY
          Did I file them too short?

                       BRUNO
          No, Ma.   They look fine.   Thanks.

                      MRS. ANTHONY
          Then what's the matter?

                      BRUNO
          I'm all right, Ma.   Don't worry about
          me.

                       MRS. ANTHONY
          You look so Pale, dear. Are you out
          of vitamins?

                      BRUNO

          But you have that 'look'. I can
          always tell. You haven't got into
          any more mischief, Bruno?

He denies this with a slow, solemn shake of his head.

                      MRS. ANTHONY
          I do hope you've forgotten about
          that silly little plan of yours?

                      BRUNO

          Which one?
                      MRS. ANTHONY
              (smiling)
          About blowing up the White House?

                      BRUNO
              (his eyes dancing)
          I was only kidding, Ma. Besides,
          what would the president say?

                      MRS. ANTHONY
              (laughing gaily)
          You're a naughty boy, Bruno. But
          you can always make me laugh.
              (she rises)
          Now get shaved, dear, before your
          father gets home.

Bruno's fist crashes down on the little table, upsetting it,
as he gets to his feet.

                      BRUNO
          I'm sick and tired of bowing and
          scraping to the king.

                         MRS. ANTHONY
                 (placating him)
          Now,    now, Let's not lose control.
          Come    see my painting, dear --
                 (she leads him toward
                  an easel)
          I do    wish you'd take up painting.
          It's    such a soothing pastime.

They look at the painting.

INSERT

The painting is a horrible mess. Out of the violence of the
pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild-eyed and
distorted. We hear laughter from Bruno.


BACK TO SCENE

Bruno's roar of laughter puzzles Mrs. Anthony, but she is
pleased to hear his good humor. He puts an arm around her.

                      BRUNO
          You're wonderful, Ma! It's the old
          boy, all right. That's father!
                      MRS. ANTHONY
              (bewildered)
          It is? I was trying to paint Saint
          Francis.

At this moment there is the sound of the front door opening.
Then immediately the telephone bell rings in the hall. Bruno
is instantly alert, as if he had been expecting a call. He
goes toward the door to the hall, as the butler enters.

                      BUTLER
              (to Bruno)
          They are ready with your call to
          Southampton, Sir.

Bruno's father MR. ANTHONY, purposefully enters the living
room. He an impeccably dressed business man with an
uncompromising eye. His entrance momentarily blocks Bruno's
exit.

                      MRS. ANTHONY
              (to her husband)
          How nice that you're early, Charles.
          I'll tell cook....

Bruno now exits into the hall, passing his father without
speaking.

                      MR. ANTHONY
          Just a minute, Eunice.
              (calls after Bruno)

CAMERA MOVES IN TO A BIG HEAD CLOSEUP OF BRUNO at the
telephone as the Voices of his mother and father can be heard
from the other room.
                      MR. ANTHONY'S VOICE
          Now it's hit and run driving! And
          you knew about it all the time!

          often. After all we do have a
          responsibility to society.

Bruno gives a look in his father's direction, before he speaks
into the telephone in a low voice.

          you remember? On the train.

The voices of Mr. and Mrs. Anthony can still be heard in
dispute as Bruno listens at phone:

                      MRS. ANTHONY
          I never permit it!

Bruno gives a significant look in direction of the living
room as he speaks into the phone.
                       BRUNO
              (softly)
          Are you getting your divorce?

               satisfaction)
          So she double-crossed you!   Are you
          going to see her again?

The phone clicks in Bruno's ear. He looks hurt for an
instant, then replaces the receiver. Bruno listens to his
father off scene and his expression becomes more enigmatic.

                      MR. ANTHONY'S VOICE
          I tell you, Eunice, I'm going to
          have that boy put away if it's the
          last thing I do!

Bruno looks off in direction of his farther's voice with an
expression which says, "Crow while you can, you haven't
much time." He reaches into his pocket, brings out Guy's
cigarette lighter and as he flicks it on and off.

direction of the town.    He approaches the row of telephone
booths.

Again from Bruno's viewpoint, we see Miriam's house. At
this moment the front door swings open, emitting a long streak
ot bright light. We see the silhouette of a woman emerge,
followed by two other men. They're laughing and joking.
Suddenly they look up the street. At this very moment the
bus pulls up in front of Bruno's view, cutting off the sight
of his quarry. The bus comes to a stop.

Bruno rises in alarm and moves around toward the end of the
bus so that he shall not lose sight of the girl coming out
of the house.

From his viewpoint, the girl, whom we now see is Miriam, is
running followed by the two young men. They are calling for
the bus not to go - shouting, "Hi - stop!" Mrs. Joyce calls

where the aim is to swing the hammer hard enough down onto
its target to ring the bell and register the 100 mark. Miriam
is in the foreground of the shot. The first boy steps up to
try his hand. As he swings, Miriam turns and glances about
her, obviously looking for Bruno.

CLOSE SHOT MIRIAM

She turns away and is lost in the crowd.


MEDIUM SHOT OVER BRUNO'S SHOULDER AT MERRY-GO ROUND IN
BACKGROUND

Bruno turns to follow Miriam, his manner casual. As he takes
a few steps, WE PAN ACROSS with him until, over his shoulder,
we see a merry-go-round in the background. Miriam and the
two boys are aboard and climbing onto horses. As Bruno goes
toward the merry-go-round, the CAMERA MOVES UP A LITTLE with
him. The merry-go-round starts to move slowly round as Bruno
hops on.


MEDIUM SHOT ON MERRY-GO-ROUND

Bruno begins to look around for Miriam, who is apparently on
the other side of the merry-go-round. He starts to thread
his way through the horses which are beginning to move up
and down. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. He passes one or two of
the oncoming heads before he reaches Miriam. She is on an
outside mount which is high in the air when she sees Bruno
facing her. Her laughter dies for a moment and she smiles
at him coyly. Bruno passes her and gets on the horse directly
behind her, Miriam glancing at him as her horse comes down.

Across the water may be seen a small wooded island. Between
this and the boat landing there is an artificially constructed

We see Miriam and her companions approach the boat concession
and CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM onto the little landing stage. CAMERA
MOVES UP SLOWLY over the boy's shoulders until we get MIRIAM

coy smile of satisfaction as she sees:

MEDIUM SHOT (FROM MIRIAM'S VIEWPOINT)

Bruno is approaching the pay box.


MEDIUM SHOT

Miriam and her companions are escorted to a small boat with
electric motor. Once they are seated the boat chugs away
from the landing stage and off into the darkness.

Bruno steps into the foreground and gets into the next boat
which floats alongside. He, too, moves away into the
darkness.

ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL

As Miriam's boat passes through, she gives another little
glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the
darkness of the tunnel.

After a brief moment Bruno's boat comes into the picture,
and it, too, goes into the tunnel.


INSIDE THE TUNNEL

We see the silhouettes of the occupants of Miriam's boat on
the wall of the tunnel, lit dimly from the light coming from
the tunnel exit.

The silhouette of Bruno in his boat, lit by the tunnel
entrance, gradually approaches the other three. When the
silhouettes are almost touching, we --

EXIT OF THE TUNNEL

It is empty. There is a sudden piercing scream from inside,
followed after a second or two by protestations and giggling
as Miriam's boat emerges into the light. She is pushing one
of the boys away from her.

                      MIRIAM
              (squealing)
          George, stop it, I tell you!

Their boat moves out of the picture, toward the island.
Presently Bruno's boat comes smilingly following and he,
too, moves on out of the picture.

MEDIUM SHOT ISLAND

The group of Miriam and her companions are scrambling out of
their boat and moving onto the island, one of the boys trying
the boat on the shore. They disappear into the Woods of the
island.

Again Bruno's boat comes into the picture. He steps out,
lift the prow of the boat a little onto the shore.


LONG SHOT ISLAND

We see the amusement park lighted beyond the lake.
Silhouetted in the foreground, the trees and foliage of the
island. Nearby we see the silhouetted figures of Miriam and
her companions move across the scene, right to left. Miriam
is pushing George away from her.

                      MIRIAM
              (protesting
               perfunctorily)
          George, no!

She backs away from him and the boys go on picture. Miriam
goes in another direction, around, the bushes. George
obviously misses her, for we hear his voice call out:

                      GEORGE'S VOICE
          Miriam!

Miriam backs out of the bushes   until the back of her head is
in CLOSEUP in the foreground of   the shot. Suddenly she hears
steps in back of her and turns   her head toward CAMERA. Her
face changes as she recognizes   someone offscene.

                      MIRIAM
          Oh!

She gives a coy smile of recognition. CAMERA   PULLS BACK to
reveal the mad and shoulders of Bruno between  Miriam and the
camera. His hand holds Guy's lighter which he   flicks on as
he raises it above Miriam's face. 0f Bruno, we  see only the
back of his head and shoulders.

                      BRUNO
          Is your name Miriam?

                      MIRIAM

We see Bruno's gloved hands dart quickly to Miriam's throat.
The lighter falls down out of picture, and as Bruno's hands
grip her throat, his head moves slightly to blot out Miriam's
face. His head moves a bit farther until Miriam's face is
nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen, and we see
her glasses fall off.


CLOSE SHOT

Miriam's glasses hit the ground. The shadows of their
struggling figures over the shot.


CLOSE UP
The screen is filled with one of the lenses  of the glasses.
They are of the diminishing type. Against   the moonlit sky
we see reflected, the elongated struggling  figures, as though
we were shooting up at them. Suddenly one   of the figures
falls forward.


CLOSE UP

Miriam's head drops into the picture by the glasses.

Bruno's hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses.
One of the lenses has been broken by Miriam's fall.

As we see Bruno's sport shoes move away, the CAMERA MOVES
PAST MIRIAM'S HEAD until it comes to Guy's lighter pressed
into the earth.


CLOSE UP BRUNO

Bruno glances back over his shoulder.   He looks down and
goes back one or two steps.


CLOSE UP BRUNO'S HAND

Bruno's hands retrieve the lighter from the ground.


LONG SHOT ISLAND

We see a full view of the island again, with the amusement
park beyond. The faint noise of the calliope continues in
the distance. Bruno has been lost to view.

Miriam's companions are still searching for her.   We hear
their faint voices in the distance.

                       VOICES
          Miriam!   Miriam! Where are you?


MEDIUM SHOT

Bruno comes to the shore where his boat is moored. He gets
in and is quickly chugging away. He moves calmly, matter-of-
fact and not furtively.


LONG SHOT LAKE
Bruno's boat throbbing its way across toward the landing
stage.


MEDIUM SHOT LANDING STAGE

There are two boats unloading. Bruno's boat is approaching.
We hear a loud call from the island. Someone has found
Miriam.

                      VOICES
          Hey, here she is! What's the matter
          with her? Has she fainted?

More shouts from the island cause the people at the landing
stage to look back.  The boatman's attention is also
attracted. Suddenly,  as Bruno is getting out of boat, there
is a loud scream from the island.

                       VOICE
              (crying out)
          She is dead!

                      OTHER VOICE
              (from island)
          Help! Help!

Bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and
in company with the other people, is looking back as if to
see what's wrong on the island. Then he moves away, starting
off of the landing stage. The boatman turns and glances at
Bruno, but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance
across on the island. He hurries forward and with a couple
of men passengers jumps into one of the boats. He calls to
his assistant as he gets into the boat.

The assistant runs off out of the pictures


MEDIUM SHOT BRUNO

As Bruno calmly threads his way along the midway, we hear
above the noise of the various concessions, a shrill police
whistle in the distance. Presently a couple of policemen
comes running from direction of the main entrance and past
Bruno. He glances at them over his shoulder, then strolls
on toward the main entrance to the park.

ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK EXTERIOR

As Bruno comes out through the turnstile, he stands for a
moment on the street. At this moment a man hesitates at the
curbstone. He is blind and tapping the sidewalk with his
white cane. He takes one step into the roadway, then
hesitates. Bruno steps forward and takes the blind man's
arm. CAMERA PULLS BACK as Bruno escorts the blind man across
the road. With a sweeping gesture he holds back a couple of
cars to lot them pass.

Once on the other side of the road, the blind man utters his
thanks.

                       BLIND MAN

He goes off.

Bruno looks back toward the park, then glances down at his
wristwatch.

Guy turns and starts to move in across the street.

                      BRUNO
          Wait a minute, Guy. To have to talk.
          We have to arrange things.

Guy turns at the door to his apartment building.

                       GUY
              (furiously)
          Get away before I give you what you
          gave Miriam.

                      BRUNO
              (sadly)
          You're not yourself, Guy. You're
          tired. When you think things over,
          you'll see I'm right. Tomorrow --

Guy opens his door, turns on Bruno.

                      GUY
              (with finality)
          I don't know you. I never saw you
          before. I never want to see you
          again.

He goes in and slams the door in Bruno's face.

                      BRUNO
              (to the closed door)
          But we have to --

He realizes there is no use in trying to talk to Guy any
further. He turns and faces the CAMERA IN CLOSE UP as he
moves away, looking sad almost to the point of tears.


INT. GUY'S APARTMENT

Guy is standing at the telephone which is still ringing. He
has Miriam's glasses in his hand. He looks down at them for
a moment, then picks up the receiver. He hesitates, then
speaks into the phone.

                         GUY
                 (hoarsely, into phone)
          Yes?
              (Pause)
          Yes, Anne. I'm sorry, darling.   I
          just got in.
              (pause)
          Of course I'm all right.

          But you sound upset. Is anything
          wrong?
              (Pause)
          All right. I'll come over. Right
          away.

He hangs up but keeps his hand on the telephone, deliberating.
He starts to dial, then suddenly hangs up and starts out.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET, WASHINGTON LONG SHOT NIGHT

A taxi drives up and stops in front of a handsome residence.
It is the Burton home. Guy gets out of the taxi and goes up
the steps.


MED. SHOT OVER GUY'S SHOULDER

His figure tense, he rings the   bell. After a moment's wait,
the door is opened from inside   and Anne Burton stands in the
lighted hallway. She looks at    Guy with an anxious, taut
expression, searches his face   hastily, then as he takes a
step inside she is suddenly in   his arms. They embrace with
wordless fervor.

                      GUY
              (holding her close)
          Anne darling, you're trembling.

Anne draws back and looks into his face as if searching for
an answer to some question in her mind.

                       ANNE
          Guy --
               (her fingers gently
                touch his face)
          I wonder if you know how much I love
          you.

Guy takes her hand from hIs face, caresses it with his lips.

                      GUY
              (forcing a smile)
          Brazen woman. I'm the one to say
          that.

            But I wanted you to know, before...
                (forcing herself to
                 be calm)
            Before we go into the living room.

Father wants to see you.


CLOSEUP GUY

He looks apprehensively in direction of the living room,
conscious of what the news is to be, but covering up.

LONG SHOT LIVING ROOM FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT

SENATOR BURTON and BARBARA BURTON are seated near a desk on
the farthest side of the room. Senator Burton is a
distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition,
his family and his career. Barbara, Anne's younger sister,
is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly
what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it.
Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam.
She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is
speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a
weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the
hallway, Barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward Guy.
They both wait for him to enter.


CLOSEUP GUY

He steels himself for the long walk across the hall and the
living room.


CLOSEUP ANNE

Watching Guy closely.


MED. SHOT

As Guy starts to make the long trek across the living room,
with Anne behind him --

                        GUY
                (stiffly)
            Good evening, sir.   Hello, Babs.

     Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 48.



Barbara has been squirming in her seat, then as if jet
propelled she catapults out of it and runs to Guy, giving
him a big hug and a smack on the cheek.

                      BARBARA
          Something awful has happened, Guy.

                       SENATOR
              (firmly)
          Sit down, Barbara.

Subdued, she sits down.   But Guy remains standing.

                      SENATOR
              (finding it difficult
               to begin)
          There seems to be no way of
          diplomatically breaking tragic news.
          I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to
          tell you. It concerns your wife.
          She's been murdered.

Guy stares woodenly at the Senator, is if hypnotized.

                      BARBARA
          The police have been using everything
          but radar to locate you.

                      SENATOR
          You're to call Headquarters at
          Metcalf.

The full impact of what has happened hits Guy once more.

                      GUY
          Miriam...murdered.

                      ANNE
              (with inner tension)
          She was...strangled.

Slowly Guy's eyes meet hers. They are remembering what he
said on the phone: "I could strangle her." He sinks into a
chair. The Senator is quite distressed.

During the following scene Barbara quietly goes about the
business of pouring drinks and serving them. She knows
everyone's preference.

                SENATOR
        (wrylt, to Guy)
    It happened on an island in an
    amusement park. It was sort of a
    lovers lane, I believe. A rather
    sordid atmosphere.

                BARBARA
        (quickly, to Guy)
    Miriam went there with two boys.
    They were the ones who found her.
    So they're not suspects. But you
    probably will be.

                 SENATOR
    Young lady, we can't overlook the
    fact that murder is at our doorsteps.
    But I forbid you to drag it into the
    living room!

                BARBARA
        (wide-eyed)
    Let's not fool ourselves. The police
    will say Guy wanted Miriam out of
    the way so he could marry Anne. In
    a crime of this sort the police first
    go after the husband, and Guy had
    every motive.

                   SENATOR
        (aghast)
    Motive?

                GUY
        (quietly)
    She's right. Whichever way you look
    at it...I'm in a spot.

                SENATOR
        (disconcerted but
         whistling in dark)
    Oh come now, my boy. I'm sure you
    have nothing to worry about.

                 BARBARA
        (flatly)
    If he hasn't an alibi for nine-thirty
    tonight he has plenty to worry about.

          You can tell them where you were,

                      GUY
              (wearily)
          At nine-thirty I was on the train
          from New York to Washington.

                      SENATOR
              (relieved)
          There you are.
                      BARBARA
          Who saw you? Did you speak to anyone?
          You'll need a Witness, you know.

                      GUY
              (as if it didn't matter)
          Yes, I spoke to someone.

                      SENATOR
              (hopefully)
          Anyone you know?

                     GUY
          No. His name was Collins.   He is a
          professor.

                      SENATOR
              (brightening)
          Harvard.

The Senator's expression says: "Well, that's not too bad."

          It can't be helped, darling. It is
          not your fault. It's not as though
          anyone can say you had something to
          do with it.

          to keep you all out of this mess.

          lose any sleep over accusations.
              (an afterthought)
          Unless they can be proved, of course.
          We'll help all we can. Dreadful

          unfortunate girl.

Barbara pokes her head quickly around the door.

Left alone, Guy and Anne embrace. Anne's nervous tension
comes to the surface in a flood of relief.

                       ANNE
           I told myself over and over I was
           being silly, but there was one
           horrible moment tonight when the
           news came through. I kept remembering

           Metcalf.

Anne quickly puts her fingers over his mouth.

                       ANNE
           Don't even say it.   Forget you ever
           said it. Even more   terrifying than
           the murder itself,  Guy, was the awful
           thought that if you  had anything to
           do with it we'd be  separated, -perhaps
           forever. I'd never   see you again.

EXT. METCALF POLICE HEADQUARTERS DAY

A knot of people are hanging around the entrance, including
a few newspaper photographers. There is a rush of interest
when a taxi pulls up and Guy steps out of it. Guy pushes
his way through the people. Two or three bulbs flash. There
is a murmur from the crowd and we hear Guy's name. He passes
into the entrance.


INT. CORRIDOR OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS

Guy comes into the corridor from the street and approaches
two policemen who are standing nearby.
                      GUY
          Captain Turley's office?

One of the policemen gestures to a door at the right.    Guy
crosses and enters.


INT. RECEPTION ROOM OUTSIDE CAPTAIN TURLEY'S OFFICE

At one side of the room is a young police sergeant seated at
a typewriter. A group of people are seated in chairs lined
against the opposite wall.

Guy enters, crosses to the sergeant at the desk.

                      GUY
          Captain Turley is expecting me.   Guy

He rises and goes into an adjoining room.

He now has time to take stock of the waiting people.    He
catches his breath when he sees:

He looks about him uncomfortably, then turns suddenly as he
sees:


MED. SHOT

Seated behind Guy, apart from the others who are waiting, is
Professor Collins, Guy's drunken companion on the train of
the night before. The professor is completely sober now,
dignified and erect. He has removed his glasses to polish
them and does not react to Guy's presence.


CLOSEUP GUY

Guy starts with a smile of recognition to say, "How do you
do?" but at that moment he hears the door open and his name
called:

                        SERGEANT'S VOICE
            Will you come in, please, Mr. Haines?

Guy breaks away from his uncompleted greeting to the professor
and goes through the door to Captain Turley's office, followed
by the eyes of the waiting people.

INT. CAPTAIN TURLEY'S OFFICE

CAPTAIN TURLEY is conscientious, methodical and always polite.
He puts aside photographs and records and rises from behind
his desk as Guy comes in. A detective lieutenant, CAMPBELL,
is attending a coffee maker. Their expressions are grave by
contrast with Guy's confident attitude after seeing the
professor in the waiting room.

                        CAPTAIN TURLEY
            Good of you to be so prompt, Mr.
            Haines. This is Lieutenant Campbell.

The professor studies Guy for a moment, then awkwardly turns
to Turley.

                         COLLINS
             I'm terribly sorry, but I really
             don't remember meeting this gentleman.


CLOSEUP GUY

Surprised.    His confident expression fades.


CLOSEUP PROFESSOR COLLINS
He turns from the captain to Guy.

                         COLLINS
                 (apologetically)
             Unfortunately, I remember very little
             about the journey from New York...You
             see, there had been a little
             celebration --


MED. SHOT GROUP

Guy interrupts with a slight note of impatience.

                         GUY
             But we were sitting opposite each
             other in the observation car! You
             were singing a song about a goat --

                         COLLINS
                 (incredulously)
             A goat?

                         GUY
                 (urgently)
             And calculus. You were going over a
             speech you'd made.

Turley and Campbell are watching closely.

                         COLLINS
             I was? I'm sorry, Mr. Halnes.
                 (shakes his head)
             I certainly must have celebrated!   I
             can't remember you at all.

CLOSEUP GUY

Momentarily Guy is frustrated, then he turns quietly to
Turley.

                      GUY
              (calmly, logically)
          Captain, is it so important whether
          or not Professor Collins remember
          me? Surely, the important thing is
          that I've been able to name a man
          who was on the train with me. You've
          been able to find him. Isn't that
          proof of where I was at nine-thirty
          last night?
Guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he
has clearly established his alibi.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


INT. BURTON LIVING ROOM EVENING

The Burtons are having coffee. Barbara has been glancing
through a new murder mystery with a lurid cover. As Guy
enters, Anne rises to greet him.

                      ANNE
          Hello, darling. Have you had your
          dinner?

                      GUY
          On the train.

                      ANNE
          You weren't in Metcalf all this time?
          We expected you hours ago.

                       BARBARA
              (flatly)
          I didn't. They sometimes throw a
          suspect in the can and keep him there
          all night.

                      SENATOR
              (after a disapproving
               glance at Barbara)
          Sit down, Guy. Sit down.    Give him
          some coffee, Anne.

                SENATOR (CONT'D)
        (back to Guy)
    You had no trouble with the police
    of course, once they verified your
    alibi?

                GUY
        (morosely)
    When an alibi is full of bourbon,
    sir, it can't stand up.

                BARBARA
    You mean the professor was boiled?

                  GUY
    Completely.    He didn't remember me.

                ANNE
    But, you knew he was on the train!
    Wasn't that enough to prove you were
    on it, too?

                GUY
    Apparently not at the right time.
    They suggested I could have caught
    the train at Baltimore after Miriam
    was murdered. They had it all worked
    out --
        (taps his head)
    in their timetables.

                ANNE
        (growing indignant
         and increasingly
         nervous)
    That's ridiculous. They're acting
    as if you were guilty.

                BARBARA
        (somewhat subdued and
         trying to be
         comforting)
    Everything will be all right, Anne.
    The police were just being thorough --
        (she's unsure of
         herself, and defers
         to the senator)
    Weren't they, daddy?

                 SENATOR
    I certainly hope so.
        (to Guy)
    What is your next step?

          Whatever it is, the police will know
          it. They gave me a present -- come
          take a look.

He crosses to the window, lifts the curtain slightly, then
turns back to the others.

                      GUY
              (continuing)
          My guardian angel.

The group move to look out the window, the senator with
reluctance.

LONG SHOT EXT. STREET FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

Through the window we see the figure of a man across the
street. He is lighting a cigarette and strolling up and
down.


BACK TO GROUP

                      BARBARA
              (impressed)
          You're being tailed!

                      GUY
              (turning to them)
          That's Leslie Hennessy. He works
          sixteen hours a day. Somebody else
          takes over for the next eight.
              (drops the curtain,
               turns back into room)
          As a matter of fact, Hennessy's a
          very nice fellow.

                      BARBARA
          Shouldn't we ask him in for Coffee --
          or something?

Nobody bothers to answer her. The Senator is disturbed, but
confident of his own prestige as he goes back to his coffee.

                      SENATOR
          I'll have him called off immediately
          of course.

              (calmly)
          I'm afraid where I go, Hennessy goes.
          Even to the Senate.

                      SENATOR
              (Pausing with his cup
               hallway to his mouth)
          Is he likely to -- picket my office?

                         GUY
          Very likely.

The Senator's cup is suddenly back on its saucer and he is
on his feet, pacing nervously.
                       SENATOR
          I would suggest, Guy, for your own
          peace of mind, of course, that you
          work here at the house for a few
          days.
               (a pause)
          It would be less embarrassing for
          you.

Guy has been looking at Anne and is concerned at the worry
on her face. He nods in assent to the Senator's suggestion,
but puts his hand over Anne's.

                      GUY
              (hopelessly)
          Then what about practicing? Perhaps
          I'd better forget Forest Hills?

                      SENATOR
          My dear boy, wouldn't it look rather --
          awkward -- if you suddenly canceled
          all your plans.

                      ANNE
          He's right, Guy. You mustn't do
          anything that would look suspicious.
          You've got to carry on as though
          nothing has happened.

                       BARBARA
              (pointing out the
               window)
          Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.

The are crestfallen again. RANDALL, the manservant, has
entered with the telephone.

                      RANDALL
          A call for you, Mr. Haines.   They
          say it is urgent.

The phone is plugged in to a connection and Guy crosses the
room and picks up the receiver. The Burtons watch him.

                      GUY
          Hello --


INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH BIG HEAD CLOSEUP OF BRUNO

His face wears the most affable expression.
                      BRUNO
          Hello, Guy. I tried your apartment,
          but --
              (pause)
          Why, Guy, this is Bruno!


INT. BURTON LIVING ROOM

Guy hangs up the telephone quickly.   He looks at the others,
awkwardly tries to explain:

                      GUY
          Must be some mistake.   It wasn't for
          me.

His embarrassment grows as Anne looks at him with a puzzled
expression.

FADE IN
EXT. WASHINGTON STREET APPROACHING JEFFERSONS MEMORIAL DAY

Guy and HENNESSY are walking along the street together, CAMERA
MOVING WITH THEM. Their relationship is most friendly. Guy
carries a briefcase. Hennessy is an amiable but not gullible
young man in his early thirties. He knows his job, is well
groomed, well educated, and well liked.

                      GUY
          Well, I suppose I was pretty lucky
          to be seeded fifth, really.

          forward to it.

                      GUY
              (wryly)
          Do you mean we'll be going there
          together, Hennessy?

                       HENNESSY
          Oh, don't worry. This thing will be
          cleared up by that time.
               (changes the subject)
          Ever thought of turning professional,
          Guy?

                      GUY
          I won't have to do that. When I'm
          through with tennis. I'll be going
          into politics, I hope.

                       HENNESSY
              (aghast)
          Politics! It's a good thing for you
          I don't report that to the chief.

He turns to light a cigarette. As he does, Guy gives a barely
perceptible start at what he sees offscene.


LONG SHOT JEFFERSON MEMORIAL FROM GUYS VIEWPOINT

The tiny figure of a man is standing at the base of the tall
white column. The figure lifts in arm and waves. Instinct
tells us that this is Bruno. Hennessy is still mumbling his
opinion of politics.

Guy turns his back on Bruno's figure and looks frantically
toward to street, wanting to get away.

            late.

He hails a taxi which is cruising by, and they start to get
in. Guy directs the driver.

                        GUY
            Pentagon Building, please.

                        HENNESSY

            lost.

INT. GUY'S APARTMENT NIGHT

As Guy comes in from outside, there is a note on   the floor
that has been pushed under the door. Guy picks    it up, stares
at it for a minute before he opens it. He takes    out a
handwritten note and reads it with an expression   of disgust.


INSERT NOTE (IN GUY'S HANDS)

IT READS:

Dear Guy:
We have to meet and make plans.
Call me at Arlington ----.
Time's getting short.
                       Bruno


The handwriting is sprawling and erratic, embellished with
conceited flourishes.

Guy looks off for a moment with set face, then tearing the

and holds it to the fragments, letting them burn and fall
into an ash tray.

INT. MELLON GALLERY

Guy and Anne are walking slowly through a more or less
deserted room of the gallery. Their manner is relaxed and
intimate.

                       ANNE
           Well, we'd better be getting back.

                       GUY
           We've actually been alone for an
           hour. Seems almost indecent. You
           like?

           How long can it go on?

                       GUY
           I don't know. I suppose until they
           find out who did it.

                       ANNE
           We'll be happier then, won't we?

                       GUY
           I suppose so.

Anne looks it him, surprised at his lack of enthusiasm.
They walk on out of the picture.

A figure steps out from behind a pillar in the main hall of
the gallery, near the spot from which they have disappeared.
It is Bruno. He calls.

                             BRUNO
                  (softly)
           Guy!

Anne stops and looks back. Guy knows who it is and would
not turn but that he is forced to by Anne's action. He takes
a few steps towards Bruno.

Anne watches Guy approach this stranger.   She looks downward
at Bruno's tie pin.

him, a little hurt.

FADE IN
INT. MORTON STUDY MED. SHOT

Guy and a secretary have set up office in the Morton study.
As the scene opens the secretary is handing Guy a large
envelope.

                      SECRETARY
          Here's a special delivery, Mr. Haines.
          It's marked personal.

As Guy is opening the envelope, Barbara speaks to him from
atop a library ladder. She is getting a book from one of
the top shelves of a bookcase, which is next to a window.
                      BARBARA
          Are you getting in any practice today,
          Guy?

                       GUY
              (as he takes out a
                large folded sheet
                of paper and glances
                at it, mystified)
          Yes, if I can get a court at the
          club.

As Guy's hands unfold the paper and hold it for moment, we
see that it is a diagrammed plan of the grounds and the
Interior of the Anthony house. There are dotted lines along
the upper hall, with an arrow which points to one room and
where Bruno has indicated in his handwriting, "My father's
room." Over this we hear the voices of Barbara and the
secretary:

                      SECRETARY'S VOICE
          Barbara, who are you waving at?

                       BARBARA'S VOICE
          Mr. Hennessy. I think it is a shame
          Daddy won't let us have him in the
          house to sit down. Have you met him
          yet, Louise?

                      SECRETARY'S VOICE
          No.

Her voice breaks his reverie.   He answers her with a forced
smile.

            No, thank you, Louise.

There are twenty or thirty people sitting in the bleacher
seats opposite the umpire's chair. A game of mixed doubles
is in progress.


MED. SHOT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE COURT

Guy appears, carrying his racquets. His partner for the
forthcoming game, and one or two other players, are close
by.


CLOSER SHOT

Guy looks about him. Several people are looking at him
awkwardly or avoiding his eyes. He moves self-consciously
away, and the CAMERA PANS HIM around the court to the umpire's
chair.

A couple of women players whisper something about Guy as he
goes past them.

MED. SHOT

As Guy stands at the umpire's chair, the umpire glances down
and gives him a rather embarrassed greeting.


CLOSEUP GUY
He looks across at the watching crowd.


MED. SHOT FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT

The heads of the people in the bleachers move from side to
side, to follow the play on the court. One head is not
moving. It is staring at Guy. It is Bruno.

At this moment, we hear the umpire calling, "Game, set and
match" to the winning mixed doubles pair.


CLOSEUP GUY

His expression becomes set.


LONG SHOT

The mixed doubles couples complete their handshaking at the
net and move off the court. We see Guy move up to the base
line while the other player takes his position for the
preliminary knock-up.


MED. SHOT

As Guy casually knocks the ball across the net, he glances
again toward Bruno.

He hears his opponent's voice.

Guy shakes off his abstraction and poises himself to receive
the ball.

short at what he sees:

The group at the table comprising Bruno, Anne and the two
French people. Bruno is preening himself as the others laugh
uproariously, obviously at something Bruno has said. Anne
catches sight of Guy and smiles at him.

            time, Mr. Haines. In fact, I follow

            Mr. Antony has been telling us such
            charming stories... Very funny.

CLOSEUP GUY

He gives another weak little smile.


MED. SHOT

In response to the Frenchwoman's attentive and eager
expression, Bruno leans forward on the table and starts saying
something more in extremely fluent French.


CLOSEUP ANNE

She is staring at Bruno with a new expression.


CLOSEUP FROM ANNE'S VIEWPOINT

Bruno's coat has spread open a bit, and his tie pin bearing
the name "Bruno" is resting on the edge of the table.


CLOSEUP ANNE

She becomes aware that this is the man she has seen call to
Guy in the art museum, that they have met before. Her eyes
turn a little in Guy's direction, though she does not look
at him.


CLOSEUP GUY

He is still watching Bruno talk to the French couple. Guy
is unaware of Anne's looks. Suddenly his attention is
arrested by the sound of Barbara's voice calling him.

              (very impressed)
          Guy, did you know Mr. Hennessy helped
          crack that axe murder I was reading
          about? You know, the one where the
          body was cut up and hidden in the
          butcher shop? He was locked in the
          ice box with the left leg for six
          hours!

          He pulls those yarns right out of
          his hat, Babs.

He gives a sharp look back toward Bruno. There is more
laughter coming from the French couple at the table.

Bruno is occupied with his French joke, but Anne is looking
at Guy strangely.

From Bruno's viewpoint, as Barbara speaks,CAMERA MOVES IN

fills the screen with the effect of whirling around Barbara's
head. Her glasses seem to glint until her eyes are
obliterated by the glare.

All talk dies out as all eyes turn to Bruno, who is staring
at Barbara. Except Anne's, who is saying quietly to Bruno:

FADE IN
INT. GUY'S APARTMENT NIGHT


CLOSEUP A LUGER PISTOL HELD IN GUY'S HANDS
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO SHOW Guy staring down at it. He is
partially dressed for an evening party, in black bow tie but
without his jacket. He leans forward to take up a letter
from among brown paper wrappings on the table.


INSERT: LETTER

               Dear Guy --

               Just two more days left. We must
               get together for final details.

The note, in Bruno's handwriting, is unsigned.


CLOSEUP GUY

He stares down at the note.   At this moment there is a knock
at the door.


MED. SHOT

Guy hastily gather together the gun, the note and the
wrappings and puts them in a dresser drawer. He crosses to
the door and opens it. Hennessy enters, carrying a topcoat.

                        GUY
            Hiya, Hennessy. Won't keep you out
            late tonight.
                (getting into his
                 dinner jacket)

               cigarette)
          That's too bad. Hammond takes over
          in a couple of hours. I'd like to
          see him earn his salary.

Guy turns to the dresser drawer in which he has put the note
and the gun, maneuvering his body between the dresser and
Hennessy's view. He takes out a handkerchief, closes the
drawer, sticks the handkerchief in his pocket, speaking as
he does so.

                      GUY
          Doesn't that bloodhound over relax?
          He sticks so close he's beginning to
          grow on me -- like a fungus.

          He thinks you're a very suspicious
          character. He doesn't trust anybody!
          Not even himself.

Guy is eager to get out of the room, and Hennessy is
maddeningly slow in his movements.

manner is somewhat preoccupied. She glances around as she
speaks, as though looking for someone.

We see Guy excuse himself from Barbara, cross to Bruno and
speak to him angrily, obviously asking, "What are you doing
here?" Bruno, however, greets Guy with a smile then turns
from him, unperturbed and bland. He sees Anne and moves
toward her, smiling.


CLOSEUP ANNE

As Bruno comes in her direction, Anne's expression shows her
mystification and concern about Bruno's presence and about
Guy's attitude toward him.


MED. SHOT
Bruno comes up to Anne and the Senator. He gives a slight
bow to the Senator; then puts his hand out to Anne.

                        BRUNO
            Good evening, Miss Burton.

The Senator looks inquiringly.    Anne makes the introduction.

                        ANNE
            This is Mr. Antony, father.

                        SENATOR
            How do you do, sir.

                        BRUNO
            I'd like to talk to you sometime,
            Senator, about my idea of harnessing
            the life force. It will make atomic
            power look like the horse and buggy.

            to smell a flower on the planet of
            Mars? I'd like to lunch with you
            some day soon and tell you more about
            it.

Interrupted by new arrivals, Bruno moves away out of the
picture, with a charming smile to Anne.

The Senator greets the new guests with open mouth and simply
shakes their hands while glancing off in direction of the
departing Bruno.

She realizes he hasn't heard a word she's said and haughtily
moves on. The Senator turns to Anne.

          sentenced a man to the chair, isn't
          it difficult to go and eat your dinner
          after that?

                      JUDGE
          Young man, when a murderer is caught,
          he must be tried. When he is
          convicted, he must be sentenced.
          When he is sentenced to death, he
          must be executed.

                      BRUNO
          Quite impersonal, isn't it, sir?

                     JUDGE
          So it is. Besides, it doesn't happen
          every day.

At this moment, Anne comes into the scene.    She hesitates as
she hears Bruno's answer.

                      BRUNO
          So few murderers are caught.

The Judge moves out of the way. Bruno smiles blandly at the
ladies. One of them speaks to him.

                      MRS. CUNNINGHAM
          Well, Mr. Antony, you seem very
          interested in the subject of murder.

Anne looks more troubled, then moves on out of the scene.

                      BRUNO
          No more than anyone else.   No more
          than you, for instance.

                       MRS. CUNNINGHAM
          Me?   I'm not interested in murder.

Bruno pulls up a chair to face the two woman on the settee,
sits down, straddling the seat, to look at them over the
back of the chair and settle down for a nice conversation.

    Oh, come now, everyone's interested
    in that. Everyone would like to put
    someone out of the way. Now surely,
    Madame, you're not going to tell me
    that there hasn't been a time when
    you wanted to dispose of someone.

          with a hammer, pour gasoline over
          him and over the car and start the
          whole thing ablaze.

                       BRUNO
              (looks at her
                deprecatingly)
          And then have to walk all that way
          home?

Mrs. Anderson laughs.

                      BRUNO
          No, I have the best way, and the
          best tools.
              (he holds out his
               hands and shows them)
          Simple, silent, and quick. The silent
          part being the most important. Let
          me show you what I mean.

                       BRUNO (CONT'D)
              (he raises his hands
               toward Mrs.
               Cunningham's throat,
               then stops a moment
               to ask)
          You don't mind if I borrow your neck
          for a moment do you?

                      MRS. CUNNINGHAM
              (giggles)
          Well, it's not for long.

                      BRUNO
          Oh!  no.
              (he takes a drink and
               puts his glass down)
          Now, when I nod my head, just see if
          you can cry out, and I bet you can't.
              (he places his hands
               around Mrs.
               Cunningham's neck)
          Now with my two thumbs...you see
          that's where I'll be able to prevent
          any sound coming from you. Now,
          just wait for the nod of my head.


CLOSEUP BRUNO

As he starts to Press her neck, his eyes wander from the
face of his "victim" to someone else off scene.


MED. SHOT BARBARA

She is watching this rather unorthodox demonstration. The
CAMERA MOVES UP until her head fills the screen. Her glasses
glint in the light.


CLOSEUP BRUNO

He is now transfixed. His breathing becomes heavy. A strange
expression comes over his face. He still stares off at
Barbara.


MED. SHOT BARBARA

We see the whirling merry-go-round spinning around her head.

BIG HEAD CLOSEUP BRUNO

He now seem to have almost gone into a trance. Over the
shot we begin to HEAR a strangled cry, and a broken
exclamation, then Mrs. Anderson's voice.

                         MRS. ANDERSON'S VOICE
          Mr. Antony!     Mr. Antony!

                       ANOTHER VOICE
          Stop him!   Stop him!


CLOSEUP
Bruno's wrists and hands and the neck of his victim. We can
just see Mrs. Cunningham's chin at the top of the screen.
Her head is tossing from side to side. Her hands are
clutching at Bruno's wrists. The hands of the other two
women, also in the picture, are pulling at Bruno's wrists.
Mrs. Cunningham's hands begin to slide off. Her head drops
back.

Over this we HEAR cries of:

                      VOICES
          Stop him!
          Help, somebody!
          Pull him off!
          Mr. Antony! Mr. Antony!


CLOSEUP BRUNO

His body is swaying slightly at the various efforts to drag
him away from Mrs. Cunningham. His eyes begin to close, and
slowly he falls away from the picture in a dead faint on the
floor.


MEDIUM SHOT

There is a rush of people around Mrs. Cunningham, who is
breathing frantically, her eyes opening and closing. A couple
of women are feebly slapping her hands, someone else is
fanning her face.


MEDIUM SHOT

The Senator and Guy rush into the picture. They look at the
fallen Bruno. They search around for an explanation. Other
man come in ad they start to pick Bruno up.

                         GUY
             Bring him this way.

Guy gives a quick look in direction of Mrs. Cunningham, sees
that she is being attended to.


MEDIUM SHOT

Anne rushes into the picture. She sees Bruno being helped
to his feet; then turns her attention to Mrs. Cunningham,
who has now somewhat recovered. Mrs. Cunningham is helped
to the settee. There is a babble of women's voices trying
to explain what has happened.
                         ANNE
                 (thru the babble)
             Bring her upstairs.

As the two groups pass off in different directions, the few
people who ran into the scene late are asking the others
what the disturbance is. "What's wrong?" "Did she faint?"
"I didn't see anything." "What happened to him?" "Somebody
hurt?" But one small figure stands in the clear. It is
Barbara, She is still transfixed by what she has seen. Her
hands are trembling. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON HER. We see
that her lips are trembling, too, and in her eyes frightened
tears are welling. Her breath is heavy.


INT. STUDY

Bruno is stretched out on a settee. He is completely out.
His collar and tie are open. Two or three of the male guests
are just leaving the room. The Senator remains behind for a
moment with Guy.

                         SENATOR
             I thought he was a bit weird when he
             arrived. Who is he?

                         GUY
             I hardly know him, sir.

                         SENATOR
             Get him out of here as soon as you
             decently can -- will you. This is a
             nice item for the gossips. First
             thing you know, they'll be talking
             about orgies. I'd better get back...

                         GUY
             Yes, sir.

The Senator leaves.   Guy stands over Bruno's outstretched
figure.


MEDIUM SHOT

Bruno is now half awake. Almost without seeing Guy, he
staggers to his feet and begins to make his way to the door.
Guy advances, and with a sharp thrust, pushes Bruno back on
the settee.

Bruno looks and sees Guy clearly for the first time.

                      BRUNO
          What happened? I was on a merry-go-
          round somewhere. It made me dizzy.

Guy moves forward, and thrusting his hand in Bruno's open
shirt, pulls him to his feet. Bruno ignores Guy's violence
and remain puzzled.

                      GUY
              (disgusted)
          You're a mad, crazy maniac, and you
          ought to be locked-up! Now will you
          get out of here and let me alone?

                        BRUNO
          But, Guy --

Guy smashes Bruno in the jaw, in utter disgust, and knocks
him back onto the settee. Bruno looks up from his sprawled
position, a dull look in his eye.

                      BRUNO
          You shouldn't have done that, Guy.

                      GUY
              (subsiding)
          Come on -- pull yourself together.
          Do your tie up.

Bruno staggers to his feet. He fumbles at his collar.    As
he crosses to him, CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSER SHOT.

                      GUY
          Here -- let me.

He fixes Bruno's shirt and collar together and quickly ties
his white bow. Bruno stands swaying like a small boy as Guy
does this.

They pass trough door into the hallway.

across to the front door.


CLOSE SHOT

Barbara appears in the hallway, coming from the crowded
sitting room. She watches the two men go out the front door.


MEDIUM SHOT

Bruno and Guy going out the front door. The man-servant
does not close it immediately, so we are able to HEAR the
call for Mr. Antony's car.

She turns her head and looks up the stairs. Barbara has not
quite recovered from her ordeal. She hurries forward to
greet Anne who is hurrying down the stairs.

CAMERA PANS DOWN with Anne as she descends the last few steps.
Barbara enters the picture and the two girls meet at the
foot of the stairs.

                       BARBARA
           He was looking at her first. Then
           he looked over at me. He went into
           a sort of trance
               (shudders)
           He looked horrible!
               (reflectively)

           Anne, why me? Why me?   What did I
           have to do with it?

Anne is extremely concerned and thoughtful. Suddenly she
gets an idea and with a pat on Barbara's arm, asks hurriedly:

                       ANNE
           Do you know where Guy is?

                       BARBARA

Anne hurries to the front door and passes through.

EXT. HOUSE

Anne comes out onto the steps and looks around.   She stops
short as she sees:


LONG SHOT EXT. STREET FROM ANNE'S VIEWPOINT

There are cars lined up outside on the street. One limousine
is pulling up in the center, two figures at the passenger
door. One is climbing in. The other is Guy.

She calls out urgently:

                         ANNE

Guy turns and closes the door.

She leads him along a few paces and then stops and faces
him.

Anne nods off in the direction of the departed Bruno and
speaks in a desperate, low voice.

                         ANNE
             You didn't meet him for the first
             time the other day, did you, Guy?

Guy stares at her for a moment.

                         GUY
             You mean when you introduced us at
             the club?

          Yes. Did you notice how he stared
          at Barbara that day?

                      GUY
              (awkwardly)
          Well, I didn't -- particularly --

                      ANNE
              (breaks in)
          He stared at her again tonight --
          while his hands were around Mrs.
          Cunningham's throat.

Guy looks at Anne with an expression of growing fear and
alarm. She goes on inexorably:

                      ANNE
          What did Miriam look like, Guy.

                      GUY
              (awkwardly)
          Well, why do you ask me? You've
          seen her pictures in the paper.

                      ANNE
          Go on, I want you to tell me.

                      GUY
              (haltingly)
          Well, she was dark, not too tall,
          rather pretty --

                       ANNE
          What else?

                      GUY
          What else is there?

                      ANNE
          She wore glasses, didn't she?

                       GUY
          Yes.

                      ANNE
          She looked a lot like Barbara, didn't
          she?

Guy suddenly begins to realize what Anne is getting at.

Anne lowers her head, deliberately avoids looking at Guy, as
she asks:

                GUY
    Yes.
        (suddenly bursting
         out)
    He's a maniac. I met him on the
    train going to Metcalf. He had a
    crazy scheme about exchanging murders.
    I do his murder and he do mine.

                 ANNE
         (quietly)
    What do you mean -- your murder,
    Guy?

                GUY
    Well, he'd read about me in the paper.
    He knew about Miriam -- and about
    you. He suggested that  if he got
    rid of Miriam for me, I should kill
    his father.

                ANNE
    You must have realized he was talking
    a lot of nonsense!

                GUY
    Of course! I didn't give it another
    thought. And now a lunatic wants me
    to kill his father.

          And have them say what you did --
          "Mr. Haines, how did you get him to
          do it?" And Bruno would say we'd
          planed it together.

                      ANNE
          Oh, Guy -- what can we do?

                      GUY

TWO SHOT ACROSS THE STREET

As Hennessy watches Anne and Guy go toward the house, his
relief, HAMMOND, comes up. Hammond's a zealous, hard-eyed
sleuth.

              (a little glum)
          Hello, Hammond.

                      HAMMOND
          You look worried. What's the matter?

                      HENNESSY
          You'd better keep on your toes.
          Something funny's going on.

INT. GUY'S APARTMENT LATER THAT NIGHT

Still in his dinner clothes, Guy is seated in deep thought
near the telephone, wrestling with his problem. There is an
open telephone directory in front of him. He comes to a
decision, picks up the telephone and dials a number. He
waits for the answer, then:

                      GUY
          Bruno? Yes, yes, it's Guy...I've
          decided to do what you want. I'll
          make that little visit to father....
              (listens a moment)
          Tonight.
              (listens another moment)
          Yes, I want to get this thing over
          with, can you leave the house again,
          Bruno?
              (pause)
          You'd better stay out till daylight.

Guy hangs up, rises and starts to move with purpose for his
night's activities.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


INT. GUY'S APARTMENT NIGHT

Guy is sitting at the table. He is dressed differently,
having changed from his dinner clothes to a sack suit. There
is only one lamp lighted in the room. Guy presents a grim
picture.

He is studying the plan of Bruno's house, and he picks up
the key Bruno sent along with it.  Finally he looks at his
watch, then folds the plan and puts it in his pocket with
the key. He rises, crosses to the  chest of drawers, opens
the top drawer.


INSERT: THE OPEN DRAWER

Guy's hands take out the Luger. His hand then picks up
Miriam's glasses from the drawer, holds them a moment. He
is about to put them back, then decides to take them along,
puts them into his pocket.

quietly and moves away to a window at the turn of the stairs.


EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

Guy comes out of the window onto the second floor fire escape.
He creeps stealthily down and emerges into a narrow alleyway.
He steps back into the shadows for a moment when he sees:

EXT. A TALL PAIR OF ELABORATE IRON GATES NIGHT

We are on the inside of the gates. We see them swing open
slightly and the figure of Guy edges through them.


CLOSE SHOT
Guy leaves the gates ajar and then, taking the plan of Bruno's
house from his pocket, and the key, he looks toward the house.


EXT. STEPS LONG SHOT NIGHT

This is a long flight of steps. Moonlit. They are lined
with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across
the steps. Guy moves out of one shadow, into another and
carefully starts up the stairs.


AT THE DOOR

He pauses, looks about for a moment and listens. Then he
puts the key into the lock, finding it with his flashlight.
The door opens a few inches. He turns off the flash, and
enters.

toward the stairs which are in shadow.

Guy starts up the stairs slowly.   He carries his flashlight
and the plan.


AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS THE DOG

A huge shadow lies it the head of the stairs. As Guy comes
slowly up the stairs, the Great Dane looks down at him.

GUY ON THE STAIRS

He reacts to the sight of the dog, stops an instant, and
turn on his flashlight. The heavy massive face of the dog
looks straight down at him. Guy turns off the flashlight
and after a moment of indecision starts slowly up the stairs
once more, the dog watching every step he takes.


UPPER HALLWAY

Guy comes up the last few stairs and still the dog hasn't
moved. Guy slowly edges past him and the Great Dane's head
turns to watch him.

GUY

moving quietly along the hallway, approaches two doors. He
takes out his flash and identifies the door with his plan.


INSERT:

The plan shows two doors in relation to the stairway. The
first one is clearly marked: "MY room." The adjoining door
is marked: "My FATHER'S room."


CLOSE SHOT GUY

He pauses at the first door, then passes it quietly, walking
on to the next one. He turns the knob soundlessly and passes
through into the room.


INT. ANTONY BEDROOM LONG SHOT

The room is in darkness except for the dim outline of the
recumbent figure in the bed. We hear Guy's voice, in a loud
whisper:

                        GUY
          Mr. Antony!

The figure stirs.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Guy takes a stop closer to the bed.

                        GUY
                (urgently)
            Mr. Antony! Don't be alarmed -- but
            I must talk to you about your son.
            About Bruno. Mr. Antony!

The figure on the bed turns and a hand stretches out toward
a bedside light. The light goes on with a sudden glare.


CLOSEUP FACE OF BRUNO IN THE LIGHT (LOW CAMERA)

The low CAMERA throws a vast shadow up on the wall behind
him, creating a grimace of his smile.
                        BRUNO
            Yes, Mr. Haines?


CLOSEUP GUY

His face is dead.


MED. SHOT

Bruno rises from the bed and sits on the and of it. He is
fully dressed, just as he was at the party, in white tie and
tails.

                        BRUNO
                (politely)
            My father isn't home tonight, Mr.
            Haines.
                (smiles grimly at
                 Guy's surprise)
            I was about to tell you that over
            the phone. But you came to such a
            sudden decision. I wondered why.

                        GUY
                (recovering quickly)
            Since you sent me a key to your house,
            I decided to use it -- to make a
            little social call on your father.
            I thought he'd be Interested to know
            he his a lunatic son.

The faintest flicker of Bruno's eyes indicates the intensity
of his reaction. He stares hard at Guy.

                       BRUNO
           Then a I correct, Mr. Haines, in
           assuming that you have no intention
           of going ahead with our arrangement?

                       GUY
           No intention whatsoever.      I never
           had.

                       BRUNO
           I see. You won't have any further
           use for the key, then, Mr. Haines.
               (he holds out his
                hand and Guy gives
                him the key)
           Thank you very such.

As Bruno continues to stare at him, Guy takes out the Luger.
For a moment a look of fear comes into Bruno's face as he
thinks Guy will probably shoot him. After a pause, Guy tosses
the gun on the bed.

                       GUY
           Or this.

Bruno's relief turns again to menace.      He picks up the gun
and fingers it nervously.

                        GUY
               (kindly)
           Look, Bruno. You're terribly sick.
               (haltingly)
           I don't know whether it's possible
           for you to realize it or not. I
           don't know much about these things,
           Bruno. But why don't you go someplace
           where you can get some treatment?
           Not only for your own sake, Bruno,
           but you can't go on causing more and
           more destruction to anyone you happen
           to meet.

Bruno pays no attention.     He rises.


TWO SHOT

Guy's arguments have made no impression on Bruno whatsoever.
He fingers the gun.

                       BRUNO
           I don't like to be doublecrossed.

                        BRUNO (CONT'D)
            I have a murder on my conscience,
            but it's not my murder, Mr. Haines --
            it's yours. And as you're the one
            to profit, I think you should be the
            one to pay for it.

For an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with
the urge to kill Guy.

                        GUY
                (gives up)
            Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno.
            We sees to have nothing further to
            discuss.
Bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it
for Guy to pass through.


INT. HALLWAY MED. SHOT

Guy walks toward the stairs, tense and apprehensive. Bruno
is following him, still holding the gun. When the Great
Dane sees Bruno it gets to its feet, as if waiting for a
command.

Guy starts down the stairs but Bruno stays where he is, the
dog beside him. Gay turns and looks back it this tableaux
of menace.

                        BRUNO
            Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot
            you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb
            mother.
                (with a feeling of
                 power)
            I'm a very clever follow. I'll think
            of something better than that. Much
            better.


LONG SHOT

Bruno remains in the foreground of the scene as Guy proceeds
on down the stairs. We see him open the front door and pass
through.

EXT. STREET ACROSS GUY'S APARTMENT EARLY
CLOSE SHOT HENNESSY AND HAMMOND MORNING

Hennessy is relieving Hammond who has kept watch on Guy's
apartment night.

                      HAMMOND
              (in the middle of his
               story)
          He came back at three twenty-five.
          I didn't even know he'd given me the
          slip until his 'phone kept ringing
          for about half an hour. Nobody sleeps
          that sound. So I got the janitor to
          let me in. No Haines.
                      HENNESSY
              (to himself)
          Wonder where he went?

                      HAMMOND
          We'll probably hear of another dame
          murdered.

                      HENNESSY
              (puzzled)
          Shut up. I'd better contact Metcalf.
          I should think this calls for more
          questioning of Mr. Haines.

                         HAMMOND
          Questioning?     Nuts!   Let's take him
          in.

                      HENNESSY
          My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times
          do I have to tell you that we have
          nothing conclusive on Haines? There's
          no evidence that he was ever at the
          scene of the crime. Can't you get
          that into your thick head?
              (quietly)
          Now stay put till I get back.

As he starts away --

                                                    FADE OUT.

FADE IN
INT. ANTONY LIVING ROOM LATE MORNING

Anne and Mrs. Antony are in the middle of a conversation.
Anne's manner is tense and purposeful, Mrs. Antony's much
less serious.

                       MRS. ANTONY
          Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I
          know Bruno's been in some very awkward
          scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous
          as a murder.
              (she gives a short
               little laugh)
                      ANNE
              (desperately)
          But, Mrs. Antony, you've got to make
          him do something about this. Don't
          you see that just one word from him
          would extricate Guy from this dreadful
          situation?

                       MRS. ANTONY
               (lightly)
          Oh, but Miss Burton, I'm sure this
          thing must be some practical joke.
          You know, Bruno sometimes goes too
          far.
               (girl to girl)
          Of course I shouldn't be saying this
          to an outsider, but sometimes he's
          terribly irresponsible and gets into
          all kinds of escapades.

                      ANNE
          But don't you understand, Mrs. Antony --
          your son is responsible for a woman's
          death.

                      MRS. ANTONY
              (drawing herself up
               with some hauteur)
          Did Bruno tell you this?

                      ANNE
          Of course not, Mrs. Antony.

                      MRS. ANTONY
              (that settles it)
          Well, there you are.

              (she sighs and rises,
               winding it up)
          Well, Miss Burton, it was very nice
          of you to call. You must excuse me
          now. I must get back to my painting.
          Do you care for painting, Miss Burton?
          I find it so soothing.
              (shakes Anne's hand)
          You must come again sometime.

She goes out. Anne is left helpless, standing in the middle
of the room. She picks up her purse and is about to go when
she hears a voice:
                      BRUNO'S VOICE
          Oh, Miss Burton!

Anne turns back in direction of the voice. CAMERA   PULLS
BACK until we can see the feet of Bruno protruding  from behind
a chair in which he is sitting. He has obviously   heard the
entire conversation between Anne and his mother.   Bruno rises.
He is in dressing gown and pajamas.

                       BRUNO
          I'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful,
          was she?
              (he strolls toward
               Anne)
          You know she hasn't been well for a
          long time. She's a little -- how
          shall I say -- confused.
              (shakes his head
               commiseratingly)
          Poor mother.

Anne is too stunned to speak.

                      BRUNO
          You know, I'm very upset with Guy.
          He shouldn't have sent you on an
          errand like this.

                      ANNE
          Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony.

                      BRUNO
          He's been leading you up the garden
          path, I'm afraid. He must be very
          desperate to try to involve me.
          I've been protecting him ever since
          we had that conversation on the train
          and he told me how he hated his wife.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                103.



Bruno is now standing near the   window a little apart from
Anne, with his back to him. He    takes something out of the
pocket of his dressing gown and   looks down at it in his hand.
It is Guy's lighter.  Suddenly   he stuffs it back his pocket
and turn back to Anne.

                      BRUNO
          Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he
          tried to get me to go back to the
          island one night after dark and pick
          up his lighter so the police wouldn't
          find it? He dropped it there, you
          know, when -- well, that night.

Anne's horror is growing.
                      BRUNO
          The whole thing's been worrying me
          so much. But of course I couldn't
          do it, Miss Burton. It would have
          been too risky. And besides, it
          would have made me an accessory.

Anne stares at this insane man and sinks on the settee.   She
starts to cry in sheer frustration. Bruno goes to her
sympathetically.

                      BRUNO
          Miss Burton, I know how you feel.

He puts his hand on her shoulder. Anne flings it off. There
is an awkward pause as Bruno looks down at her. Then he
begins to look around restlessly.

                      BRUNO
          Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I
          have an urgent appointment.
              (looks it his watch)
          I must go up and change. Now, I
          really must go...if you'll excuse
          me...

He turns, starts out of the room and up the stairs in the
hall. Anne watches him.


STAIRWAY FROM ANNE'S VIEWPOINT

Bruno turns and waves to Anne from the landing, then goes on
up the stairs.

               (grimly)

           get it back means he's going to put

          Hennessy the slip after the match.

              (getting a thought)
          Didn't Bruno say that I wanted him
          together there one night after dark?

                       ANNE
          Yes.

                      GUY
          Well, that's what's in his mind now.
          He's not going to expose himself in
          broad daylight, If I can finish off
          this match in three sets, I'll still
          get there in time.

REYNOLDS, Guy's opponent, enters scene behind Guy's chair.

Anne acknowledges his greeting with a nod.

through the window of his booth.

                      ANNOUNCER
          --It looks like an interesting match
          with Haines constantly charging the
          net -- not like Haines at all -- to
          press so early in the game...


MED. SHOT TEN COURT

Guy and his opponent, Reynolds, in play.   Guy scores a point.

CLOSEUP THE UMPIRE

He announces game to Haines.


MED. LONG SHOT

We see the two men change ends and come toward the Umpiri's
chair. Reynolds stops to take a drink of water. Guy, with
an impatient glance at him, moves over to the passing line
and waits, the CAMERA going with him.


EXT. WASHINGTON STREET

A taxicab is seen coming along.


MED. SHOT INSIDE CAB (PROCESS)

Bruno is sitting with in unlighted cigarette in his mouth.
CAMERA MOVES IN until he is in big CLOSEUP. His eyes look
down.  There is the SOUND of a click, then, Guy's lighter
comes up into the picture held against the cigarette.

Grouped.    A game is in progress.


MED. SHOT

A terrace where people get refreshments.       There are various
tables with umbrellas.


MED. SHOT AT ONE OF TABLE (PROCESS)

Guy is seated. He has his rackets with him and is waiting
his turn to start his match. An official is talking to him
but Guy keeps looking around as if expecting someone.

                        OFFICIAL
            Well, at least there'd be a trip to
            Australia, if you made it.

                        GUY
                (absently)
            We'll know more about that by the
            end of the week...
                (his face brightens
                 as he sees Anne)

Anne hurries in, nods briefly to the official who has started
to leave, and sits down.

                        OFFICIAL
            They're close to the finish, Guy

                        GUY
            Be right there.
                (turns to Anne)
            I was afraid you wouldn't get here.
            Wish me luck, darling.

He makes a move as if to follow official toward the stadium,
but Anne puts hand on his arm.

                        ANNE
                (quickly and urgently)
            Guy, listen to me, If I sound all
            mixed up I can't help it. I -- I'm
            scared.

                          GUY
            What about?

                      ANNE
          That's just it. I don't know. It's
          Bruno. I talked to him, Guy --

Guy stares at her, takes a quick look toward the stadium,
then gives Anne his full attention.

                      ANNE
          He acted peculiar -- as if he could
          put the murder right in your lap,
          and not involve himself at all.

                      GUY
              (shaking his head)
          He'd drag himself into it, -- and
          Bruno loves Bruno. I'm all right so
          long as he thinks I have an alibi
          for that night.
              (noticing the stricken
               look on Anne is face)
          He knows?

Anne nods slowly.

                       GUY
              (grimly)
          Then he'll think of something.   He
          said he would.

                      ANNE
          Guy, has he anything that the police
          could trace to you --
              (quoting Bruno)
          Any little thing.

                      GUY
          My cigarette lighter. He said once
          he could have left it on the islands
          as evidence
              (a pause)
          But he wouldn't do that. Not in
          broad day light.

                      ANNE
              (trying to think)
          But he's going somewhere, Guy.   He
          told his mother --

                      GUY
              (tensely)
          Metcalf -- did he say Metcalf?

                      ANNE
          No, -- I don't think so. Oh, why
          can't I remember -- he said such
          crazy things!

                      GUY
              (tensely)
          Try to think, Anne!

                      VOICE
              (OFFSCENE)
          Guy Haines! -- Reynolds!

While Anne is frantically trying to remember, Guy turns
toward, the stadium and gives a signal of "Be right there."
                      ANNE
          Something about the moon -- he said
          he had an appointment with the moon.

Guy's shoulders droop with disappointment.

                      GUY
          That's no help. But I can't take
          any chances. I've got to get that
          lighter -- somehow.

REYNOLDS, Guy's opponent, ENTERS SCENE behind Guy's chair.

                       REYNOLDS
          Okay, Guy.   We're on.

He walks away.   Anne and Guy rise, following him.

                      GUY
          I'll have to default.

                      ANNE
          And have Hennessy and that other one
          right at your heels?

Guy's expression says she's right, as they walk toward the
stadium.


ENTRANCE TO COVERED STAND

Hennessy and Hammond, the two detectives, are standing by.

                      HAMMOND

          to play tennis before I nabbed him!

                      HENNESSY
          We got our orders. We take him in --
          after the match.

Guy and Anne come INTO THE SCENE just as the players from
the previous match emerge. They pass through, nodding to
Hennessy.

                      HENNESSY
              (a little sadly)
          Good luck, Guy!
Guy gives him a thank-you nod. Hammond rolls his eyes in
disgust at Hennessy's politeness.


INSIDE THE STAND MED. SHOT

Anne is about to turn to her box but she is reluctant to
leave Guy, who must now join his opponent, Reynolds. As
their eyes hold, in mutual helplessness, Guy suddenly stares
at her with realization.

                      GUY
          The moon! You said he had an
          appointment --

Anne looks puzzled as Guy looks up at the sun, then at his
watch.

                      GUY
          Then he is going to Metcalf. But he
          has to wait until it gets dark --
              (with frantic haste,
               he thinks quickly,
               then murmurs to Anne)
          Listen, Anne, as soon as the third
          set starts, tell Barbara --

            with Haines out to blast Reynolds

Bruno is casually waiting for the train.   He stands near a

INSERT:

We see that the paper is open at the sports page. There is
a picture of Guy among other tennis players. WITH A DISSOLVE
the whole character of this page changes with the exception
of Guy's picture, which becomes surrounded with large type,
announcing the arrest of Guy Haines for the murder of his
wife Miriam. A sub-heading tells of Guy's cigarette lighter
found at the scene of the crime. All this DISSOLVES AWAY

passenger next to him asks:

             May I have a light, please?

Bruno looks at him for a moment and then at the lighter.
With great deliberation he puts the lighter away in his pocket
and takes out book-matches. Lighting a match, he holds it
to his fellow passenger's cigarette.

nearest horse. The momentum of the machine swings Guy around
against the horse, whose big head towers in the f.g. Bruno,
on this side of the horse pushes forward and tries to grab
the reins from Guy's hand. He tries to slash at Guy's face.
The back of Bruno's head is toward us during this. Guy
suddenly leans out across the horse and smashes his fist
against Bruno's face. Bruno's head goes back until it is in
the f.g. in a upside-down position.

enjoyment. He sees this by suddenly glancing over his
shoulder. In the b.g. Guy and Bruno are continuing their

leaps upon Guy. The two men sway toward the CAMERA until
Bruno gets alongside the little boy. The boy now shows some
anxiety. The three figures now fill the screen with the
horses' heads in the f.g. Bruno is forced against the little
boy, who now, alarmed, beats Bruno on the cheek with one
hand, the other holding onto the brass rail in front. Bruno
stops and with a sweep of his arm, knocks the little boy off
the horse onto the floor below. The little boy, in falling,
grabs the horse's rein or stirrup.

Guy breaks away from Bruno and dives around the back of the

          It's the other one -- the one he was
          fighting with.

                        TURLEY
                (stops to give his
                 full attention to
                 this unexpected bit
                 of information)
          What   do you mean, this isn't the --
                (turns to Guy, not
                 quite taking it in)
          Not   Haines?
                (back to boatman)
          But   you said he was. You pointed
          him   out.

                      BOATMAN
          No, I didn't, sir. I've never seen
          this man before in my life. I meant
          the other one.

The detective who was holding Guy instinctively relax his
hold on Guy's arm. Turley turns to Guy, puzzled.

                      TURLEY
          What is this all about, Haines?        Did
          you know he killed your wife?

                      GUY
              (nods)
          He has my cigarette   lighter and wanted
          to plant it there on   the island to
          pin the whole thing   on me.
              (urgently)
          Let me talk to him.      Let me show
          you. Where is he?

                        ANOTHER DETECTIVE
          Over here.

He leads the way.   They follow.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

as Guy and Turley enter to the  spot where Bruno is pinned
under the overturned machine.   He is caught between two of
the horses, the head of one of  them across his chest. Bruno's
head sags back somewhat, but is  resting on pieces of debris.
A uniformed policeman looks up  from Bruno to Turley:

                      POLICEMAN
          This one's in a pretty bad way, Mr.
          Turley.

Guy is shocked at the sight of Bruno.

                      GUY
              (looking down at Bruno)
          Can't you get that stuff off him?

                      POLICEMAN
          No, they've done everything they can
          until the crane comes.

Bruno opens his eyes and sees Guy.

                        BRUNO
          Hello, Guy.

Turley has leaned forward to look at the helpless Bruno.

                       BRUNO
              (weakly nodding at
               Turley)
          Who's that?

                      GUY
          This is Mr. Turley, Chief of Police.

                      BRUNO
              (with a half smile)
          So they got you at last, eh, Guy?

Guy looks around desperately, frustrated for a moment as
Turley eyes him stonily. Then he turns again to Bruno.

                      GUY
              (rather gently)
          Can you talk a little? Can you tell
          the chief you have my lighter?

                      BRUNO
              (with a faint,
               quizzical smile)
          I haven't got it. It's still on the
          island where you left it.

Guy looks around helplessly to Turley, who looks back at him
suspiciously.

                      DETECTIVE
              (looking down at Bruno)
          I think he's going.

Turley leans over to look.

CLOSE SHOT BRUNO'S FIST FROM TURLEY'S VIEWPOINT

As Bruno is dying, his closed fist slowly starts to open.

                      DETECTIVE'S VOICE
          He's finished.

Guy's lighter is now revealed in Bruno's open hand.


MED. SHOT GROUP

Turley takes the lighter from the dead Bruno's hand. Guy is
watching him. Turley straightens up and holds the lighter
out to him.

                      TURLEY
          Is this your lighter, Haines?

Guy nods without speaking, and with a half look in Bruno's
direction.

                      TURLEY
          Well, you were right.
              (sticks the lighter
               into his own pocket)
          I'd better keep this for the time
          being.
              (in a friendly tone)
          We can clear the whole thing out the
          morning. How about staying in town
          over night, Haines? I imagine you
          have a lot to tell me. Nine o'clock,
          all right?

                      GUY
              (nods)
          Okay, Mr. Turley.   Thanks.

Turley turns back to the group around Bruno. Guy looks down
for a moment at Bruno, then speaks to the boatman, who is
standing nearby.

                      GUY
          Can you tell me where there's a
          telephone?

                      BOATMAN
              (indicating)
          There's one up near the entrance.
              (with a look back to
               the dead Bruno)
          Who was he, Bud?

Guy looks back sympathetically in Bruno's direction, speaks
without looking at the boatman.

                      GUY
          Bruno. Bruno Antony.
              (reminiscently and a
               little
               compassionately,
               remembering what
               Bruno had said of
               himself)
          A very clever fellow.

He moves off through the crowd.

INT. BURTON STUDY NIGHT

Anne, Barbara and the Senator are sitting silently in the
attitudes of waiting. The telephone rings. Anne is instantly
on her feet. Barbara and the Senator watch her anxiously as
she goes to answer it.

          Yes, darling, yes. Of course I'll
          be there...Goodbye.

She hangs up, turns slowly, to face Barbara and her father.
Her expression is one of intense relief.

                      ANNE
          Guy'll be back tomorrow.
              (overcome with emotion
               she has difficulty
               in speaking)
          He wants me to take him some things.

With a sob, Barbara flings herself into Anne's arms. As she
cries, Anne strokes her head comfortingly. Then with a half-
choked sobs Anne, too, begins to cry. She speaks through
her tears, looking over Barbara's shoulder at her father.

                      ANNE
          He says he looks silly in his tennis
          clothes.

The Senator eyes them a moment, then speaks a little wryly:

                      SENATOR
          I presume from all those tears that
          you have had good news.

INT. PARLOR OF TRAIN NEXT DAY

Anne and Guy are sitting quietly together. Opposite them is
a man in a clerical collar who is reading a sports magazine.
On the cover is a picture of a tennis player in action. The
man looks over the top of his magazine at Guy, with
recognition. He leans forward.

                      CLERIC
          I beg your pardon, but aren't you
          Guy Haines?

                         GUY

          Yes.

Guy and Anne exchange a  brief look, rise hurriedly and start
to walk away before the  conversation can go any farther.
The cleric looks after  them with a frown and a puzzled shrug
of his shoulders, as if  to say, "Did I  say something wrong?"

          SUNSET BOULEVARD, stencilled on a curbstope.
          In the gutter lie dead leaves, scraps of paper,
          burnt matches and cigarette butts.  It is early
          morning.

          Now the CAMERA leaves the sign and MOVES EAST, the
          grey asphalt of the street filling the screen.  As
          speed accelerates to around 40 m.p.h., traffic de-

          It is a one-room affair with an unmade Murphy bed
          pulled out of the wall at which Gillis sits typing.
          There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs and a
          Spanish-style, wrought-iron standing lamp.  Also a
          small desk littered with books and letters, and a
          chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some
          records on top.  On the walls are a couple of repro-
          ductions of characterless paintings, with laundry
          bills and snapshots stuck in the frames.  Through an
          archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette, complete with
          unwashed coffee pot and cup, empty tin cans, orange
          peels, etc.  The effect is dingy and cheerless --
          just another furnished apartment.  The buzzer SOUNDS.

                 Yeah.

          The buzzer SOUNDS again.  Gillis gets up and opens
          the door.  Two men wearing hats stand outside one of

  A-11    SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE

          It is in the style of a Paramount executive's office --
          mahogany, leather, and a little chintz.  On the
          walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount
          stars, with dedications to Mr. Sheldrake.  Also a
          couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an
          Oscar on a bookshelf.  A shooting schedule chart is
          thumb-tacked into a large bulletin board.  There are
          piles or scripts, a few pipes and, somewhere in the
          background, some set models.

          Start on Sheldrake.  He is about 45.  Behind his wor-
          ried face there hides a coated tongue.  He is en-
          gaged in changing the stained rilter cigarette in
          his Zeus holder.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 All right, Gillis.  You've got
                 five minutes.  What's your story
                 about?

                            GILLIS
                 It's about a ball player, a rookie
                 shortstop that's batting 347.  The
                 poor kid was once mixed up in a hold-
                 up.  But he's trying to go straight --
                 except there's a bunch of gamblers
                 who won't let him.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 So they tell the kid to throw the
                 World Series, or else, huh?

                            GILLIS
                 More or less.  Only for the end
                 I've got a gimmick that's real good.

          A secretary enters, carrying a glass or milk.
          She opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for
          Sheldrake.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Got a title?

                 Get the Readers' Department and
                 see what they have on Bases Loaded.

          The secretary exits.  Sheldrake takes a pill and
          washes it down with some milk.

                            GILLIS
                 They're pretty hot about it
                 over at Twentieth, but I
                 think Zanuck's all wet.  Can

                 it's pretty simple to shoot.  Lot
                 of outdoor stuff.  Bet you could
                 make the whole thing for under a
                 million.  And there's a great little
                 part for Bill Demarest.  One of the
                 trainers, an oldtime player who
                 got beaned and goes out of his head
                 sometimes.

          The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean-
          cut, nice looking girl of 21, with a bright, alert
          manner.  Dressed in tweed skirt, Brooks sweater and
          pearls, and carrying a folder of papers.  She puts
          them on Sheldrake's desk, not noticing Gillis, who
          stands near the door.

                            BETTY
                 Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases
                 Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page

                      (She holds it out)
                 But I wouldn't bother.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 What's wrong with it?

                            BETTY
                 It's from hunger.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Nothing for Ladd?

                            BETTY
                 Just a rehash of something that
                 wasn't very good to begin with.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 I'm sure you'll be glad to meet
                 Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.

          Betty turns towards Gillis, embarrassed.

                            SHELDRAKE

                 I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I
                 just don't think it's any good.
                 I found it flat and banal.

                            GILLIS
                 Exactly what kind of material do
                 you recommend?  James Joyce?
                 Dostoosvsky?

                 I just think pictures should say
                 a little something.

                            GILLIS
                 Oh, you're one of the message
                 kids.  Just a story won't do.
                 You'd have turned down Gone With the
                 Wind.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 No, that was me.  I said, Who
                 wants to see a Civil War picture?

                            BETTY
                 Perhaps the reason I hated Bases
                 Loaded is that I knew your name.
                 I'd always heard you had some
                 talent.

                            GILLIS
                 That was last year.  This year
                 I'm trying to earn a living.

                            BETTY
                 So you take Plot 27-A, make it
                 glossy, make it slick --

                 Carefull Those are dirty words!
                 You sound like a bunch of New
                 York critics.  Thank you, Miss
                 Schaefer.

                            BETTY
                 Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.

                            GILLIS
                 Goodbye.  Next time I'll write
                 The Naked and the Dead.


          Betty leaves.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Well, seems like Zanuck's got
                 himself a baseball picture.

                            GILLIS
                 Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you
                 to think I thought this was going
                 to win any Academy Award.

                            SHELDRAKE
                      (His mind free-wheeling)
                 Of course, we're always looking
                 for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see
                 it as a Betty Hutton?

                            GILLIS
                 Frankly, no.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Sure, Gillis.  If something should
                 come along -

                            GILLIS
                 Along is no good.  I need it now.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Haven't got a thing.

                 Dialogue.

                 There's nothing, Gillis.  Not
                 even if you were a relative.

                 let me have three hundred bucks
                 yourself, as a personal loan?

                             SHELDRAKE
                 Could I?  Gillis, last year some-
                 body talked me into buying a ranch
                 in the valley.  So I borrowed money
                 from the bank so I could pay for
                 the ranch.  This year I had to
                 mortgage the ranch so I could keep
                 up my life insurance so I could
                 borrow on the insurance so I could
                 pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey
                 had been elected -

                             GILLIS

                                located that agent of mine, the
                                big faker.  Was he out digging
                                up a job for poor Joe Gillis?
                                Hmph! He was hard at work in
                                Bel Air, making with the golf
                                clubs.

          Gillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the
          booth, emerges, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
          He walks toward the exit.  He is stopped by the
          voice of

                            SKOLSKY
                 Hello, Gillis.

          Gillis looks around.  At the fountain sits Skolsky,
          drinking a cup of coffee.

                            GILLIS
                 Hello, Mr. Skolsky.

                            SKOLSKY
                 Got anything for the column?

                            GILLIS
                 Sure.  Just sold an original for
                 a hundred grand.  The Life of the
                 Warner Brothers.  Starring the Ritz
                 Brothers.  Playing opposite the
                 Andrew Sisters.

                 But don't get me wrong -- I love
                 Hollywood.

          Gillis walks out.

  A-14    THE BEL AIR GOLF LINKS

          On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores,
          stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript
          opponent in the background.  Gillis has evidently
          stated his problem already.


                            MORINO
                 So you need three hundred dollars?
                 Of course, I could give you three
                 hundred dollars.  Only I'm not
                 going to.

                            GILLIS
                 No?

                            MORINO
                 Gillis, get this through your
                 head.  I'm not just your agent.
                 It's not the ten per cent.  I'm
                 your friend.

          He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee,
          Gillis following him.

                            GILLIS
                 How's that about your being my
                 friend?

                            MORINO
                 Don't you know the finest things
                 in the world have been written on
                 an empty stomach?  Once a talent
                 like yours gets into that Mocambo-
                 Romanoff rut, you're through.

                            GILLIS
                 Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car
                 I'm talking about.  If I lose my
                 car it's like having my legs out off.

                            MORINO
                 Greatest thing that could happen
                 to you.  Now you'll have to sit
                 behind that typewriter.  Now
                 you'll have to write.

                            GILLIS
                 What do you think I've been doing?
                 I need three hundred dollars.

                            MORINO
                      (Icily)
                 Maybe what you need is another agent.

          He bends down to tee up his ball.  Gillis turns away.

  A-16    ANOTHER CAR

          It is a dark-green Dodge business coupe, also waiting
          for the light to change.  but headed in the opposite
          direction.  In it are the two finance company men.
          They spot Gillis in his car and exchange looks.  From
          across the intersection Gillis recognizes them and
          pulls down the leather sunshade to screen his face.

          traffic and start after him.

          and then -- while they are trapped behind a slow-
          moving truck.  he disappears again.


  A-22    GILLIS

          He is driving as fast as he dares, keeping an eye out
          for pursuit in his rear-view mirror.  Suddenly his
          right front tire blows out.  Gillis clutches desperately
          at the steering wheel and manages to turn the careening
          car into

  A-23    A DRIVEWAY

          It is overgrown with weeds and screened from the street
          by bushes and trees.  Gillis stops his car about thirty
          feet from the street and looks back.

          shoots past the driveway, still looking for Gillis.

          It is a grandiose --   It was a great big white

          mottled by the years,  crazy movie people built in the

          Behind a bamboo blind there is a movement of
          a dark figure.

  A-29    GILLIS

          He stands flabbergasted.  A new noise attracts his
          attention -- the creak of a heavy metal-and-glass
          door being opened.  He turns and sees

  A-3O    THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE HOUSE

          Max von Mayerling stands there.  He is sixty, and
          all in black, except for immaculate white cotton
          gloves, shirt, high, stiff collar and a white bow
          tie.  His coat is shiny black alpaca, his trousers
          ledger-atriped.  He is semi-paralyzed.  The left
          side of his mouth is pulled down, and he leans on a
          rubber-ferruled stick.

                            MAX
                 In here!

          Gillis enters the shot.


                            GILLIS
                 I just put my car in the garage.
                 I had a blow-out.  I thought --

                            MAX
                 Go on in.

          There is authority in the gesture of his white-
          gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, maybe I'd better take my
                 car --

                            MAX
                 Wipe your feet!

          Automatically, Gillis wipes his feet on an enormous
          shabby cocoanut mat.

                 You are not dressed properly.

                            GILLIS
                 Dressed for what?

                 Madame is waiting.

                            GILLIS
                 For me?  Okay.

          Gillis enters.


  A-31    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ENTRANCE HALL

          It is grandiose and grim.  The whole place is one of
          those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling
          alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and
          beams imported from Italy, with California termites
          at work on them.  Portieres are drawn before all the
          windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their
          way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always
          burning.



          Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble
          staircase.  It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn
          velvet rope along the wall.

                            MAX
                      (From below)
                 If you need help with the
                 coffin call me.

          The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis'
          imagination.  He climbs the stairs with a kind of
          morbid fascination.  At the top he stops, undecided,
          then turns to the right and is stopped by

                            WOMAN'S VOICE
                 This way!

          Gillis swings around.

          Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a
          doorway from which emerges a flickering light.  She
          is a little woman.  There is a curious style, a
          great sense of high voltage about her.  She is dress-
          ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled
          pumps.  Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-
          terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of
          the same material.  Her skin is very pale, and she
          is wearing dark glasses.

                            NORMA
                 In here.  I put him on my massage
                 table in front of the fire.  He
                 always liked fires and poking at
                 them with a stick.

          Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into


  A-32    NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM

          It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which
          has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly
          torn in a few places.  There's a great, unmade gilded
          bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had
          begun to peel.  There is a disorder of clothes and
          negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars
          about.

          In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-
          ing.  On the massage table before it lies a small
          form shrouded under a Spanish shawl.  At each end on
          a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande-
          labrum, the candles lighted.

                            NORMA
                 I've made up my mind we'll bury him in
                 the garden.  Any city laws against that?


                            GILLIS
                 I wouldn't know.

                            NORMA
                 I don't care anyway.  I want the
                 coffin to be white.  And I want
                 it specially lined with satin.
                 White, or deep pink.

          She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the
          color.  From under the shawl flops down a dead arm.
          Gillis stares and recoils a little.  It is like a
          child's arm, only black and hairy.

                            NORMA
                 Maybe red.  bright flaming red.
                 Gay.  Let's make it gay.

          Gillis edges closer and glances down.  Under the
          shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead
          chimpanzee.  Norma drops back the shawl.

                            NORMA
                 How much will it be?  I warn you -
                 don't give me a fancy price just
                 because I'm rich.

                            GILLIS
                 Lady.  you've got the wrong man.

          For the first time.  Norma really looks at him
          through her dark glasses.

                            GILLIS
                 I had some trouble with my car.
                 Flat tire.  I pulled into your
                 garage till I could get a spare.
                 I thought this was an empty house.

                            NORMA
                 It is not.  Get out.

                            GILLIS
                 I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost
                 your friend, and I don't think red
                 is the right color.

                            NORMA
                 Get out.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't
                 I seen you -- ?


                            NORMA
                 Or shall I call my servant?

                            GILLIS
                 I know your face.  You're Norma
                 Desmond.  You used to be in
                 pictures.  You used to be big.

                            NORMA
                 I am big.  It's the pictures
                 that got small.

                            GILLIS
                 I knew there was something
                 wrong with them.

                            NORMA
                 They're dead.  They're finished.
                 There was a time when this busi-
                 ness had the eyes of the whole
                 wide world.  But that wasn't good
                 enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the
                 ears of the world, too.  So they
                 opened their big mouths, and out
                 came talk, talk, talk...

                            GILLIS
                 That's where the popcorn business
                 comes in.  You buy yourself a bag
                 and plug up your ears.

                            NORMA
                 Look at them in the front offices --
                 the master minds! They took the
                 idols and smashed them.  The
                 Fairbankses and the Chaplins and
                 the Gilberts and the Valentinos.
                 And who have they got now?  Some
                 nobodies -- a lot of pale little
                 frogs croaking pish-poshl

                            GILLIS
                 Don't get sore at me.  I'm not
                 an executive.  I'm just a writer.

                            NORMA
                 You are! Writing words, words!
                 You've made a rope of words and
                 strangled this businessl But there
                 is a microphone right there to catch
                 the last gurgles, and Technicolor
                 to photograph the red, swollen tongue!



                            GILLIS
                 Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.

                            NORMA
                 Get out!

          Gillis starts down the stairs.

                            GILLIS
                 Next time I'll bring my autograph
                 album along, or maybe a hunk of
                 cement and ask for your footprints.

          He is halfway down the staircase when he is
          stopped by

                            NORMA
                 Just a minute, you!

                            GILLIS
                 Yeah?

                            NORMA
                 You're a writer, you said.

                            GILLIS
                 Why?

          Norma starts down the stairs.

                            NORMA
                 Are you or aren't you?

                            GILLIS
                 I think that's what it says on my
                 driver's license.

                            NORMA
                 And you have written pictures,
                 haven't you?

                            GILLIS
                 Sure have.  The last one I
                 wrote was about cattle rustlers.
                 Before they were through with it,
                 the whole thing played on a
                 torpedo boat.

          Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase.

                            NORMA
                 I want to ask you something.
                 Come in here.

          She leads him into


  A-33    THE HUGE LIVING ROOM

          It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and
          red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props
          from the Mark of Zorro set.  Along the main wall,
          a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years.
          On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of
          Norma Desmond in her various roles.  On one wall
          is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene,
          Carthay Circle school.  (We will learn later that
          it hides a motion picture screen.)

          One corner is filled with a large pipe organ, and
          as Norma and Gillis enter, there is a grizzly
          moaning sound.  Gillis looks around.

                            NORMA
                 The wind gets in that blasted
                 pipe organ.  I ought to have
                 it taken out.

                            GILLIS
                 Or teach it a better tune.

          Norma has led him to the card tables which stand
          side by side near a window.  They are piled high
          with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand.

                            NORMA
                 How long is a movie script these
                 days?  I mean, how many pages?

                            GILLIS
                 Depends on what it is -- a Donald
                 Duck or Joan or Arc.

                            NORMA
                 This is to be a very important
                 picture.  I have written it
                 myself.  Took me years.

                            GILLIS
                      (Looking at the piles
                       of script)
                 Looks like enough for six impor-
                 tant pictures.

                            NORMA
                 It's the story or Salome.  I
                 think I'll have DeMille direct it.

                            GILLIS
                 Uh-huh.


                            NORMA
                 We've made a lot of pictures
                 together.

                            GILLIS
                 And you'll play Salome?

                            NORMA
                 Who else ?

                            GILLIS
                 Only asking.  I did't know
                 you were planning a comeback.

                            NORMA
                 I hate that word.  It is a return.
                 A return to the millions of people
                 who have never forgiven me for
                 deserting the screen.

                            GILLIS
                 Fair enough.

                            NORMA
                 Salome -- what a woman! What a
                 part! The Princess in love with
                 a Holy man.  She dances the Dance
                 of the Seven Veils.  He rejects
                 her, so she demands his head on a
                 golden tray, kissing his cold, dead
                 lips.

                            GILLIS
                 They'll love it in Pomona.

                            NORMA
                      (Taking it straight)
                 They will love it every place.
                      (She reaches for a
                       batch of pages from
                       the heap)
                 Read it.  Read the scene just
                 before she has him killed!

                            GILLIS
                 Right now?  Never let another
                 writer read your stuff.  He
                 may steal it.

                            NORMA
                 I am not afraid.  Read it!

                            NORMA (Cont'd)
                      (Calling)
                 Max!  Max!
                      (To Gillis)
                 Sit down.  Is there enough light?

                            GILLIS
                 I've got twenty-twenty vision.

          Max has entered.

                            NORMA
                 Bring something to drink.

                            MAX
                 Yes.  Madame.

          He leaves.  Norma turns to Gillis again.

                            NORMA
                 I said sit down.

          There is compulsion in her voice.

          Gillis looks at her                   GILLIS' VOICE
          and starts slowly          Well.  I had no pressing
          reading.                   engagement, and she'd men-
                                     tioned something to drink..
          Max comes in, wheeling     Sometimes it's interesting
          a wicker tea wagon on      to see just how bad bad
          which are two bottles o    writing can be.  This prom-

          a jar of caviar.  Norma    childish scrawl of hers.
          sits on her feet.  deep    Max wheeled in some champagne
          in a chair, a gold ring    and some caviar.  Later, I
          on her forefinger with     found out that Max was the
          a clip which holds a       only other person in that
          cigarette.  She gets up    grim Sunset castle, and I
          and forces on Gillis       found out a few other things
          another batch of script,   about him... As for her, she
          goes back to her chair.    sat coiled up like a watch
                                     spring, her cigarette
                                     clamped in a curious holder...
                                     I could sense her eyes on me
                                     from behind those dark
                                     glasses, defying me not to
                                     like what I read, or maybe
                                     begging me in her own proud
                                     way to like it.  It meant
                                     so much to her...



  A-34    SHOT OF THE                       GILLIS' VOICE
          CEILING                It sure was a cozy set-up.

          duskier.)

          DISSOLVE TO:


  A-35    GILLIS                 It got to be eleven.  I was
                                 feeling a little sick at my
          reading.  The lamp     stomach, what with that sweet
          beside him is now      champagne and that tripe I'd
          really paying its      been reading -- that silly
          way in the dark room.  hodgepodge of melodramatic
          A lot of the manu-     plots.  However, by then I'd
          script pages are       started concocting a little
          piled on the floor     plot of my own...
          around his feet.  A
          half-empty champagne
          glass stands on the
          arm of his chair.

          THE CAMERA SLOWLY DRAWS BACK to include Norma
          Desmond sitting in the dusk, just as she was before.
          Gillis puts down a batch of script.  There is a
          little pause.

                           NORMA
                     (Impatiently)
                 Well?

                           GILLIS
                 This is fascinating.

                           NORMA
                 Of course it is.

                           GILLIS
                 Maybe it's a little long and
                 maybe there are some repetitions...
                 but you're not a professional
                 writer.

                            NORMA
                 I wrote that with my heart.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure you did.  That's what makes
                 it great.  What it needs is a
                 little more dialogue.

                            NORMA
                 What for?  I can say anything I
                 want with my eyes.

                            GILLIS
                 It certainly could use a pair of
                 shears and a blue pencil.

                            NORMA
                 I will not have it butchered.

                            GILLIS
                 Of course not.  But it ought to
                 be organized.  Just an editing
                 job.  You can find somebody.

                            NORMA
                 Who?  I'd have to have somebody
                 I can trust.  When were you born --
                 I mean, what sign of the zodiac?

                            GILLIS
                 I don't know.

                            NORMA
                 What month?

                            GILLIS
                 December twenty-first.

                            NORMA
                 Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians.
                 You can trust them.

                            GILLIS
                 Thank you.

                            NORMA
                 I want you to do this work.

                            GILLIS
                 Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished
                 one script.  I'm due on another
                 assignment.

                            NORMA
                 I don't care.


                            GILLIS
                 You know, I'm pretty expensive.
                 I get five hundred a week.

                            NORMA
                 I wouldn't worry about money.
                 I'll make it worth your while.

                            GILLIS
                 Maybe I'd better take the rest
                 of the script home and read it -

                            NORMA
                 Oh no.  I couldn't let it out
                 of my house.  You'll have to
                 finish it here.

                            GILLIS
                 It's getting kind of late --

                            NORMA
                 Are you married, Mr.  -- ?

                            GILLIS
                 The name is Gillis.  I'm single.

                 There's something wrong with
                 your car, you said.

                            GILLIS
                 There sure is.

                            NORMA
                 You can stay here.

                            GILLIS
                 I'll come early tomorrow.

          Norma takes off her glasses.

                            NORMA
                 Nonsense.  There's room over the
                 garage.  Max will take you there...Max!

                                 which said: "Her eyes are like

                                 strange animals come to drink."

  A-36    SMALL STAIRCASE, LEAD-          GILLIS'VOICE
          ING TO ROOM OVER GARAGE  I felt kind of pleased with
                                   the way I'd handled the sit-

                                   there should be plenty of
                                   money in it...

          Max pushes open a door at the top of the stairs.

                            MAX
                      (Opening the door)
                 I made your bed this afternoon.

                            GILLIS
                 Thanks.
                      (On second thought)
                 How did you know I was going to
                 stay, this afternoon?

          Max doesn't answer.  He walks across to the bed,
          screws a bulb in the open socket above it.  The
          light goes on, revealing:

  A-37    A GABLED BEDROOM

          There are dirty windows on two sides, and dingy wall-
          paper on the cracked plaster walls.  For furniture
          there is a neatly made bed, a table and a few chairs
          which might have been discarded from the main house.

                            MAX
                 This room has not been used for
                 a long time.

                            GILLIS
                 It will never make house Beautiful.
                 I guess it's O.K. for one night.

          Max gives him an enigmatic look.

                            MAX
                      (Pointing)
                 There is the bathroom.  I put in
                 soap and a toothbrush.

                            GILLIS

                 Say, she's quite a character,
                 that Norma Desmond.

                            MAX
                 She was the greatest.  You wouldn't
                 know.  You are too young.  In one
                 week she got seventeen thousand fan
                 letters.  Men would bribe her mani-
                 curist to get clippings from her
                 fingernails.  There was a Maharajah
                 who came all the way from Hyderabad
                 to get one of her stockings.  Later,
                 he strangled himself with it.

                            GILLIS
                 I sure turned into an interesting
                 driveway.

          THE DESMOND HOUSE        There was a tennis court, or

  A-41    GILLIS - IN THE WINDOW

          He stares down, his stomach slowly turning.


  A-42    THE SWIMMING POOL

          At the bottom of the basin a great rat is eating a
          decaying or,ange.  From the inlet pipe crawl two
          other rats, who join battle with the first rat over
          the orange.

          one of the candelabra, all
          of its candles flickering
          in the wind.  They reach
          the grave and lower the
          coffin into it.  Then,
          Norma lighting his task
          with the candelabrum, Max
          takes a spade from the
          loose earth and starts
          filling in the grave.

          a heavy overstuffed chair
          in front of the door, then
          walks towards the bed,
          throws himself on it,
          picking up some of the
          manuscript pages to read.

          sits down and starts
          putting on his moccasins
          hastily.

          DISSOLVE TO:


   B-7    A PAIR OF HANDS IN WHITE GLOVES, PLAYING THE ORGAN

          PULL BACK: They belong to Max von Mayerling.  He
          is sitting erect, his bull neck taut as a wrestler's
          as he rights out somber chord after somber chord.
          He sits in a shaft of gray light coming from an open
          French window.

          Through the far archway, Gillis storms into the big
          room.

                            GILLIS
                Hey, you -- Max -- whatever -your-
                name-is -- what are my things doing
                here?

          No answer.

                            GILLIS
                I'm talking to you.  My clothes
                and things are up in the room.

                            MAX
                Naturally.  I brought them myself.

                            GILLIS
                      (Furiously)
                Is that so!

                            MAX
                Why are you so upset?  Is there
                anything missing?

                            GILLIS
                Who said you could?  Who asked you to?

          Norma Desmond's shadow moves into the shaft of
          light.

                             NORMA'S VOICE
                  I did.

          Gillis looks around.

          On the couch by the fireplace reclines Norma Desmond,
          dressed in a negligee.  She rises.

                             NORMA
                  I don't know why you should be
                  so upset.  Stop that playing,
                  Max.
                       (To Gillis again)
                  It seemed like a good idea --
                  if we are to work together.

                             GILLIS
                  Look, I'm supposed to fix up
                  your script.  There's nothing
                  in the deal about my staying
                  here.

                             NORMA
                  You'll like it here.

                             GILLIS
                  Thanks for the invitation, but
                  I have my own apartment.

                             NORMA
                  You can't work in an apartment
                  where you owe three months' rent.

                             GILLIS
                  I'll take care of that.

                             NORMA
                  It's all taken care of.  It's
                  all paid for.

                             GILLIS
                  I'm used to paying my own bills.

                             NORMA
                  You proud boy, why didn't you tell

          Gillis sits at an impro-     So I let him unpack my
          vised table, his typewriter  things. I wanted the

          Pencils, shears and a        quickly as possible.
          paste-pot at hand.           I thought if I really

          the cigaette contraption     scrambled melodrama

                                       child of hers.

          Gillis takes two or three pages from Norma's hand-
          written script, crosses them out and puts them to
          one side.

          Norma rises, crosses towards Gillis, looks over his
          shoulder.

                            NORMA
                  What's that?

                            GILLIS

                  Honestly, it's a little old hat.
                  They don't want that any more.

          is old-fashioned, but shows her incredible beauty

                            GILLIS
                 I don't need any clothes, and
                 I certainly don't want you buy-

                   I just want you to look nice,

          By this time Max has made a U-turn.

   B-23   INT. MEN'S DEPARTMENT, AN ELEGANT WILSHIRE STORE

          Gillis stands in front of a full-length triple mirror,
          surrounded by a couple of salesmen and the tailor, who
          is busily working out alterations.

          Gillis wears a double-breasted gray flannel coat with
          chalk stripes.  His trousers belong to another suit
          of glen plaid.  Norma is running the show.

                   There's nothing like gray flannel
                   with a chalk stripe.

                       the trousers)
                   This one single-breasted, of course.
                       (to another salesman)
                   Now we need a topcoat.  Let's see
                   what you have in camel's hair.

          The salesman leaves.

                   How about some evening clothes?

                                GILLIS
                   I don't need a tuxedo.

                                NORMA
                   Of course you do.  A tuxedo and

                                GILLIS
                   Tails.  That's ridiculous.

                                NORMA
                   You'll need them for parties.
                   You'll need them for New Year's
                   Eve.

                    This way, Madame.

          He leads her off.  The other salesman arrives with a
          selection of topcoats.

                            SALESMAN
                    Here are some camel hairs, but
                    I'd like you just to feel this
                    one.  It's Vicuna.  Of course,
                    it's a little more expensive.

                            GILLIS
                    A camel's hair will do.

                    for it, why not take the Vicuna?

  C-3     A BEDROOM IN TIiE MAIN HOUSE

          It is obviously a man's room -- heavy Spanish
          furniture -- one wall nothing but a closet with
          shelves and drawers for shirts and shoes.  Max is
          hanging up the suits.  Gillis throws the shirts on
          a big chair, tosses the slippers at the foot of the
          bed, places the typewriter and manuscript on a desk
          at the window.

                            GILLIS
                 Whose room was this?

                            MAX
                 It was the room of the husband.
                 Or of the husbands, I should say.
                 Madame has been married three
                 times.

          Slightly embarrassed, Gillis picks up his toilet
          kit with razor, toothbrushes, soap, etc., and starts
          towards the bathroom, pausing en route at a rain-
          splattered window.

                            GILLIS
                 I guess this is the one you
                 can see Catalina from.  Only
                 this isn't the day.

                 He proceeds towards the half-opened door leading
                 to the bathroom.  Something strikes his attention
                 and he stops.  As in the door to the room above
                 the garage, this lock, too, has been gouged out.

                            GILLIS
                 Hey, what's this with the
                 door? There isn't any lock.

                            MAX
                 There are no locks anywhere
                 in this house.

          He points to the entrance door of the room, and to
          another door.

                            GILLIS
                 How come?

                            MAX
                 The doctor suggested it.

                            GILLIS
                 What doctor?

                            MAX
                 Madame's doctor.  She has moments
                 of melancholy.  There have been
                 some suicide attempts.

                            GILLIS
                 Uh-huh?

                            MAX
                 We have to be very careful.  No
                 sleeping pills, no razor blades.
                 We shut off the gas in her bed-
                 room.

                            GILLIS
                 Why?  Her career?  She got enough
                 out of it.  She's not forgotten.
                 She still gets those fan letters.

                            MAX
                 I wouldn't look too closely at the
                 postmarks.

                            GILLIS
                 You send them.  Is that it, Max?

                            MAX
                 I'd better press your evening
                 clothes, sir.  You have not for-

                            GILLIS
                 No, I haven't.  I suppose all
                 the waxworks are coming?

                            MAX
                 I don't know, sir.  Madame made
                 the arrangements.

          Max leaves.  Gillis comes out of the bathroom, picks
          up his shirts, goes over to a closet, opens it.  As
          he does so one of the doors without a lock swings
          slightly open.  Gillis looks through the half-open
          door and sees.

          in the archway leading to
          the big room and looks
          around.

  C-6     THE BIG ROOM has been deco-

          laurel garlands.  Dozens of
          candles in all the sconces

          Their flickering flames are
          reflected in the waxed sur=

          There is a buffet, with

          moves toward him.

                 You know, this floor used to
                 be wood but I had it changed.
                 Valentino said there is nothing

          Norma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair
          and tosses them away.

          As they play the tango, the musicians eye the danc-

                 What's that?

                            NORMA
                 I'm in love with you.  Don't you
                 know that? I've been in love
                 with you all along.

          They dance on.  Gillis is acutely embarrassed.
          THE CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, PANS past the faces
          of the musicians, who play on with a rather overe-
          mphasized lack of interest.  Finally it winds up
          on Max, behind the buffet.  He stands watching Gillis,
          a faint trace of pity in his eyes.

  C-9     NORMA'S FINGER, WITH THE
          CIGARETTE GADGET, as she          GILLIS' VOICE
          inserts a cigarette.        I'm sure a lot of you will
                                      laugh about this.  Ridicu-
                                      lous situation, wasn't it?
                                      -- a woman almost twice my
                                      age ...  It got to be about
                                      a quarter of eleven.  I
                                      felt caught, like a cig-
                                      arette in the prongs of
                                      that contraption on her
                                      finger.
          PULL BACK TO:

          NORMA AND GILLIS sitting on a couch in front of the
          cavernous fireplace.  Norma holds out her cigarette
          to Gillis, who lights it.


                            NORMA.
                 What a wonderful next year it's
                 going to be.  What fun we're going
                 to have.  I'II fill the pool for
                 you.  Or I'll open my house in
                 Malibu, and you can have the whole
                 ocean.  Or I'll buy you a boat
                 and we'll sail to Hawaii.

                            GILLIS
                 Stop it.  You aren't going to buy
                 me anything more.

                            NORMA
                 Don't be silly.
                      (She reaches under a
                       pillow of the couch
                       and brings out a
                       leather box)
                 Here.  I was going to give it to
                 you at midniglht.

          Gillis opens the box.  It contains a matched gold
          cigarette case and lighter.

                            NORMA
                 Read what's inside.

          Gillis snaps open the case.  Engraved inside the
          cover is: TO JOE FROM NORMA, and two bars of
          music.

                            GILLIS
                 What are the notes?

                            NORMA
                 "Mad about the boy."

                            GILLIS
                 Norma, I can't take it.  You've
                 bought me enough.

                            NORMA
                 Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer
                 than all this new Hollywood trash.
                 I've got a million dollars.

                            GILLIS
                 Keep it.

                            NORMA
                 I own three blocks downtown.
                 I have oil in Bakersfield --
                 pumping, pumping, pumping.
                 What's it for but to buy us
                 anything we want.

                            GILLIS
                 Cut out that us business.

          He rises.

                            NORMA
                 What's the matter with you?

                            GILLIS
                 What right do you have to take
                 me for granted?

                            NORMA
                 What right? Do you want me to
                 tell you?

                            GILLIS
                 Has it ever occurred that I may
                 have a life of my own? That there
                 may be some girl I'm crazy about?

                            NORMA
                 Who? Some car hop, or a dress
                 extra?

                            GILLIS
                 Why not? What I'm trying to say
                 is that I'm all wrong for you.
                 You want a Valentino -- somebody
                 with polo ponies -- a big shot --

                            NORMA
                      (Getting up slowly)
                 What you're trying to say is
                 that you don't want me to love
                 you.  Is that it?

          Gillis doesn't answer.  Norma slaps his face and
          rushes from the room and upstairs.

          Gillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek.


  C-1O    THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR

          Norma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor
          and into her bedroom, banging the door.  MOVE THE
          CAMERA toward the closed door, centering on the
          gouged-out lock.


  C-11    GILLIS, IN THE BIG ROOM

          He still stands motionless.  He glances around fur-
          tively, to see if his humiliation has been observed.


  C-12    THE ORCHESTRA

          The musicians are playing away.  They have turned
          their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious-
          ly for comfort.


  C-13    GILLIS

          His eyes move over toward


  C-14    MAX

          He is subtler than the musicians.  He appears very
          busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used
          glasses on a tray.  He walks across the room with
          them.


  C-15    GILLIS

          He starts slowly out.  As he does so his long gold
          key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa
          and holds him for a second of additional embarrass-
          ment.  He yanks it loose and walks with as much
          nonchalance as he can muster to


  C-16    THE HALL

          Crossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a
          look upstairs.  Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from
          its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the
          entrance door.  He opens the door on the darkness
          of the courtyard.


  C-17    EXT. DESMOND HOUSE 
          (NIGHT - RAIN)

          Gillis shuts the door.           GILLIS'VOICE
          He takes a few steps       I didn't know where I was
          forward, then stands       going.  I just had to get
          for a while breathing      out of there.  I had to be
          deep.  The rain is         with people my own age.  I
          balm to that cheek         had to hear somebody laugh
          where the slap still a     again.  I thought of Artie
          burns.  He walks for-      Green.  There was bound to
          ward with a great          be a New Year's shindig
          sense of relief.           going on in his apartment
                                     down on Las Palmas -- the
                                     hock shop set -- not a job
  C-18    DRIVEWAY LEADING TO        in the room.  but lots of
          	fun on the cuff.

          Gillis walks to the
          street, which is dark
          and empty.  He starts
          down Sunset in an
          Easterly direction.
          A car passes.  He
          tries to thumb a
          ride, without success.
          However, the second

          car, a florist's
          delivery wagon, stops.
          Gillis jumps in and the
          car drives off.

          DISSOLVE TO:

  C-19    ARTIE GREEN'S APARTMENT

          It is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed
          with young people flowing over into the miniature
          bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette.  The only
          drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass
          bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time.
          Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only
          a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests
          party dress.

          Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano
          and sings Tokio Rose.  By the door, a group of young
          men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso
          White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar,
          in the manner of a Bach choral.  Artie Green, a dark
          haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties,
          is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl.

          The door behind some of the singers is pushed open,
          jostling them out of their places.  In comes Gillis,
          his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat
          turned up.  Artie stops conducting, but the commer-
          cial goes right on.

                            ARTIE
                 Well, what do you know ! Joe
                 Gillis !

                            GILLIS
                 Hi, Artie.

                            ARTIE
                 Where have you been keeping that
                 gorgeous face of yours?

                            GILLIS
                 In a deep freeze.

                            ARTIE
                 I almost reported you to the Bureau
                 of Missing Persons.
                      (To the company)
                 Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the
                 well-known screen writer, opium
                 smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.

          Gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and
          Artie push their way into the room.

                            ARTIE
                 Give me your coat.

                            GILLIS
                 Let it ride for a while.

                            ARTIE
                 You're going to stay, aren't you?

                            GILLIS
                 That was the general idea.

                            ARTIE
                 Come on.

          Artie starts peeling the coat off Gillis.  Its
          texture takes his breath away.

                            ARTIE
                 What is this - mink?

          He has taken the coat.  He looks at Gillis standing
          there in tails.

                            ARTIE
                 Judas E. Priest, who did you
                 borrow that from? Adolphe
                 Menjou?

                            GILLIS
                 Close, but no cigar.

          Gillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the
          Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book-
          shelf.

                            ARTIE
                 Say, you're not really smuggling
                 opium these days,  are you?

                            GILLIS
                 Where's the bar?

          The two make their way toward the punch bowl.  It's
          a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis.  There
          are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails.
          When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a
          half-filled glass and fills it.

                            GILLIS
                 Good party.

                            ARTIE
                 The greatest.  They call me the Elsa
                 Maxwell of the assistant directors.
                      (To some guests who are
                       dipping their empty cups
                       into the punch bowl)
                 Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget
                 only calls for three drinks per extra.
                 Fake the rest.

                            GILLIS
                 Listen, Artie, can I stick around
                 here for a while?


                            ARTIE
                 Sure, this'll go on all night.

                            GILLIS
                 I mean, could you put me up for
                 a couple of weeks?

                            ARTIE
                 It just so happens we have a
                 vacancy on the couch.

                            GILLIS
                 I'll take it.

                            ARTIE
                 I'll have the bell-hop take care
                 of your luggage.

          He runs his finger across the decollete back of a
          girl standing in a group next them.

                            ARTIE
                 Just register here.

          The girl turns around.  She is Betty Schaefer.

                            BETTY
                 Hello, Mr.  Gillis.

                            ARTIE
                 You know each other?

          Gillis looks at her a little puzzled.

                            BETTY
                 Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter,
                 Sheldrake's office.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure.  Bases Loaded.

                            ARTIE
                 Wait a minute.  This is the woman
                 I love.  What's going on? Who
                 was loaded?

                            GILLIS
                 Don't worry.  She's just a fan
                 for my literary output.

                            BETTY
                      (to Artie)
                 Hurt feelings department.

                            GILLIS
                 About that luggage.  Where's
                 the phone?

                            ARTIE
                 Over by the Rainbow Room.

          Gillis squeezes his way through groups of people
          to the telephone, which is next to an open door
          leading to the bathroom.  The phone is busy.  A
          girl sits listening to it, giggling wildly.  Another
          girl beside her is laughing too.  They are apparently
          sharing a conversation with some man on the other end
          of the wire.  The telephone passes from hand to hand.
          Gillis watches impatiently, then

                            GILLIS
                 When youlre through with that
                 thing, can I have it?

          The girl just nods, going on with her chattering.
          Gillis stands waiting, and Betty Schaefer comes up
          with his glass.

                            BETTY
                 You forgot this.

                            GILLIS
                 Thanks.

                            BETTY
                 I've been hoping to run into you.

                            GILLIS
                 What for? To recover that knife
                 you stuck in my back?

                            BETTY
                 I felt a little guilty, so I got
                 out some of your old stories.

                            GILLIS
                 Why, you sweet kid.

                            BETTY
                 There's one called....Window...
                 something with a window.

                            GILLIS
                 Dark Windows.  How did you
                 like it?

                            BETTY
                 I didn't.

                            GILLIS
                 Thank you.

                            BETTY
                 Except for about six pages.
                 You've got a flashback there ...

          There is too much racket for her.

                            BETTY
                 Is there someplace we can talk?

                            GILLIS
                 How about the Rainbow Room?

          They squeeze their way towards the bathroom, past
          Artie.

                            ARTIE
                 I said you could have my couch.
                 I didn't say you could have my
                 girl.

                            BETTY
                 This is shop talk.

          She and Gillis go through the open door into


  C-20    ARTIE'S BATHROOM

          It's a little less noisy, although there are some
          guests there, chatting and having fun.  Betty and
          Gillis sit down on the edge of the tub.

                            GILLIS
                 Now if I got you correctly, there
                 was a short stretch of my fiction
                 you found worthy of notice.

                            BETTY
                 The flashback in the courtroom,
                 when she tells about being a
                 school teacher.

                            GILLIS
                 I had a teacher like that once.

                            BETTY
                 Maybe that's why it's good.
                 It's true, it's moving.  Now
                 why don't you use that character...

                            GILLIS
                 Who wants true? Who wants moving?

                            BETTY
                 Drop that attitude.  Here's some-
                 thing really worth while.

                            GILLIS
                 Want me to start right now?
                 Maybe there's some paper around.

                            BETTY
                 I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.

                            GILLIS
                 I've got some ideas myself.  One
                 of them being this is New Year's
                 Eve.  How about living it up a
                 little?

                            BETTY
                 As for instance?

                            GILLIS
                 Well....

                            BETTY
                 We could make some paper boats
                 and have a regatta.  Or should
                 we just turn on the shower?

                            GILLIS
                 How about capturing the kitchen
                 and barricading the door?

                            BETTY
                 Are you hungry?

                            GILLIS
                 Hungry? After twelve years in
                 the Burmese jungle.  I am starving,
                 Lady Agatha -- starving for a
                 white shoulder --

                            BETTY
                 Phillip, you're mad!

          One of the girls who was on the phone comes to
          the door.

                               GIRL
                 You can have the phone now.

                               GILLIS
                      (Paying no attention)
                 Thirsting for the coolness of
                 your lips -

                               BETTY
                 No, Phillip, no.  We must be
                 strong.  You're still wearing
                 the uniform of the Coldstream
                 Guards!  Furthermore, you can
                 have the phone now.

                               GILLIS
                 O.K.
                      (He gets up, starts
                       out, turns)
                 I find I'm terribly afraid of
                 losing you.

                               BETTY
                 You won't.
                      (She takes the glass
                       out of his hand)
                 I'll get us a refill of
                 this awful stuff.

                               GILLIS
                 You'll be waiting for me?

                               BETTY
                 With a wildly beating heart.

                               GILLIS
                 Life can be beautiful!

          He leaves.


  C-21    THE MAIN ROOM

          Gillis squeezes himself through some guests to
          the phone.  He has to stand in a cramped position,
          holding the instrument close to him as he dials
          a number.

                               GILLIS
                 Max?  This is Mr. Gillis.
                 I want you to do me a favor.

  C-22    NORMA DESMOND HOUSE

          Max is at the phone, in the lower hall.

                            MAX
                 I am sorry, Mr.  Gillis.
                 I cannot talk now.


  C-23    GILLIS ON THE PHONE

                            GILLIS
                 Yes you can.  I want you to get
                 my old suitcase and I want you
                 to throw in my old clothes --
                 the ones I came with, and my
                 typewriter.  I'll have somebody
                 pick them up.


  C-24    MAX AT THE PHONE

                            MAX
                 I have no time to talk.  The
                 doctor is here.


  C-25    GILLIS ON THE PHONE

                            GILLIS
                 What doctor? What's going on?


  C-26    MAX AT THE PHONE

                            MAX
                 She got the razor from your
                 room.  She cut her wrists.

          Max hangs up, moves toward the staircase.


  C-27    GILLIS AT THE PHONE

                            GILLIS
                 Max ! Max !

          He hangs up the dead receiver, stands numb   with
          shock.  Betty elbows her way up to him, carrying
          the two punch glasses filled again.

                            BETTY
                 I just got the recipe: take
                 two packages of cough drops,
                 dissolve in one gallon of
                 lukewarm grape juice --

          Gillis looks up at her.  Without a word he pushes
          her aside so that she spills the drink.  He makes
          his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls
          it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and
          rushes towards the door and out.  Betty stands look-
          ing after him, completely bewildered.

          DISSOLVE TO:


  C-28    EXT. DESMOND HOUSE - (NIGHT, RAIN)

          The doctor's car is parked in the driveway.  A taxi
          pulls up.  Gillis, in his Vicuna coat now, jumps
          out, throws a couple of dollars to the rdriver and
          runs toward the house.


  C-28a    DOORWAY, NORMA DESMOND HOUSE>

          Max is opening the door to let out the doctor, a
          professional looking man carrying a black bag.
          Gillis runs into the SHOT.

                            GILLIS
                 How is she?

                            MAX
                 She is upstairs.

          Gillis starts to push past Max.  Max grabs his arm.

                            MAX
                 Be careful.  Do not race up the
                 stairs.  The musicians must not
                 know what has happened.

          Gillis goes into the house.


  C-29    ENRANCE HALL AND STAIRCASE

          Gillis crosses the hall and starts up the stairs.


  C-3O    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ROOM

          Only one alabaster lamp lights the big, cold room.
          On the bed lies Norma in her evening dress.  She is
          white as a sheet.  Her wrists are bandaged.  Her eyes
          are wide open, staring at the ceiling.  One of her
          shoes has halt slipped off her foot.  The other is
          on.  Gillis opens the door and stands there tor a
          second.  Then he slowly moves to the toot of the bed.
          He takes the shoes from her feet and puts them on
          the floor.

                            NORMA
                 Go away.

                            GILLIS
                 What kind of a silly thing was
                 that to do?

                            NORMA
                 To fall in love with you -- that
                 was the idiotic thing.

                            GILLIS
                 It sure would have made attractive
                 headlines: Great Star Kills Her-
                 self for Unknown Writer.

                            NORMA
                 Great stars have great pride.

          She puts one bandaged forearm over her eyes, sobbing.
          Gillis walks slowly over to the mantelpiece, stands
          there for awhile.

                            NORMA
                 Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, I was making that up because
                 I thought the whole thing was a
                 mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you.
                 You've been good to me.  You're the
                 only person in this stinking town
                 that has been good to me.

                            NORMA
                 Why don't you just say thank you
                 and go, go, go --

                            GILLIS
                 Not until you promise to act like
                 a sensible human being.

                            NORMA
                 I'll do it again, I'll do it again,
                 I'll do it again!

          Gillis stands looking at her helplessly.


  C-31    LIVING ROOM, THE DESMOND HOUSE

          The candles burned down, the orchestra playing to
          the emptiness.  The orchestra leader looks at his
          watch, rises, silences the orchestra, then starts
          them in on Auld Lang Syne.

                                                                       


  C-32    INT. NORMA'S ROOM

          Gillis still stands.  Norma lies on the bed, arms
          over her eyes, sobbing.

                            GILLIS
                 Happy New Year.

          Norma continues to sob.  Gillis goes to the bed,
          puts his arms on her shoulders and turns her around.

                            GILLIS
                 Happy New Year.

          Norma looks at him, tears in her eyes.  Slowly she
          enfolds him in her bandaged arms.

                            NORMA
                 Happy New Year.  darling.

          She kisses him.

          He hangs up.  From off comes:

                            NORMA'S VOICE
                 Who was it, Max?  What is it?


  D-1e    PATIO, NORMA'S HOUSE

          It is a sunny day.  The garden is in somewhat better
          shape.  The old house looks less unkept.  The pool
          is filled.  Norma sits on a wicker chaise longue, her
          face shielded by an enormous straw hat, her eyes by
          dark glasses.  Gillis, in bathing trunks, is on a
          rubber mattress in the pool.  Max comes to the
          entrance door.

                            MAX
                 Nothing, Madame.  Somebody Inqu-
                 iring about a stray dog.  We must
                 have a number very similar to the
                 pound.

          He starts to turn back.

                            NORMA
                 Wait a minute.  I want you to get
                 out the car.  You're going to
                 take the script over to Paramount
                 and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in
                 person.

                            MAX
                 Yes, Madame.

          He goes into the house.

                            GILLIS
                      (climbing out
                       of the water)
                 You're really going to send it
                 to De Mille?

                            NORMA
                 This is the right day.

          She indicates a typewritten letter she is holding.

                 The chart from my astrologer.
                 She read deMille's horoscope.
                 She read mine.

                            GILLIS
                 Did she read the script?

                            NORMA
                 DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio.
                 Mars has been transmitting
                 Jupiter for weeks.  Today is
                 the day of greatest conjuction.
                 Now turn around.  Let me dry
                 you.

          She puts the towel around his sholders and starts
          drying him.

                            GILLIS
                 I hope you realize, Norma,
                 that scripts don't sell on
                 astrologers' charts.

                            NORMA
                 I'm not just selling the script.
                 I'm selling me.  DeMille always
                 said I was his greatest star.

                            GILLIS
                  When did he say it, Norma?

                            NORMA
                 So he said it quite a few years
                 ago.  So what?  I never looked
                 better in my life.  Do you know
                 why?  Because I've never been as
                 happy in my life.

          She kisses him.

                 my cigarette case.

                 Have one of mine.

                 You're a darling.

          She takes a dollar bill from her purse and gives it
          to him.


  D-3     EXT. SCHWAB'S DRUGSTORE
          The car drives up and Gillis hurries into the store.


  D-4     INT. SCHWAB'S DRUGSTORE
          Business is still rather lively.  There are about a
          dozen shoppers, and the soda counter is half filled.
          Gillis enters and steps to the tobacco counter.

                            GILLIS
                      (To the salesgirl)
                 Give me a pack of those Turkish
                 cigarettes -- Melachrinos.

          The girl opens the glass showcase to locate the fancy
          brand.  From OFF comes

                 Stick 'em up, Gillis, or I'll

          Gillis turns.


  D-5     AT THE SODA FOUNTAIN

          Artie Green and Betty Schaefer sit having a sandwich
          and a milk shake.  With his forefinger and a sound
          effect, Artie riddles Gillis' body.  Gillis walks
          INTO THE SHOT.

                            GILLIS
                 Hello, Artie.  Good evening,
                 Miss Schaefer.

                            BETTY
                      (Excitedly)
                 You don't know how glad I am
                 to see youl

                            ARTIE
                 Walking out on the mob.  What's
                 the big idea?

                            GILLIS
                 I'm sorry about New Year's. Would
                 you believe me if I said I had
                 to be with a sick friend?

                            ARTIE
                 Someone in the formal set, no
                 doubt, with a ten-carat kidney
                 stone.

                            BETTY
                 Stop it, Artie, will you?
                      (To Gillis)
                 Where have you been keeping your-
                 self? I've got the most wonderful
                 news for you.

                            GILLIS
                 I haven't been keeping myself at
                 all.  Not lately.

                            BETTY
                 I called your agent.  I called the
                 Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your
                 old apartment gave me some Crestview
                 number.  There was always somebody
                 with an accent growling at me.  You
                 were not there.  You were not to be
                 spoken to.  They never heard of you.

                            GILLIS
                 Is that so? What's the wonderful
                 news?

                            BETTY
                 Sheldrake likes that angle about
                 the teacher.

                            GILLIS
                 What teacher?

                            BETTY
                 Dark Windows.  I got him all
                 hopped up about it.

                            GILLIS
                 You did?

                            BETTY
                 He thinks it could be made into
                 something.

                            GILLIS
                 Into what? A lampshade?

                            BETTY
                 Into something for Barbara Stan-
                 wyck.  They have a commitment with
                 Barbara Stanwyck.

                            ARTIE
                 Unless you'd rather have Sarah
                 Bernhardt.

                            BETTY
                 This is on the level.  Sheldrake
                 really went for it.

                            GILLIS
                 O.K.  Where's the cash?

                            BETTY
                 Where's the story? I bluffed it
                 out with a few notions of my own.
                 It's really just a springboard.
                 It needs work.

                            GILLIS
                 I was afraid of that.

                               BETTY
                    I've got twenty pages of notes.
                    I've got a pretty good character
                    for the man.

                               ARTIE
                    Could you write in plenty of back-
                    ground action, so they'll need an
                    extra assistant director?

                               BETTY
                    Shut up, Artie.
                         (To Gillis)
                    Now if we could sit down for two
                    weeks and get a story.

                               GILLIS
                    Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've
                    given up writing on spec.

                               BETTY
                    I tell you this is half sold.

                               GILLIS
                    As a matter of fact.  I've given
                    up writing altogether.

          Max has appeared in the door.

                              MAX
                   Mr. Gillis, if you please.

                              GILLIS
                   Right with you.

          Max leaves.

                              ARTIE
                   The accent! I've got it: this guy
                   is in the pay of a foreign government.
                   Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.

                              GILLIS
                   I've got to run along.  Thanks any-
                   way for your interest in my career.

                              BETTY
                   It's not your career -- it's mine.
                   I kind of hoped to get in on this
                   deal.  I don't want to be a reader
                   all my life.  I want to write.

                              GILLIS
                   Sorry if I crossed you up.

                              BETTY
                   You sure have.

                              GILLIS
                   So long.

          He realizes he's forgotten them, takes the dollar
          and hands it back to her.

                            GILLIS

          side of the parasol,      for me: the Norma Desmond
          a bandanna tied           Follies.  Her first number
          around her head with      was always the Mack Sennett
          a rabbit's-ear bow.       Bathing Beauty.
          She bats her eyes,
          winks roguishly.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that Norma's black
          pyjama trousers are rolled up over her knees and her
          black stockings rolled down below them.  The whole
          effect approximates a Mack Sennett bathing costume
          pretty effectively.  She points at a leather pour.

                 This is a rock.

          She climbs on it, pantomimes timidity, an attempted
          dive, then jumps off.

          Gillis lolls on a couch, watching the performance,
          very bored.

                            NORMA

                 Nothing is the matter.  I'm having
                 a great time.  Show me some more.

          THE CAMERA MOVES to       about that girl of Artie's,
          his face.                 that Miss Schaefer.  She
                                    was so like all us writers

          Gillis opens his eyes.

          Norma has equipped herselr with a derby hat, a cane,
          and blacked in a small moustache.  She goes into a
          little Chaplin routine.  While she is doing it, the
          telephone rings.  After a moment Max comes to the
          living room door.

                            MAX
                 It is not Mr. deMille in person.
                 It is someone by the name or Gordon
                 Cole.  He says it's very important.

                            NORMA
                 Certainly it's important.  It's
                 important enough for Mr. deMille
                 to call me personally.  The idea
                 of having an assistant call me!

                            MAX
                 I myself was surprised at Mr. de
                 Mille's manners.

                            NORMA
                 Say that I'm busy, and hang up.

                            MAX
                 Very good, Madam.

          He bows and exits.

                            NORMA
                 How do you like that? We've
                 made twelve pictures together.
                 His greatest successes.

                            GILLIS
                 Maybe deMille is shooting.

                            NORMA
                 I know that trick! He wants to
                 belittle me.  He's trying to get
                 my price down.  I've waited
                 twenty years for this call.  Now
                 Mr. deMille can wait till I'm
                 good and ready.

          DISSOLVE TO:


  D-8     NORMA, IN THE TONNEAU
          OF THE LIMOUSINE,
          DRIVING DOWN MELROSE

          She is in full makeup,             GILLIS' VOICE
          with a veil, a daring     About three days later she
          hat, a suit so stunning   was good and ready.  In-
          only she would venture    credible as it may seem,
          to wear it.  THE CAMERA   there had been some more
          PULLS BACK.  Beside her   of those calls from
          sits Gillis in the glen   Paramount.  So she put on
          plaid suit.  Max is       about half a pound of
          driving.                  makeup, fixed it up with
                                    a veil, and set forth to
                                    see deMille in person.

          Norma is examining her face in the mirror of her
          vanity.  Max, while driving, sees her in the rear
          view mirror.

                            MAX
                 If you will pardon me, Madame.
                 The shadow over the left eye
                 is not quite balanced.

                            NORMA
                 Thank you, Max.

          With a handkerchief, she corrects it.


  D-9     MAIN GATE, EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIO

          The car drives down Bronson and stops smack in front
          of the iron gate.  A young policeman is talking to
          an extra; an old policeman sits reading a newspaper.
          Max sounds the horn impatiently.

                            YOUNG POLICEMAN
                 Hold that noise!

                            MAX
                 To see Mr. de Mille.  Open the gate.

                            YOUNG POLICEMAN
                  Mr. deMille is shooting.  You
                  got an appointment?

                            MAX
                  No appointment is necessary.  I
                  am bringing Norma Desmond.

                            YOUNG POLICEMAN
                  Norma Who?

          Norma has rolled down the window on her side.  She
          calls to the old policeman.

                            NORMA
                  Jonesy! Come here, Jonesy!

                            OLD POLICEMAN
                  Yeah?
                       (He comes forward slowly)
                  Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond!
                  How have you been, Miss Desmond?

                            NORMA
                  Fine, Jonesy.  Now open that gate.

                            OLD POLICEMAN
                  Sure, Miss Desmond.
                       (To the young policeman}
                  Come on, Mac.

                            YOUNG POLICEMAN
                  They can't drive on the lot
                  without a pass.

                            OLD POLICEMAN
                  Miss Desmond can.  Come on.

          They fling open the gate.

                            OLD POLICEMAN
                       (As the car drives through)
                  Stage eighteen, Miss Desmond.

                            NORMA
                  Thank you, Jonesy.  And teach
                  your friend some manners.  Tell
                  him without me he wouldn't have
                  any job, because without me there
                  wouldn't be any Paramount Studio.
                       (To Max)
                  Go on.

          They drive through the gates.  The old policeman
          goes to wall phone beside the gate, dials a number.

                            OLD POLICEMAN
                      (Into phone)
                 Norma Desmond coming in to
                 see Mr. deMille.

  D-10    STAGE 18

          A scene from SAMPSON AND DELILAH is being rehearsed
          in the background.  The usual turbulent activity
          surrounds it: extras.  makeup men, grips,
          assistants, etc., etc.  In the dim foreground a
          stage hand is answering a stand telephone.  He
          puts down the phone and moves (CAMERA WITH HIM)
          to a second assistant.

                            STAGE HAND
                 Norma Desmond is coming to see
                 Mr. deMille.

          The second assistant walks (CAMERA WITH HIM)
          to the first assistant.

                            2nd ASSISTANT
                 Norma Desmond coming in to
                 see Mr. deMille.

          The first assistant (CAMERA WITH HIM) hurries
          to the set.  Sitting with his back toward us
          is C.B. himself.  He is rehearsing a scene with
          Hedy Lamarr.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 Norma Desmond is coming in to
                 see you, Mr. deMille.

          C. B. turns his head.

                            DEMILLE
                 Norma Desmond?

                            lst ASSISTANT
                 She must be a million years old.

                            DEMILLE
                 I hate to think where that puts
                 me.  I could be her father.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.

          By this time de Mille is on his feet.

                            DEMILLE
                 It must be about that appalling
                 script of hers.  What can I say
                 to her? What can I say?

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I can tell her you're all tied
                 up in the projection room.  I
                 can give her the brush ...

                            DEMILLE
                 Listen, thirty million fans
                 have given her the brush.
                 Isn't that enough?

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I didn't mean to --

                            DEMILLE
                 Of course you didn't.  You didn't
                 know Norma Desmond as a plucky
                 little girl of seventeen, with
                 more courage and wit and heart
                 than ever came together in one
                 youngster.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I hear she was a terror to
                 work with.

                            DEMILLE
                 She got to be.  A dozen press
                 agents working overtime can
                 do terrible things to the human
                 spirit.
                      (to the set)
                 Hold everything.

          He leaves, accompanied by his entourage.

  D-11    EXT. STAGE 18

          Norma's limousine drives up.  Max dismounts
          and opens the door.

                            NORMA
                      (taking Gillis's hand)
                 Don't you want to come along,
                 darling?

                            GILLIS
                 I don't think so.  It's your
                 script.  It's your show.
                 Good luck.

                            NORMA
                 Thank you, darling.

          She presses his hand against her cheek, descends
          from the car and walks toward -

  D-12    THE DOOR OF STAGE 18

          The first assistant is holding it open.  In the door-
          way stands Mr. deMille.  Seeing Norma, he stretches
          out his arms.

                              DE MILLE
                   Hello, young fellow.

                              NORMA
                   Hello, Mr. deMille.

          She has reached him.  They embrace.

                              NORMA
                   Last time I saw you was someplace
                   very gay.  I remember waving to you.
                   I was dancing on a table.

                             DE MILLE
                  Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had
                  just landed in Paris.  Come on in.

          He leads her into


  D-13    STAGE 18

          During the ensuing dialogue, Mr. deMille walks Norma
          towards the set.

                              DE MILLE
                   Norma, I want to apologize for
                   not calling you.

                              NORMA
                   You'd better.  I'm very angry.

                              DE MILLE
                   I'm pretty busy, as you can see...

                              NORMA
                   That's no excuse.  You read the
                   script, didn't you?

                              DE MILLE
                   Yes, I did.

                              NORMA
                   Then you could have picked up the
                   phone yourself instead of leaving
                   it to one of your assistants.

                              DE MILLE
                   What assistant?

                             NORMA
                  Don't play innocent.  Somebody
                  named Gordon Cole.

                             DE MILLE
                  Gordon Cole?

                             NORMA
                  And if you hadn't been pretty
                  darned interested in that script,
                  he wouldn't have tried to get
                  me on the phone ten times.

                             DE MILLE
                  Gordon Cole... Look, Norma,
                  I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.
                       (Indicating his
                        own chair)
                  Make yourself comfortable.

          He walks onto the set, accompanied by his assistants.

                             DE MILLE
                       (Sotto voce, to his
                        first assistant)
                  Get me Gordon Cole on the phone.

          Meanwhile, Norma starts to sit, sees the name
          MISS LAMARR on the chair and with a look of
          distaste changes and sits on the one marked
          C.B. DE MILLE.    From somewhere comes

                             A VOICE
                  Hey, Miss Desmond! Miss Desmond!

          She looks around her.

                           VOICE
                Up here!

          Norma looks up at the scaffolding.

          On the scaffold stands one of the electricians,
          next to his light.

                           ELECTRICIAN
                It's met It's Hog-eyel

          Norma waves at him.

                           NORMA
                Hello.

          Hog-eye points his light at her.

                           HOG-EYE
                Let's get a look at you.

          The beam of the lamp moves toward Norma.  It hits
          her.  She sits bathed in light.  A couple of old
          costume extras recognize her.

                           EXTRAS
                Say, it's Norma! Norma Desmond!

          They rush over and start wringing her hand.  Into
          the shot comes a middle-aged hairdresser.

                           HAIRDRESSER
                Hello, Miss Desmond.  It's Bessie.

          Some elderly electricians and stagehands move in.


  D-14    ANOTHER PART OF THE STAGE

          The first assistant brings the portable phone to
          deMille.  DeMille lifts the receiver.

                           DE MILLE
                Hello.


  D-15    GORDON COLE'S OFFICE IN THE PROPERTY DEPARTMENT,
          GORDON COLE ON THE PHONE.

                           COLE
                Prop Department.  Gordon Cole speaking.

  D-16    DE MILLE ON THE PHONE

                            DE MILLE
                 Cole, this is C. B. deMille.  Have
                 you been calling Norma Desmond?...
                 What's it about?


  D-17    GORDON COLE, ON THE PHONE

                            COLE
                 It's that car of hers -- an old
                 Isotta-Fraschini.  Her chauffeur
                 drove it on the lot the other day.
                 It looks just right for the Crosby
                 picture.  We want to rent it for a
                 couple of weeks.


  D-18    DE MILLE ON THE PHONE

                            DE MILLE
                      (Troubled)
                 Oh.  Well, thank you.

          He hangs up, walks back towards Norma.  (CAMERA
          WITH HIM).

          Norma stills sits in the shaft of light, surrounded
          by about a dozen people who have come up to pay court.
          DeMille gestures up to Hog-eye and the light shifts
          away.  The people about Norma disperse slowly with
          various ad-libs.

                            DE MILLE
                 Well, Norma ...
                      (He sits down next to her)
                 I got hold of Gordon Cole.

          Norma hasn't heard a word.

                            NORMA
                 Did you see them? Did you see
                 how they came?

                            DE MILLE
                 You know, crazy things happen in
                 this business.  I hope you haven't
                 lost your sense of humor ...

          Suddenly he realizes that she is crying.  She takes
          the handkerchief from his pocket and puts it over her
          eyes.

                            DEMILLE
                 What's the matter, Norma?

                            NORMA
                 Nothing.  I just didn't realize
                 what it would be like to come back
                 to the old studio.  I had no idea
                 how I'd missed it.

                            DEMILLE
                 We've missed you too, dear.

                            NORMA
                 We'll be working again, won't we, Chief?
                 We'll make our greatest picture.

                            DEMILLE
                 That's what I want to talk to you about.

                            NORMA
                 It's a good script, isn't it?

                            DEMILLE
                 It's got a lot of good things.  Of
                 course, it would be an expensive picture...

                            NORMA
                 I don't care about the money.
                 I just want to work again.  You
                 don't know what it means to know
                 that you want me.

                            DEMILLE
                 Nothing would thrill me more --
                 if it were possible.

                            NORMA
                 But remember, darling -- I don't
                 work before ten in the morning,
                 and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.

          The first assistant comes up.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.

                            DEMILLE
                 You'll pardon me, Norma? Why
                 don't you just sit and watch?
                      (He steps onto the set)
                 O.K.  Here we go.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 Roll 'em.

                            DEMILLE
                 Action!
          The scene starts.

  D-19    THE ISOTTA, PARKED OUTSIDE STAGE 18

          Max stands talking to Gillis, who is seated in the
          car.

                            MAX
                      (Pointing to the row
                       of offices in the
                       building opposite)
                 You see those offices there, Mr.
                 Gillis? They used to be her
                 dressing room, The whole row.

                            GILLIS
                 That didn't leave much for Wallace
                 Reid.

                            MAX
                 He had a great big bungalow on
                 wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See
                 where it says 'Readers' Department'?
                 I remember my walls were covered
                 with black patent leather...

          The words "Readers' Department" have registered on
          Gillis' mind.  He gets out of the car.

                            GILLIS
                 I'll be with you in a minute.

          He crosses the street towards the green staircase
          leading to the second floor.

          Meanwhile, two prop men walking down the street
          come into the SHOT.

                            1ST PROP MAN
                 Hey, that's the comic car Cole
                 was talking about!
                       (To Max)
                 Do you mind if we look inside?

                            MAX
                 Go away.  Go away.


  D-2O    CUBICLE IN THE READERS' DEPARTMENT

          Behind the desk sits Betty, typing the synopsis of
          a novel, a half-eaten apple marking her place.  The
          door behind her opens and Gillis enters.

                            GILLIS
                 Just so you don't think I'm a
                 complete swine -- if there's
                 anything in Dark Windows you
                 can use, take it.  It's all
                 yours.

                            BETTY
                 Well, for heaven's sake!

          She moves the book and the apple aside and points at
          the free space on the desk.

                            BETTY
                 Have a chair.

          Gillis sits on the desk.

                            GILLIS
                 I mean it.  It's no good to me
                 anyway.  Help yourself.

                            BETTY
                 Why should you do that?

                            GILLIS
                 If you get a hundred thousand for
                 it, you buy me a box of chocolate
                 creams.  If you get an Oscar, I
                 get the left foot.

                            BETTY
                 You know, I'd take you up on that
                 in a minute.  I'm just not good
                 enough to do it all by myself.

                            GILLIS
                 What about all those ideas you had?

                            BETTY
                 See if they make sense.  To begin
                 with, I think you should throw out
                 all that psychological stuff --
                 exploring a killer's sick mind.

                            GILLIS
                 Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

                            BETTY
                 This story is about teachers --
                 their threadbare lives, their
                 struggles.  Here are people doing
                 the most important job in the
                 world, and they have to wprry
                 about getting enough money to
                 re-sole their shoes.  To me it
                 can be as exciting as any chase,
                 any gunplay.

                            GILLIS
                 Check.

                            BETTY
                 Now I see her teaching day classes
                 while he teaches night school.  The
                 first time they meet ...

          From below comes the SOUND of the Isotta's horn.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, if you don't mind, I haven't
                 got time to listen to the whole
                 plot ...

                            BETTY
                 I'll make it short.

                            GILLIS
                 Sorry.  It's your baby now.

                            BETTY
                 I'm not good enough to write it
                 alone.  We'll have to do it together.

                            GILLIS
                 I'm all tied up.  I can't.

                            BETTY
                 Couldn't we work in the evenings?
                 Six o'clock in the morning? This
                 next month I'm completely at your
                 disposal.  Artie is out of town.

                            GILLIS
                 What has Artie to do with it.

                            BETTY
                 We're engaged.

                            GILLIS
                 Good for you.  You've got yourself
                 the best guy in town.

                            BETTY
                 I think so.  They're on location
                 in Arizona, shooting a Western.
                 I'm free every evening, every week-
                 end.  If you want, we could work at
                 your place.

                            GILLIS
                 It's just impossible.

                            BETTY
                 Nobody can be that busy.

          There is another honk: from down below.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, Betty, It can't be done.
                 It's out.

                            BETTY
                 You're tough, all right.

                            GILLIS
                 You're on your own.  Stop being
                 chicken-hearted and write that story.

                            BETTY
                 Honest to goodness, I hate you.

                            GILLIS
                      (Turning 1n the open door)
                 And don't make it too dreary.  How
                 about this for a situation: she
                 teaches daytimes.  He teaches at
                 night.  Right?  They don't even know
                 each other, but they share the same
                 room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a
                 matter of fact, they sleep in the
                 same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.

                            BETTY
                 Are you kidding? Because I think
                 it's good.

                            GILLIS
                 So do I.

                            BETTY
                 Came  on back.  Let me show you
                 where it fits in.

          She reaches in a drawer for her notes on Dark
          Windows.

                            GILLIS
                       (At the door)
                 So long.

          Betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it
          after him.

                            BETTY
                 Oh, you --

                            GILLIS
                 And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR
                 THE TEACHER.

          He ducks out quiokly, slamming the door behind him.
          Betty looks after him, then angrlly hurls the
          apple into the wastebasket.


  D-21    STAIRCASE OUTSIDE READERS' DEPARTMENT

          Max is rush1ng up the stairs toward the descending
          Gillis.

                            GILLIS
                 What's the matter, Max?

                            MAX
                 I just found out why all those tele-
                 phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond
                 they want.  It is the car they want
                 to rent.

                            GILLIS
                 What?

          Max has seen something off.

                            MAX
                 Ssh...

          With his head he indicates


  D-22    ENTRANCE TO STAGE 18

          The first assistant has opened the door.  DeMille
          is showing Norma out.

                            DE MILLE
                 Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see
                 what we can do.

                            NORMA
                      (embracing him)
                 I'm not worried.  Everything will
                 be fine.  The old team together.
                 Nothing can stop us.

          She turns and walks out of the shot.  De Mille
          stands for a second watching her, then turns to
          his assistant.

                            DE MILLE
                 Get Gordon Cole.  Tell him to forget
                 about her car.  He can find another
                 old car.  I'll buy him five old cars,
                 if necessary.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 Yes, Mr. De Mille.

          They turn back into Stage 18.

  D-23    THE ISOTTA

          Gillis seated in the rear.  Max is helping Norma
          in and putting the robe over her.

                           GILLIS
                      (Apprehensively)
                How did it go?

                           NORMA
                It couldn't have gone better.
                It's practically set.  Of course,
                he has to finish this picture
                first, but mine will be his next.

          There is an exchange of looks between Max and Gillis.

                           GILLIS
                He must be quite a guy.

                           NORMA
                He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can
                smell box office.  Only I'm going
                to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't
                going to be C. B. deMille's Salome.
                It's going to be Norma Desmond's
                Salome, a Norma Desmond Production,
                starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.

                           MAX
                Yes, Miss Desmond.

          As he says the words, he and Gillis exchange a glance
          in the rear view mirror.

  E-3     NORMA BEFORE THE MIRROR
          IN HER BEDROOM

          It is nine o'clock in the evening.  She is in night
          gown and negligee and has put triangular patches on
          the saddle of her nose and at the outer corner of
          each eye.  She is rubbing lotion on her hands.

          She gets up and crosses to the door of Gillis' room
          and opens it a crack.

                             NORMA
                   Joe darling, are you there?

  E-4     GILLIS' ROOM

          It is dark except for a lamp over the chaise longue.
          Gillis lies on it, fully clothed, reading a book.

                             GILLIS
                   Yes, Norma.

          Through the slit in the door there is a suggestion
          of Norma.

                             NORMA
                  Don't turn around.  Keep your
                  eyes on the book.

                             GILLIS
                  Yes, Norma.

          Norma pushes the door open and comes in.

                             NORMA
                  I just came to say good night.
                  I don't want you to see me --
                  I'm not very attractive.

                             GILLIS
                  Good night.

                             NORMA
                  I've lost half a pound since
                  Tuesday.

                             GILLIS
                  Good.

                             NORMA
                  I was a little worried about the
                  line of my throat.  This woman
                  has done wonders with it.

                             GILLIS
                  Good.

                             NORMA
                  You'd better get to bed yourself.

                             GILLIS
                  I think I'll read a little.

                             NORMA
                  You went out last night, didn't
                  you, Joe?

                             GILLIS
                  Why do you say that?

                             NORMA
                  I just happen to know it.  I had
                  a nightmare and I screamed for
                  you.  You weren't here.  Where
                  were you?

                             GILLIS
                  I went for a walk.

                             NORMA
                  No you didn't.  You took the
                  car.

                             GILLIS
                  All right, I drove to the beach.
                  Norma, you don't want me to feel
                  I'm locked up in this house?

                             NORMA
                  Of course not, Joe.  It's just
                  that I don't want to be left alone.
                  Not now, while I'm under this
                  terrible strain.  My nerves are
                  being torn apart.  All I ask is
                  for you to be a little patient and a
                  little kind.

                             GILLIS
                  I haven't done anything, Norma.

                             NORMA
                  Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't
                  let you.

          She bends and kisses the top of his head.

                             NORMA
                  Good night, my darling.

          She goes into her room, shutting the door behind her.

          Gillis puts his book down and looks at her door.

          BOOM MOVES FORWARD to the only     So we'd started
          two lights.  They are the door     working on it, the
          and window of Betty Schaefer's     two of us.  Nights,
          cubicle.  Betty sits at the        when the studio was
          desk, typing.  Gillis, his         deserted, up in her
          coat off, his shirt-sleeves        little cubby-hole
          rolled up, j.s pacing the floor,   of an office.
          discussing the construction of
          a sentence.  The discussion at
          a stalemate, Betty suggests
          some coffee.  Gillis agrees.
          From the electric plate on the
          shelf beside her, Betty takes
          a glass coffee machine.  Gillis
          seats himself in her chair
          and starts typing.

          Betty opens the door and comes out on the balcony to
          fill the coffee machine from the water cooler stand-
          ing beside the door.

                             BETTY
                   I got the funniest letter from
                   Artie.  It's rained every day
                   since they got to Arizona.  They
                   re-wrote the whole picture for
                   rain and shot half of it.  Now
                   the sun is out.  Nobody knows
                   when they'll get back.

          She moves back into the room.

                             GILLIS
                   Good.

                             BETTY
                   What's good about it?  I miss
                   him something fierce.

                             GILLIS
                   I mean this is good dialogue
                   along in here.  It'll play.

                             BETTY
                   It will?

                             GILLIS
                   Sure.  Especially with lots
                   of music underneath, drowning
                   it out.

                             BETTY
                   Don't you sometimes hate yourself?

                             GILLIS
                   Constantly.  No, in all serious-
                   ness, it's really good.  It's
                   fun writing again.  I'm happy
                   here, honest I am.

          He resumes typing.  Betty puts the water on.  She
          picks up a pack of cigarettes on the desk, finds it's
          empty and throws it away, sees Gillis' open gold
          cigarette case and lighter on the table by the couch.
          Betty reaches for a cigarette.  The inscription en-
          graved inside the case catches her eye.  It reads:

                            MAD ABOUT THE BOY --

                   Who's who?

                             BETTY
                   I'm sorry.  I don't usually
                   read private cigarette cases.

                             GILLIS
                   Oh, that.  It's from a friend
                   of mine.  A middle-aged lady,
                   very foolish and very generous.

                             BETTY
                   I'll say.  This is solid gold.

                             GILLIS
                   I gave her some advice on an
                   idiotic script.

                             BETTY

  E-12    PARAMOUNT'S NEW YORK STREET (NIGHT)

          Betty and Gillis are walking down it, THE CAMERA
          AHEAD OF THEM.

                             BETTY
                   Look at this street.  All card-
                   board, all hollow, all phoney.
                   All done with mirrors.  I like
                   it better than any street in the
                   world.  Maybe because I used to
                   play here when I was a kid.

                             GILLIS
                   What were you -- a child actress?

                             BETTY
                   I was born just two blocks from
                   this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove
                   Avenue.  Father was head elec-
                   trician here till he died.  Mother
                   still works in Wardrobe.

                             GILLIS
                   Second generation, huh?

                             BETTY
                   Third.  Grandma did stunt work
                   for Pearl White.  I come from a
                   picture family.  Naturally they
                   took it for granted I was to become
                   a great star.  So I had ten years of
                   dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.
                   Then the studio made a test.  Well,
                   they didn't like my nose -- it slanted
                   this way a little.  I went to a doctor
                   and had it fixed.  They made more
                   tests, and they were crazy about my
                   nose -- only they didn't like my acting.

                             GILLIS
                      (Examining her nose
                       by the flame of his
                       lighter)
                   Nice job.

                             BETTY
                   Should be.  It cost three hundred
                   dollars.

                             GILLIS
                   Saddest thing I ever heard.

                             BETTY
                   Not at all.  It taught me a little
                   sense.  I got me a job in the mail
                   room, worked up to the Stenographic.
                   Now I'm a reader...

                             GILLIS
                   Come clean, Betty.  At night you
                   weep for those lost closeups, those
                   gala openings...

                             BETTY
                   Not once.  What's wrong with being
                   on the other side of the cameras?
                   It's really more fun.

                             GILLIS
                   Three cheers for Betty Schaefer!
                   I will now kiss that nose of yours.

                             BETTY
                   If you please.

          Gillis kisses her nose.  As he stands there, his
          face close to hers -

                             GILLIS
                   May I say you smell real special.

                             BETTY
                   It must be my new shampoo.

                             GILLIS
                   That's no shampoo.  It'smore like
                   a pile of freehly laundred hand-
                   kerchiefs, like a brand new auto-
                   mobile.  How old are you anyway?

                 That's it -- there's nothing like
                 being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest
                 that if we're ever to finish this
                 story you keep at least two feet
                 away from me ...  Now back to the
                 typewriter.

          They start walking in the direction of the office.

  E-13    THE GARAGE

          Gillis gets out.  From the seat next him he takes a
          batch of script, folds it and puts it in his pocket.
          He suddenly becomes aware that he is watched, turns.
          Max stands in the moonlight, evidently waiting for
          him.

                            GILLIS
                 What is it, Max? Want to wash
                 the car, or are you doing a little
                 spying in your off hours?

                            MAX
                 You must be very careful as you
                 cross the patio.  Madame may be
                 watching.

                            GILLIS
                 How about my going up the kitchen
                 stairs and undressing in the dark.
                 Will that do it?

                            MAX
                 I'm not inquiring where Mr.
                 Gillis goes every night...

                            GILLIS
                 Why don't you? I'm writing a
                 script and I'm dying to finish
                 it, no matter what.

                            MAX
                 It's just that I'm very worried
                 about Madame.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure you are.  And we're not help-
                 ing her any, feeding her lies and
                 more lies.  Getting herself ready
                 for a pioture ...  What happens when
                 she finds out?

                            MAX
                 She never will.  That is my job.
                 It has been for a long time.  You
                 must understand I discovered her
                 when she was eighteen.  I made her
                 a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.

                            GILLIS
                 You made her a star?

                            MAX
                 I directed all her early pictures.
                 There were three young directors
                 who showed promise in those days:
                 D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and
                 Max von Mayerling.

                            GILLIS
                 And she's turned you into a
                 servant.

                            MAX
                 It was I who asked to come back,
                 humiliating as it may seem.  I
                 could have gone on witn my career,
                 only I found everything unendur-
                 able arter she divorced me.  You
                 see, I was her rirst husband.

          the door to:

          Gillis lies in bed asleep, Norma in the doorway.

          Her eyes fall on Gillis' coat, which hangs over a
          chair.  In a pocket is part of the script.  Norma
          takes it out, looks at it.  She can't see it in the

          Carrying the script Norma goes to the lamp and looks

          Betty is typing.  Gillis sits on the couch, proof-
          reading a scene.  Betty stops typing and Gillis
          becomes aware of her eyes fixed on him.

                            GILLIS
                 Hey, what's the matter...
                 Betty, wake up!
                     (He whistles and
                      catches her attention)
                 Why are you staring at me like that?

                            BETTY
                 Was I?  I'm sorry.

                            GILLIS
                 What's wrong with you tonight?
                 What is it, Betty?

                            BETTY
                 Something came up.  I don't want
                 to talk about it.

                            GILLIS
                 Why not?

                            BETTY
                 I just don't.

                 on, let's have it.

                 Is it about me?

          Betty doesn't answer, walks out on


  E-18    THE BALCONY

          She leans against a post, crying.  Gillis comes out
          after her.

                            GILLIS
                 Betty, there's no use running
                 out on it.  Let's face it, what-
                 ever it is.

                            BETTY
                 It's nothing.  I got a telegram
                 from Artie.

                            GILLIS
                 From Artie.  What's wrong?

                            BETTY
                 He wants me to come on to Arizona.
                 He says it only oosts two dollars
                 to get married there.  It would
                 kind of save us a honeymoon.

                            GILLIS
                 Why don't you? We can finish the
                 script by Thursday.

          Betty stands crying silently.

                            GILLIS
                 Stop crying.  You're getting
                 married.  That's what you've
                 always wanted.

                 I don't want it now.

                             GILLIS
                   Why not? Don't you love Artie?

                             BETTY
                   Of course I love him.  I always
                   will.  I'm just not in love
                   with him any more.

                             GILLIS

                            BETTY
                 No, I'll be all right.

          She shuts the door of the car and goes up the steps.


  E-30    NORMA'S BEDROOM

          Norma lies on the bed.  Gillis sits in a far corner
          of the room, motionless.

                            NORMA
                      (In a whimpering monotone)
                 I love you, Joe.  I love you, Joe.
                 I love you, Joe.  I love you, Joe.

          There is the sound of footsteps below and the ringing
          of a doorbell.  Gillis rises.

                            NORMA
                 What are you going to do, Joe?

          Without a word, he leaves the room.  Norma raises
          herself on the bed, reaching for a black negligee
          lying at the foot of it.  As she does so, she dis-
          lodges her pillow a little, revealing a revolver
          hidden beneath it.


  E-31    DOWNSTAIRS HALL, THE DESMOND HOUSE (DARK)

          Max crosses the hall, putting on his alpaca jacket.
          He turns on the lights.  Outside stands Betty.
          From the staircase comes -

                            GILLIS' VOICE
                 It's all right, Max.  I'll take it.

                            MAX
                 Yes, sir.

          He stands back as Gillis opens the door.

                            GILLIS
                 Hello, Betty.

                            BETTY
                      (On the threshold)
                 I don't know why I'm so scared,
                 Joe.  Is it something awful?

                            GILLIS
                 Come on in, Betty,

          Betty enters.  As he leads her into the living room,
          Gillis puts his arm around her shoulders.

                            GILLIS
                 Ever been in one of these old
                 Hollywood palazzos? That's from
                 when they were making eighteen thou-
                 sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful
                 of these tiles, they're slippery.
                 Valentino used to dance here.

                            BETTY
                 This is where you live?

                            GILLIS
                 You bet.

                            BETTY
                 Whose house is it?

          They have reached


  E-32    THE LIVING ROOM

          Gillis leads Betty in.

                            GILLIS
                 Hers.

                            BETTY
                 Whose?

                            GILLIS
                 Just look around.  There's a lot
                 of her spread about.  If you don't
                 remember the face, you must have
                 heard the name of Norma Desmond.

                            BETTY
                 That was Norma Desmond on the phone?

                            GILLIS
                 Want something to drink?  There's
                 always champagne on ice, and plenty
                 of caviar.

                            BETTY
                 Why did she call me?

                            GILLIS
                 Jealous.  Ever see so much junk?
                 She had the ceiling brought from
                 Portugal.  Look at this.

          He pulls the rope, showing the projection screen
          under the picture.

                            GILLIS
                 Her own movie theatre.

                            BETTY
                 I didn't come here to see a house.
                 What about Norma Desmond?

                            GILLIS
                 I'm trying to tell you.  This is
                 an enormous place.  Eight master
                 bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every
                 bathroom.  There's a bowling alley
                 in the cellar.  It's lonely here,
                 so she got herself a companion.
                 A very simple set-up: An older
                 woman who is well-to-do.  A younger
                 man who is not doing too well ...
                 Can you figure it out yourself?

                            BETTY
                 No.

                            GILLIS
                 All right.  I'll give you a few
                 more clues.

                            BETTY
                 No, no! I haven't heard any of
                 this.  I never got those telephone
                 calls.  I've never been in this
                 house ... Get your things together.
                 Let's get out of here.

                            GILLIS
                 All my things? All the eighteen
                 suits, all the custom-made shoes and
                 the eighteen dozen shirts, and the
                 cuff-links and the platinum key-
                 chains, and the cigarette cases?

                            BETTY
                 Come on, Joe.

                            GILLIS
                 Come on where? Back to a one-room
                 apartment that I can't pay for?
                 Back to a story that may sell and
                 very possibly will not?

                            BETTY
                 If you love me, Joe.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, sweetie -- be practical.
                 l've got a good thing here.
                 A long-term contract with no options.
                 I like it that way.  Maybe it's not
                 very admirable.  Well, you and Artie
                 can be admirable.

                            BETTY
                 Joe, I can't look at you any more.

                            GILLIS
                 Nobody asked you to.

          Betty turns from him, to hide the fact that she is
          crying.

                            GILLIS
                 All right, baby.  This way out.

          He leads her in the direction of the door.

  E-33    UPPER LANDING, DESMOND HOUSE

          Sitting crouched behind the balustrade is Norma,
          peering down into


  E-34    THE LOWER HALL

          Betty and Gillis have reached the entrance door.
          Gillis opens it.

                            GILLIS
                 Good luck to you, Betty.  You can
                 finish that story on the way to
                 Arizona.  When you and Artie get
                 back, if the two of you ever feel
                 like a swim, here's the pool ...

          He switches on the light.


  E-35    THE PATIO

          The lights go on in the pool, which shines brilliant-
          ly in the dark garden.


  E-36    BETTY

          She doesn't even look.  Her eyes filled with tears,
          she runs down the entrance porch toward her car.


  E-37    THE ENTRANCE HALL

          Gillis looks after her, closes the door.  From the
          upper landing comes the sound of soft sobbing.  He
          looks up.


  E-38    NORMA, ON THE UPPER LANDING

          Gillis ascends the stairs.

                            NORMA
                 Thank you, Joe -- thank you, Joe.

          She tries to take his hand to kiss it as he passes.
          He doesn't stop.  Norma catches his coat.  Gillis
          moves right on into his room.  Norma lies on the
          floor looking after him.  She crawls toward a con-
          sole, pulls herself up by it, starts towards Gillis'
          door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves
          back to the mirror and takes the patches off her
          face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with
          her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor
          travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis'
          room.

                            NORMA
                 May I come in?  I've stopped cry-
                 ing.  I'm all right again.  Joe,
                 tell me you're not cross -- tell
                 me everything is just as it was,
                 Joe.

          She opens the door.


  E-39    GILLIS' ROOM

          In the foreground, open on the bed, is a half-packed
          suitcase, Gillis just putting some of his old shirts
          in.  Norma stands staring, speechless, for a second.
          Gillis moves out of the shot towards the closets.

                            NORMA
                 What are you doing, Joe?  What
                 are you doing?  You're not leaving
                 me?

                            GILLIS
                 Yes, I am, Norma.

                            NORMA
                 No, you're not.
                      (Calling)
                 Max! Max!

                            GILLIS
                 Max is a good idea.  He can help
                 with my luggage.
                      (He gestures in the
                       direction of the closet)
                 Thanks for letting me wear the
                 handsome wardrobe.  And thanks
                 for the use of all the trinkets.

          He takes the cigarette case and throws it on the
          chaise longue.  Then he throws the lighter, the
          wrist watch, the platinum key-chain and the tie clip.

                            GILLIS
                      (Indicating the bureau)
                 The rest of the jewelry is in the
                 top drawer.

                            NORMA
                 It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to
                 you.

                            GILLIS
                 And I'd take it in a second, Norma --
                 only it's a little too dressy for
                 sitting behind the copy desk in
                 Dayton, Ohio.

                            NORMA
                 These are nothing.  You can have
                 anything you want if you'll only
                 stay.  What is it you want --
                 money?

                            GILLIS
                 Norma, you'd be throwing it away.
                 I don't qualify for the job, not any
                 more.

                            NORMA
                 You can't do this!  Max!  Max!
                 ... I can't face life without you,
                 and I'm not afraid to die, you
                 know.

                            GILLIS
                 That's between you and yourself,
                 Norma.

                            NORMA
                 You think I made that up about
                 the gun...

          She rushes into her room.  Gillis closes the suitcase
          calmly, notices that he is still wearing some cuff-
          links Norma gave him, takes them off.

          Norma reappears in the door, carrying the revolver.

                            NORMA
                 See, you didn't believe me!..
                 Now I suppose you don't think I
                 have the courage!

                            GILLIS
                 Oh.  sure -- if it would make a
                 good scene.

                            NORMA
                 You don't care.  do you?  But
                 hundreds of thousands of people
                 will carel

                            GILLIS
                 Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing
                 yourself to an empty house.  The
                 audience left twenty years ago.
                 Now face it.

          During the preceding.  Max has entered.  He stands
          listening, paralyzed.

                             NORMA
                  That's a lie!  They still want me!

                             GILLIS
                  No, they don't.

                             NORMA
                  What about the studio?
                  What about De Mille?

                             GILLIS
                  He was trying to spare your feelings.
                  The studio wanted to rent your car.

                             NORMA
                  Wanted what?

                             GILLIS
                  De Mille didn't have the heart
                  to tell you.  None of us has had
                  the heart.

                             NORMA
                  That's a lie!  They want me, they
                  want me!  I get letters every day!

                             GILLIS
                  You tell her, Max.  Come on, do
                  her that favor.  Tell her there
                  isn't going to be any picture --
                  there aren't any fan letters,
                  except the ones you write yourself.

                             NORMA
                  That isn't true! Max?

                             MAX
                  Madame is the greatest star of
                  them all...  I will take Mr.
                  Gillis' bags.

          He leaves.

                             NORMA
                  You heard him.  I'm a star!

                             GILLIS
                  Norma, grow up.  You're a woman
                  of fifty.  There's nothing tragic
                  about being fifty - not unless
                  you try to be twenty-five.

                             NORMA
                   I'm the greatest star of them
                   all.

                             GILLIS
                   Goodbye.  Norma.

                             NORMA
                   No one leaves a star.  That
                   makes one a star.

          Gillis picks up the typewriter and leaves.

                             NORMA
                   You're not leaving me!


  E-40    STAIRCASE

          Gillis descending with the typewriter.

                             NORMA'S VOICE
                   Joe! ...Joe!

          There is the SOUND OF A SHOT.  The glass of the front
          door is shattered.  Gillis at the door opens it and
          walks out, without looking back.

          Down the staircase rushes Norma.  a disordered wild-
          ness in the way she moves.

                             NORMA
                   You're not leaving me!

          She hurries after Gillis.


  E-41    PATIO (NIGHT)

          Dark except for lights from the house and the
          luminousness of the lit pool.

          Gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage.  He
          is carrying the typewriter.  He doesn't accelerate
          his step, although he has heard the shot.  Behind
          him Norma comes from the lighted house.

                             NORMA
                   You're not leaving me!

          She shoots twice in rapid succession.  Gillis drops
          the typewriter.  The shots have swung him around.  He
          is now facing Norma.  She shoots him.  This shot
          hits him in the belly.  He doubles up, instinctively
          backs away from her, plummets into the lit pool.

          Up the stone steps from the garage rushes Max.
          He sees the situation, hurries towards Norma, who
          stands exultant in the strange light from the pool.

                             NORMA
                   Stars are ageless, aren't they?

          DISSOLVE TO:


  E-42    THE PATIO

          Dawn is breaking.  At the edge of the pool
          stand policemen, detectives and police photographers.
          Motorcycle policemen are holding off the mob which
          is trying to storm the house.

          A lietuenant from the Homicide Bureau leaves the
          crowd around the pool and goes into


  E-43    THE LOWER HALL, DESMOND HOUSE

          It is filled with a pandemonium of police officers,
          newspaper people, etc.  who are kept from the upper
          floor by two policemen at the head of the stairs.
          The lieutenant from the Homicide Bureau goes
          through the crowd to the telephone at the foot of
          the stairs, picks up the phone and dials.

                             LIEUTENANT
                   Coroner's office? ... I want to
                   speak to the Coroner ... Who's
                   on this phone?


  E-44    THE WHITE TELEPHONE IN NORMA'S BEDROOM

          Standing talking into it is Hedda Hopper.

                             MISS HOPPER
                   I am! Now get off, this is more

                   over the murder house, Norma Desmond,
                   famed star of yesteryear, is in
                   a state of complete mental shock ...

          THE CAMERA PANS TO ANOTHER PART OF THE BEDROOM, where
          Norma sits at a mirror, staring at herself blankly.
          Firing questions at her are the Captain of the Holmby
          Hills Division and the L.A.  Homicide Squad.  Max
          stands by faithfully.

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                  You do not deny having killed
                  this man, Miss Desmond?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                  Did you intend to kill him?
                  Just answer me that.

                  Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there
                  been any trouble between you before?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                  If it was a quarrel, how come you
                  had the gun right there?

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                  This guy -- where did you meet him
                  for the first time?  Where did he
                  come from? Who is he?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                  Did he have a wife?  Did he had a
                  girl friend?  Did you know them?

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                  Had he been trying to blackmail you?

  E-46    NORMA'S BEDROOM

          The interrogators are still firing questions at Norma
          who sits lifeless, staring at herself.  Max watches.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Did the deceased ever threaten you?
                 Were you in fear of bodily injury?

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                 Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought
                 of doing something like this before?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Was theft involved?  Did you catch
                 him trying to steal something, or
                 find he had stolen something?

          A police lieutenant has entered, goes to the Head of
          Homicide.

                            LIEUTENANT
                 The newsreel guys have arrived with
                 the cameras.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Tell them to go fly a kite.  This
                 is no time for cameras.

          A word has pierced the mists that surround Norma.

                            NORMA
                 Cameras? ...What is it, Max?

                            MAX
                 The cameras have arrived, Madame.

                            NORMA
                 They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell
                 Mr. DeMille I will be on the set
                 at once.

          Max flashes a look at the Head of Homicide.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 What is this?

                            MAX
                 Please ...

                      (sotto voce, to Head of Homicide)
                 Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Okay.  And let's have the car right
                 outside.

                 You will pardon me, gentlemen.
                 I have to get ready for my scene.

          She takes a comb and runs it through her hair, then
          starts applying some wild makeup.


  E-47    STAIRCASE AND LOWER HALL

          Max makes his way down the stairs through the crowd
          of newsmen to the newsreel cameras, which are being
          set up in the hall below.

                            MAX
                  Is everything set up, gentlemen?
                  Are the lights ready?

          From the stairway comes a murnur.  They look up.

          Norma has emerged from the bedroom and comes to the
          head of the stairs.  There are golden spangles in
          her hair and in her hand she carries a golden scarf.

          The police clear a path for her to descend.  Press
          cameras flash at her every step.

          Max stands at the cameras.

                            MAX
                  Is everything set up, gentlemen?

                            CAMERAMAN
                  Just about.

          The portable lights flare up and illuminate the
          staircase.

                            MAX
                  Are the lights ready?

                  All set.

                            MAX
                  Quiet, everybody!  Lights!
                  Are you ready, Norma?

                            NORMA

                       stairs)
                  What is the scene? Where am I?

                            MAX
                  This is the staircase of the palace.

                             NORMA
                 Oh, yes, yes.  They're below,
                 waiting for the Princess ...
                 I'm ready.

                             MAX
                 All right.
                      (To cameramen)
                 Camera!

                                        her...

          At the foot of the stairs Norma stops, moved.

                            NORMA
                 I can't go on with the scene.
                 I'm too happy.  Do you mind,
                 Mr. DeMille, if I say a few words?
                 Thank you.  I just want to tell
                 you how happy I am to be back in
                 the studio making a picture again.
                 You don't know how much I've missed
                 all of you.  And I promise you
                 I'll never desert you again, because
                 after "Salome" we'll make another
                 picture, and another and another.
                 You see, this is my life.  It always
                 will be.  There's nothing else -
                 just us and the cameras and those
                 wonderful people out there in the
                 dark...  All right, Mr. DeMille,
                 I'm ready for my closeup.

          FADE OUT.

                         SEQUENCE "A"  


  A-l-4   START the picture with the actual street sign:
          SUNSET BOULEVARD, stencilled on a curbstope.
          In the gutter lie dead leaves, scraps of paper,
          burnt matches and cigarette butts.  It is early
          morning.

          Now the CAMERA leaves the sign and MOVES EAST, the
          grey asphalt of the street filling the screen.  As
          speed accelerates to around 40 m.p.h., traffic de-
          marcations, white arrows, speed-limit warnings, man-

  A-8     JOE GILLIS' APARTMENT

          It is a one-room affair with an unmade Murphy bed
          pulled out of the wall at which Gillis sits typing.
          There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs and a
          Spanish-style, wrought-iron standing lamp.  Also a
          small desk littered with books and letters, and a
          chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some
          records on top.  On the walls are a couple of repro-
          ductions of characterless paintings, with laundry
          bills and snapshots stuck in the frames.  Through an
          archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette, complete with
          unwashed coffee pot and cup, empty tin cans, orange
          peels, etc.  The effect is dingy and cheerless --
          just another furnished apartment.  The buzzer SOUNDS.

                            GILLIS
                 Yeah.

          The buzzer SOUNDS again.  Gillis gets up and opens
          the door.  Two men wearing hats stand outside one of
          them carrying a briefcase.

          The men ease into the room.  No. 1 hands Gillis a

          DISSOLVE TO:

  A-11    SHELDRAKE'S OFFICE

          It is in the style of a Paramount executive's office --
          mahogany, leather, and a little chintz.  On the
          walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount
          stars, with dedications to Mr. Sheldrake.  Also a
          couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an
          Oscar on a bookshelf.  A shooting schedule chart is
          thumb-tacked into a large bulletin board.  There are
          piles or scripts, a few pipes and, somewhere in the
          background, some set models.

          Start on Sheldrake.  He is about 45.  Behind his wor-
          ried face there hides a coated tongue.  He is en-
          gaged in changing the stained rilter cigarette in
          his Zeus holder.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 All right, Gillis.  You've got
                 five minutes.  What's your story
                 about?

                            GILLIS
                 It's about a ball player, a rookie
                 shortstop that's batting 347.  The
                 poor kid was once mixed up in a hold-
                 up.  But he's trying to go straight --
                 except there's a bunch of gamblers
                 who won't let him.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 So they tell the kid to throw the
                 World Series, or else, huh?

                            GILLIS
                 More or less.  Only for the end
                 I've got a gimmick that's real good.

          A secretary enters, carrying a glass or milk.
          She opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for
          Sheldrake.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Got a title?

                            GILLIS
                 Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page
                 outline.

                 Get the Readers' Department and
                 see what they have on Bases Loaded.

          The secretary exits.  Sheldrake takes a pill and
          washes it down with some milk.

                            GILLIS
                 They're pretty hot about it
                 over at Twentieth, but I
                 think Zanuck's all wet.  Can
                 you see Ty Power as a

                 man for it right here on this lot.
                 Alan Ladd.  Good change of pace for
                 Alan Ladd.  There's another thing:
                 it's pretty simple to shoot.  Lot
                 of outdoor stuff.  Bet you could
                 make the whole thing for under a
                 million.  And there's a great little
                 part for Bill Demarest.  One of the
                 trainers, an oldtime player who
                 got beaned and goes out of his head
                 sometimes.

          The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean-
          cut, nice looking girl of 21, with a bright, alert
          manner.  Dressed in tweed skirt, Brooks sweater and
          pearls, and carrying a folder of papers.  She puts
          them on Sheldrake's desk, not noticing Gillis, who
          stands near the door.

                            BETTY
                 Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases
                 Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page
                 synopsis.
                      (She holds it out)
                 But I wouldn't bother.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 What's wrong with it?

                            BETTY
                 It's from hunger.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Nothing for Ladd?

                            BETTY
                 Just a rehash of something that
                 wasn't very good to begin with.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 I'm sure you'll be glad to meet
                 Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.

          Betty turns towards Gillis, embarrassed.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 This is Miss Kramer.

                            BETTY
                 Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And
                 right now I wish I could crawl
                 into a hole and pull it in after
                 me.

                            GILLIS
                 If I could be of any help...

                            BETTY
                 I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I
                 just don't think it's any good.
                 I found it flat and banal.

                            GILLIS
                 Exactly what kind of material do
                 you recommend?  James Joyce?
                 Dostoosvsky?

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Name dropper.

                            BETTY
                 I just think pictures should say
                 a little something.

                            GILLIS
                 Oh, you're one of the message
                 kids.  Just a story won't do.
                 You'd have turned down Gone With the
                 Wind.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 No, that was me.  I said, Who
                 wants to see a Civil War picture?

                            BETTY
                 Perhaps the reason I hated Bases
                 Loaded is that I knew your name.
                 I'd always heard you had some
                 talent.

                            GILLIS
                 That was last year.  This year
                 I'm trying to earn a living.

                            BETTY
                 So you take Plot 27-A, make it
                 glossy, make it slick --

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Carefull Those are dirty words!
                 You sound like a bunch of New
                 York critics.  Thank you, Miss
                 Schaefer.

                            BETTY
                 Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.

                            GILLIS
                 Goodbye.  Next time I'll write
                 The Naked and the Dead.


          Betty leaves.

                            SHELDRAKE
                 Well, seems like Zanuck's got
                 himself a baseball picture.

                            GILLIS
                 Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you
                 to think I thought this was going

                 There's nothing, Gillis.  Not
                 even if you were a relative.

                 Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you
                 let me have three hundred bucks
                 yourself, as a personal loan?

                             SHELDRAKE
                 Could I?  Gillis, last year some-
                 body talked me into buying a ranch
                 in the valley.  So I borrowed money
                 from the bank so I could pay for
                 the ranch.  This year I had to
                 mortgage the ranch so I could keep
                 up my life insurance so I could
                 borrow on the insurance so I could
                 pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey

          Gillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the

          He walks toward the exit.  He is stopped by the

          stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript
          opponent in the background.  Gillis has evidently
          stated his problem already.

                 So you need three hundred dollars?
                 Of course, I could give you three
                 hundred dollars.  Only I'm not

                 It's not the ten per cent.  I'm

          He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee,

                            MAX
                 You are not dressed properly.

                            GILLIS
                 Dressed for what?

                            THE WOMAN'S VOICE
                 Max!  Have him come up, Max!

                            MAX
                      (Gesturing)
                 Up the stairs!

                            GILLIS
                 Suppose you listen just for a
                 minute -

                            MAX
                 Madame is waiting.

                            GILLIS
                 For me?  Okay.

          Gillis enters.


  A-31    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ENTRANCE HALL

          It is grandiose and grim.  The whole place is one of
          those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling
          alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and
          beams imported from Italy, with California termites
          at work on them.  Portieres are drawn before all the
          windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their
          way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always
          burning.



          Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble
          staircase.  It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn
          velvet rope along the wall.

                            MAX
                      (From below)
                 If you need help with the
                 coffin call me.

          The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis'
          imagination.  He climbs the stairs with a kind of
          morbid fascination.  At the top he stops, undecided,
          then turns to the right and is stopped by

                            WOMAN'S VOICE
                 This way!

          Gillis swings around.

          Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a
          doorway from which emerges a flickering light.  She
          is a little woman.  There is a curious style, a
          great sense of high voltage about her.  She is dress-
          ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled
          pumps.  Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-
          terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of
          the same material.  Her skin is very pale, and she
          is wearing dark glasses.

                            NORMA
                 In here.  I put him on my massage
                 table in front of the fire.  He
                 always liked fires and poking at
                 them with a stick.

          Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into


  A-32    NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM

          It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which
          has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly
          torn in a few places.  There's a great, unmade gilded
          bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had
          begun to peel.  There is a disorder of clothes and
          negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars
          about.

          In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-
          ing.  On the massage table before it lies a small
          form shrouded under a Spanish shawl.  At each end on
          a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande-
          labrum, the candles lighted.

                            NORMA
                 I've made up my mind we'll bury him in
                 the garden.  Any city laws against that?


                            GILLIS
                 I wouldn't know.

                            NORMA
                 I don't care anyway.  I want the
                 coffin to be white.  And I want
                 it specially lined with satin.
                 White, or deep pink.

          She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the
          color.  From under the shawl flops down a dead arm.
          Gillis stares and recoils a little.  It is like a
          child's arm, only black and hairy.

                            NORMA
                 Maybe red.  bright flaming red.
                 Gay.  Let's make it gay.

          Gillis edges closer and glances down.  Under the
          shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead
          chimpanzee.  Norma drops back the shawl.

                            NORMA
                 How much will it be?  I warn you -
                 don't give me a fancy price just
                 because I'm rich.

                            GILLIS
                 Lady.  you've got the wrong man.

          For the first time.  Norma really looks at him
          through her dark glasses.

                            GILLIS
                 I had some trouble with my car.
                 Flat tire.  I pulled into your
                 garage till I could get a spare.
                 I thought this was an empty house.

                            NORMA
                 It is not.  Get out.

                            GILLIS
                 I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost
                 your friend, and I don't think red
                 is the right color.

                            NORMA
                 Get out.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't
                 I seen you -- ?


                            NORMA
                 Or shall I call my servant?

                            GILLIS
                 I know your face.  You're Norma
                 Desmond.  You used to be in
                 pictures.  You used to be big.

                            NORMA
                 I am big.  It's the pictures
                 that got small.

                            GILLIS
                 I knew there was something
                 wrong with them.

                            NORMA
                 They're dead.  They're finished.
                 There was a time when this busi-
                 ness had the eyes of the whole
                 wide world.  But that wasn't good
                 enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the
                 ears of the world, too.  So they
                 opened their big mouths, and out
                 came talk, talk, talk...

                            GILLIS
                 That's where the popcorn business
                 comes in.  You buy yourself a bag
                 and plug up your ears.

                            NORMA
                 Look at them in the front offices --
                 the master minds! They took the
                 idols and smashed them.  The
                 Fairbankses and the Chaplins and
                 the Gilberts and the Valentinos.
                 And who have they got now?  Some
                 nobodies -- a lot of pale little
                 frogs croaking pish-poshl

                            GILLIS
                 Don't get sore at me.  I'm not
                 an executive.  I'm just a writer.

                            NORMA
                 You are! Writing words, words!
                 You've made a rope of words and
                 strangled this businessl But there
                 is a microphone right there to catch
                 the last gurgles, and Technicolor
                 to photograph the red, swollen tongue!



                            GILLIS
                 Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.

                            NORMA
                 Get out!

          Gillis starts down the stairs.

                            GILLIS
                 Next time I'll bring my autograph
                 album along, or maybe a hunk of
                 cement and ask for your footprints.

          He is halfway down the staircase when he is
          stopped by

                            NORMA
                 Just a minute, you!

                            GILLIS
                 Yeah?

                            NORMA
                 You're a writer, you said.

                            GILLIS
                 Why?

          Norma starts down the stairs.

                            NORMA
                 Are you or aren't you?

                            GILLIS
                 I think that's what it says on my
                 driver's license.

                            NORMA
                 And you have written pictures,
                 haven't you?

                            GILLIS
                 Sure have.  The last one I
                 wrote was about cattle rustlers.
                 Before they were through with it,
                 the whole thing played on a
                 torpedo boat.

          Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase.

                            NORMA
                 I want to ask you something.
                 Come in here.

          She leads him into


  A-33    THE HUGE LIVING ROOM

          It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and
          red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props
          from the Mark of Zorro set.  Along the main wall,
          a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years.
          On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of
          Norma Desmond in her various roles.  On one wall
          is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene,
          Carthay Circle school.  (We will learn later that
          it hides a motion picture screen.)

          One corner is filled with a large pipe organ, and
          as Norma and Gillis enter, there is a grizzly
          moaning sound.  Gillis looks around.

                            NORMA
                 The wind gets in that blasted
                 pipe organ.  I ought to have
                 it taken out.

                            GILLIS
                 Or teach it a better tune.

          Norma has led him to the card tables which stand
          side by side near a window.  They are piled high
          with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand.

                            NORMA
                 How long is a movie script these
                 days?  I mean, how many pages?

                            GILLIS
                 Depends on what it is -- a Donald
                 Duck or Joan or Arc.

                            NORMA
                 This is to be a very important
                 picture.  I have written it
                 myself.  Took me years.

                            GILLIS
                      (Looking at the piles
                       of script)
                 Looks like enough for six impor-
                 tant pictures.

                            NORMA
                 It's the story or Salome.  I
                 think I'll have DeMille direct it.

                            GILLIS
                 Uh-huh.


                            NORMA
                 We've made a lot of pictures
                 together.

                            GILLIS
                 And you'll play Salome?

                            NORMA
                 Who else ?

                            GILLIS
                 Only asking.  I did't know
                 you were planning a comeback.

                            NORMA
                 I hate that word.  It is a return.
                 A return to the millions of people
                 who have never forgiven me for
                 deserting the screen.

                            GILLIS
                 Fair enough.

                            NORMA
                 Salome -- what a woman! What a
                 part! The Princess in love with
                 a Holy man.  She dances the Dance
                 of the Seven Veils.  He rejects
                 her, so she demands his head on a
                 golden tray, kissing his cold, dead
                 lips.

                            GILLIS
                 They'll love it in Pomona.

                            NORMA
                      (Taking it straight)
                 They will love it every place.
                      (She reaches for a
                       batch of pages from
                       the heap)
                 Read it.  Read the scene just
                 before she has him killed!

                            GILLIS
                 Right now?  Never let another
                 writer read your stuff.  He
                 may steal it.

                            NORMA
                 I am not afraid.  Read it!

                            NORMA (Cont'd)
                      (Calling)
                 Max!  Max!
                      (To Gillis)
                 Sit down.  Is there enough light?

                            GILLIS
                 I've got twenty-twenty vision.

          Max has entered.

                            NORMA
                 Bring something to drink.

                            MAX
                 Yes.  Madame.

          He leaves.  Norma turns to Gillis again.

                            NORMA
                 I said sit down.

          There is compulsion in her voice.

          Gillis looks at her                   GILLIS' VOICE
          and starts slowly          Well.  I had no pressing
          reading.                   engagement, and she'd men-
                                     tioned something to drink..
          Max comes in, wheeling     Sometimes it's interesting
          a wicker tea wagon on      to see just how bad bad
          which are two bottles o    writing can be.  This prom-

          sits on her feet.  deep    Max wheeled in some champagne
          in a chair, a gold ring    and some caviar.  Later, I
          on her forefinger with     found out that Max was the
          a clip which holds a       only other person in that
          cigarette.  She gets up    grim Sunset castle, and I
          and forces on Gillis       found out a few other things
          another batch of script,   about him... As for her, she
          goes back to her chair.    sat coiled up like a watch

                                     glasses, defying me not to
                                     like what I read, or maybe
                                     begging me in her own proud
                                     way to like it.  It meant
                                     so much to her...

  A-35    GILLIS                 It got to be eleven.  I was
                                 feeling a little sick at my
          reading.  The lamp     stomach, what with that sweet
          beside him is now      champagne and that tripe I'd
          really paying its      been reading -- that silly

          script pages are       started concocting a little

          around his feet.  A
          half-empty champagne

          arm of his chair.

          THE CAMERA SLOWLY DRAWS BACK to include Norma
          Desmond sitting in the dusk, just as she was before.
          Gillis puts down a batch of script.  There is a
          little pause.

                     (Impatiently)
                 Well?

                           GILLIS
                 This is fascinating.

                           NORMA
                 Of course it is.

                           GILLIS
                 Maybe it's a little long and
                 maybe there are some repetitions...
                 but you're not a professional
                 writer.

                            NORMA
                 I wrote that with my heart.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure you did.  That's what makes
                 it great.  What it needs is a
                 little more dialogue.

                            NORMA
                 What for?  I can say anything I
                 want with my eyes.

                            GILLIS
                 It certainly could use a pair of
                 shears and a blue pencil.

                            NORMA
                 I will not have it butchered.

                            GILLIS
                 Of course not.  But it ought to
                 be organized.  Just an editing
                 job.  You can find somebody.

                            NORMA
                 Who?  I'd have to have somebody
                 I can trust.  When were you born --
                 I mean, what sign of the zodiac?

                            GILLIS
                 I don't know.

                            NORMA
                 What month?

                            GILLIS

                 You can trust them.

                            GILLIS
                 Thank you.

                            NORMA
                 I want you to do this work.

                            GILLIS
                 Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished
                 one script.  I'm due on another
                 assignment.

                            NORMA
                 I don't care.


                            GILLIS
                 You know, I'm pretty expensive.
                 I get five hundred a week.

                            NORMA
                 I wouldn't worry about money.
                 I'll make it worth your while.

                            GILLIS
                 Maybe I'd better take the rest
                 of the script home and read it -

                            NORMA
                 Oh no.  I couldn't let it out
                 of my house.  You'll have to
                 finish it here.

                            GILLIS
                 It's getting kind of late --

  A-36    SMALL STAIRCASE, LEAD-          GILLIS'VOICE
          ING TO ROOM OVER GARAGE  I felt kind of pleased with
                                   the way I'd handled the sit-

          Max pushes open a door at the top of the stairs.

                            MAX
                      (Opening the door)
                 I made your bed this afternoon.

                      (On second thought)
                 How did you know I was going to
                 stay, this afternoon?

          Max doesn't answer.  He walks across to the bed,
          screws a bulb in the open socket above it.  The
          light goes on, revealing:

  A-37    A GABLED BEDROOM

          There are dirty windows on two sides, and dingy wall-
          paper on the cracked plaster walls.  For furniture
          there is a neatly made bed, a table and a few chairs
          which might have been discarded from the main house.

                            MAX
                 This room has not been used for
                 a long time.

                            GILLIS
                 It will never make house Beautiful.
                 I guess it's O.K. for one night.

          Max gives him an enigmatic look.

                      (Pointing)
                 There is the bathroom.  I put in

                            MAX
                 She was the greatest.  You wouldn't
                 know.  You are too young.  In one
                 week she got seventeen thousand fan
                 letters.  Men would bribe her mani-
                 curist to get clippings from her
                 fingernails.  There was a Maharajah
                 who came all the way from Hyderabad
                 to get one of her stockings.  Later,

          He sits in a shaft of gray light coming from an open
          French window.

          Through the far archway, Gillis storms into the big
          room.

                Hey, you -- Max -- whatever -your-
                name-is -- what are my things doing
                here?

          No answer.

                            GILLIS
                I'm talking to you.  My clothes
                and things are up in the room.

                            MAX
                Naturally.  I brought them myself.

                            GILLIS

                Why are you so upset?  Is there
                anything missing?

          Gillis looks around.

          On the couch by the fireplace reclines Norma Desmond,
          dressed in a negligee.  She rises.

                             NORMA
                  I don't know why you should be

                  in the deal about my staying

                  You'll like it here.

                             GILLIS
                  Thanks for the invitation, but
                  I have my own apartment.

                  It's all taken care of.  It's

                  I'm used to paying my own bills.

                  You proud boy, why didn't you tell
                  me you were having difficulties.

                             GILLIS
                  Okay.  We'll deduct it from my

                                       child of hers.

          Gillis takes two or three pages from Norma's hand-
          written script, crosses them out and puts them to
          one side.

          Norma rises, crosses towards Gillis, looks over his
          shoulder.

          place, crosses to the bridge table, puts the
          ashtray down, leans over and speaks into Norma's ear.

                            GILLIS
                 I want to talk to you for a

          Gillis stands frustrated, hideously embarrassed
          by the stares of the waxworks. He turns away
          and hurries to the door.

          It is half open. Gillis comes into the shot
          and, taking cover, looks out.


   B-19   COURTYARD (FROM GILLIS' ANGLE)

          The men from the finance company are cranking up
          the car.  Max stands watching silently.  When they
          finish the cranking job, the men climb into the
          front seat of the truck.

          Gillis stands in front of a full-length triple mirror,

          is busily working out alterations.

          Gillis wears a double-breasted gray flannel coat with
          chalk stripes.  His trousers belong to another suit

          up his shirts, goes over to a closet, opens it.  As
          he does so one of the doors without a lock swings

                            NORMA
                 Perfect.  Wonderful shoulders.
                 And I love that line.


          She indicates the V from his shoulders to his hips.

                            GILLIS
                 All padding.  Don't let it fool
                 you.

                            NORMA
                 Come here!

          She puts the gardenia on his lapel.

                            GILLIS
                 You know, to me dressing up
                 was always just putting on
                 my dark blue suit.

                            NORMA
                 I don't like those studs they've
                 sent.  I want you to have pearls.
                 Nice big pearls.

                            GILLIS
                 Now, I'm not going to wear ear-
                 rings, I can tell you that.

                            NORMA
                 Cute.  Let's have some drinks.

          She leads him over to the buffet.

                            GILLIS
                 Shouldn't we wait for the others?

                            NORMA
                      (Pointing at the floor)
                 Careful, it's slippery.  I
                 had it waxed.

          They reach the buffet.  Max is ready with two
          glasses of champagne.  Norma hands Gillis a glass.

                            NORMA
                 Here's to us.

          They drink.

                            NORMA
                 You know, this floor used to
                 be wood but I had it changed.
                 Valentino said there is nothing
                 like tiles for a tango.

          She opens her arms.



                            GILLIS
                 Not on the same floor with
                 Valentino!

                            NORMA
                 Just follow me.

          They start to tango.  After a moment --

                            NORMA
                 Don't bend back like that.

                            GILLIS
                 It's those feathers.  They tickle.

          Norma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair
          and tosses them away.


  C-7     THE ORCHESTRA

          As they play the tango, the musicians eye the danc-
          ing couple, take in the situation, exchange glances
          and turn away with professional discretion.


  C-8     NORMA AND GILLIS, TANGOING

          Gillis glances at his wrist watch.

                            GILLIS
                 It's a quarter past ten.  What
                 time are they supposed to get
                 here?

                            NORMA
                 Who?

                            GILLIS
                 The other guests?

                            NORMA
                 There are no other guests.  We
                 don't want to share this night
                 with other people.  This is for
                 you and me.

                            GILLIS
                 I understand some rich guy bought
                 up all the tickets for a perfor-
                 mance at the Metropolitan and sat
                 there listening to La Traviata,
                 all by himself.  He was afraid of
                 catching cold.


                            NORMA
                 Hold me tighter.

                            GILLIS
                 Come midnight, how about blind-
                 folding the orchestra and smash-
                 ing champagne glasses on Max's
                 head?

                            NORMA
                 You think this is all very funny.

                            GILLIS
                 A little.

                            NORMA
                 Is it funny that I'm in love
                 with you?

                            GILLIS
                 What's that?

                            NORMA
                 I'm in love with you.  Don't you
                 know that? I've been in love
                 with you all along.

          They dance on.  Gillis is acutely embarrassed.
          THE CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, PANS past the faces
          of the musicians, who play on with a rather overe-
          mphasized lack of interest.  Finally it winds up
          on Max, behind the buffet.  He stands watching Gillis,
          a faint trace of pity in his eyes.

          DISSOLVE TO:


  C-9     NORMA'S FINGER, WITH THE
          CIGARETTE GADGET, as she          GILLIS' VOICE
          inserts a cigarette.        I'm sure a lot of you will
                                      laugh about this.  Ridicu-
                                      lous situation, wasn't it?
                                      -- a woman almost twice my
                                      age ...  It got to be about
                                      a quarter of eleven.  I
                                      felt caught, like a cig-
                                      arette in the prongs of
                                      that contraption on her
                                      finger.
          PULL BACK TO:

          NORMA AND GILLIS sitting on a couch in front of the
          cavernous fireplace.  Norma holds out her cigarette
          to Gillis, who lights it.


                            NORMA.
                 What a wonderful next year it's
                 going to be.  What fun we're going
                 to have.  I'II fill the pool for
                 you.  Or I'll open my house in
                 Malibu, and you can have the whole
                 ocean.  Or I'll buy you a boat
                 and we'll sail to Hawaii.

                            GILLIS
                 Stop it.  You aren't going to buy
                 me anything more.

                            NORMA
                 Don't be silly.
                      (She reaches under a
                       pillow of the couch
                       and brings out a
                       leather box)
                 Here.  I was going to give it to
                 you at midniglht.

          Gillis opens the box.  It contains a matched gold
          cigarette case and lighter.

                            NORMA
                 Read what's inside.

          Gillis snaps open the case.  Engraved inside the
          cover is: TO JOE FROM NORMA, and two bars of
          music.

                            GILLIS
                 What are the notes?

                            NORMA
                 "Mad about the boy."

                            GILLIS
                 Norma, I can't take it.  You've
                 bought me enough.

                            NORMA
                 Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer
                 than all this new Hollywood trash.
                 I've got a million dollars.

                            GILLIS
                 Keep it.

                            NORMA
                 I own three blocks downtown.
                 I have oil in Bakersfield --
                 pumping, pumping, pumping.
                 What's it for but to buy us
                 anything we want.

                            GILLIS
                 Cut out that us business.

          He rises.

                            NORMA
                 What's the matter with you?

                            GILLIS
                 What right do you have to take
                 me for granted?

                            NORMA
                 What right? Do you want me to
                 tell you?

                            GILLIS
                 Has it ever occurred that I may
                 have a life of my own? That there
                 may be some girl I'm crazy about?

                            NORMA
                 Who? Some car hop, or a dress
                 extra?

                            GILLIS
                 Why not? What I'm trying to say
                 is that I'm all wrong for you.
                 You want a Valentino -- somebody
                 with polo ponies -- a big shot --

                            NORMA
                      (Getting up slowly)
                 What you're trying to say is
                 that you don't want me to love
                 you.  Is that it?

          Gillis doesn't answer.  Norma slaps his face and
          rushes from the room and upstairs.

          Gillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek.


  C-1O    THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR

          Norma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor
          and into her bedroom, banging the door.  MOVE THE
          CAMERA toward the closed door, centering on the
          gouged-out lock.


  C-11    GILLIS, IN THE BIG ROOM

          He still stands motionless.  He glances around fur-
          tively, to see if his humiliation has been observed.


  C-12    THE ORCHESTRA

          The musicians are playing away.  They have turned
          their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious-
          ly for comfort.


  C-13    GILLIS

          His eyes move over toward


  C-14    MAX

          He is subtler than the musicians.  He appears very
          busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used
          glasses on a tray.  He walks across the room with
          them.


  C-15    GILLIS

          He starts slowly out.  As he does so his long gold
          key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa
          and holds him for a second of additional embarrass-
          ment.  He yanks it loose and walks with as much
          nonchalance as he can muster to


  C-16    THE HALL

          Crossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a
          look upstairs.  Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from
          its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the
          entrance door.  He opens the door on the darkness
          of the courtyard.


  C-17    EXT. DESMOND HOUSE 
          (NIGHT - RAIN)

          Gillis shuts the door.           GILLIS'VOICE
          He takes a few steps       I didn't know where I was
          forward, then stands       going.  I just had to get
          for a while breathing      out of there.  I had to be
          deep.  The rain is         with people my own age.  I
          balm to that cheek         had to hear somebody laugh
          where the slap still a     again.  I thought of Artie
          burns.  He walks for-      Green.  There was bound to
          ward with a great          be a New Year's shindig
          sense of relief.           going on in his apartment
                                     down on Las Palmas -- the
                                     hock shop set -- not a job
  C-18    DRIVEWAY LEADING TO        in the room.  but lots of
          	fun on the cuff.

          Gillis walks to the
          street, which is dark
          and empty.  He starts
          down Sunset in an
          Easterly direction.
          A car passes.  He
          tries to thumb a
          ride, without success.
          However, the second

          car, a florist's
          delivery wagon, stops.
          Gillis jumps in and the
          car drives off.

          DISSOLVE TO:

  C-19    ARTIE GREEN'S APARTMENT

          It is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed
          with young people flowing over into the miniature
          bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette.  The only
          drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass
          bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time.
          Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only
          a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests
          party dress.

          Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano
          and sings Tokio Rose.  By the door, a group of young
          men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso
          White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar,
          in the manner of a Bach choral.  Artie Green, a dark
          haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties,
          is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl.

          The door behind some of the singers is pushed open,
          jostling them out of their places.  In comes Gillis,
          his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat
          turned up.  Artie stops conducting, but the commer-
          cial goes right on.

                            ARTIE
                 Well, what do you know ! Joe
                 Gillis !

                            GILLIS
                 Hi, Artie.

                            ARTIE
                 Where have you been keeping that
                 gorgeous face of yours?

                            GILLIS
                 In a deep freeze.

                            ARTIE
                 I almost reported you to the Bureau
                 of Missing Persons.
                      (To the company)
                 Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the
                 well-known screen writer, opium
                 smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.

          Gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and
          Artie push their way into the room.

                            ARTIE
                 Give me your coat.

                            GILLIS
                 Let it ride for a while.

                            ARTIE
                 You're going to stay, aren't you?

                            GILLIS
                 That was the general idea.

                            ARTIE
                 Come on.

          Artie starts peeling the coat off Gillis.  Its
          texture takes his breath away.

                            ARTIE
                 What is this - mink?

          He has taken the coat.  He looks at Gillis standing
          there in tails.

                            ARTIE
                 Judas E. Priest, who did you
                 borrow that from? Adolphe
                 Menjou?

                            GILLIS
                 Close, but no cigar.

          Gillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the
          Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book-
          shelf.

                            ARTIE
                 Say, you're not really smuggling
                 opium these days,  are you?

                            GILLIS
                 Where's the bar?

          The two make their way toward the punch bowl.  It's
          a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis.  There
          are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails.
          When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a
          half-filled glass and fills it.

                            GILLIS
                 Good party.

                            ARTIE
                 The greatest.  They call me the Elsa
                 Maxwell of the assistant directors.
                      (To some guests who are
                       dipping their empty cups
                       into the punch bowl)
                 Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget
                 only calls for three drinks per extra.
                 Fake the rest.

                            GILLIS
                 Listen, Artie, can I stick around
                 here for a while?


                            ARTIE
                 Sure, this'll go on all night.

                            GILLIS
                 I mean, could you put me up for
                 a couple of weeks?

                            ARTIE
                 It just so happens we have a
                 vacancy on the couch.

                            GILLIS
                 I'll take it.

                            ARTIE
                 I'll have the bell-hop take care
                 of your luggage.

          He runs his finger across the decollete back of a
          girl standing in a group next them.

                            ARTIE
                 Just register here.

          The girl turns around.  She is Betty Schaefer.

                            BETTY
                 Hello, Mr.  Gillis.

                            ARTIE
                 You know each other?

          Gillis looks at her a little puzzled.

                            BETTY
                 Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter,
                 Sheldrake's office.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure.  Bases Loaded.

                            ARTIE
                 Wait a minute.  This is the woman
                 I love.  What's going on? Who
                 was loaded?

                            GILLIS
                 Don't worry.  She's just a fan
                 for my literary output.

                            BETTY
                      (to Artie)
                 Hurt feelings department.

                            GILLIS
                 About that luggage.  Where's
                 the phone?

                            ARTIE
                 Over by the Rainbow Room.

          Gillis squeezes his way through groups of people
          to the telephone, which is next to an open door
          leading to the bathroom.  The phone is busy.  A
          girl sits listening to it, giggling wildly.  Another
          girl beside her is laughing too.  They are apparently
          sharing a conversation with some man on the other end
          of the wire.  The telephone passes from hand to hand.
          Gillis watches impatiently, then

                            GILLIS
                 When youlre through with that
                 thing, can I have it?

          The girl just nods, going on with her chattering.
          Gillis stands waiting, and Betty Schaefer comes up
          with his glass.

                            BETTY
                 You forgot this.

                            GILLIS
                 Thanks.

                            BETTY
                 I've been hoping to run into you.

                            GILLIS
                 What for? To recover that knife
                 you stuck in my back?

                            BETTY
                 I felt a little guilty, so I got
                 out some of your old stories.

                            GILLIS
                 Why, you sweet kid.

                            BETTY
                 There's one called....Window...
                 something with a window.

                            GILLIS
                 Dark Windows.  How did you
                 like it?

                            BETTY
                 I didn't.

                            GILLIS
                 Thank you.

                            BETTY
                 Except for about six pages.
                 You've got a flashback there ...

          There is too much racket for her.

                            BETTY
                 Is there someplace we can talk?

                            GILLIS
                 How about the Rainbow Room?

          They squeeze their way towards the bathroom, past
          Artie.

                            ARTIE
                 I said you could have my couch.
                 I didn't say you could have my
                 girl.

                            BETTY
                 This is shop talk.

          She and Gillis go through the open door into


  C-20    ARTIE'S BATHROOM

          It's a little less noisy, although there are some
          guests there, chatting and having fun.  Betty and
          Gillis sit down on the edge of the tub.

                            GILLIS
                 Now if I got you correctly, there
                 was a short stretch of my fiction
                 you found worthy of notice.

                            BETTY
                 The flashback in the courtroom,
                 when she tells about being a
                 school teacher.

                            GILLIS
                 I had a teacher like that once.

                            BETTY
                 Maybe that's why it's good.
                 It's true, it's moving.  Now
                 why don't you use that character...

                            GILLIS
                 Who wants true? Who wants moving?

                            BETTY
                 Drop that attitude.  Here's some-
                 thing really worth while.

                            GILLIS
                 Want me to start right now?
                 Maybe there's some paper around.

                            BETTY
                 I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.

                            GILLIS
                 I've got some ideas myself.  One
                 of them being this is New Year's
                 Eve.  How about living it up a
                 little?

                            BETTY
                 As for instance?

                            GILLIS
                 Well....

                            BETTY
                 We could make some paper boats
                 and have a regatta.  Or should
                 we just turn on the shower?

                            GILLIS
                 How about capturing the kitchen
                 and barricading the door?

                            BETTY
                 Are you hungry?

                            GILLIS
                 Hungry? After twelve years in
                 the Burmese jungle.  I am starving,
                 Lady Agatha -- starving for a
                 white shoulder --

                            BETTY
                 Phillip, you're mad!

          One of the girls who was on the phone comes to
          the door.

                               GIRL
                 You can have the phone now.

                               GILLIS
                      (Paying no attention)
                 Thirsting for the coolness of
                 your lips -

                               BETTY
                 No, Phillip, no.  We must be
                 strong.  You're still wearing
                 the uniform of the Coldstream
                 Guards!  Furthermore, you can
                 have the phone now.

                               GILLIS
                 O.K.
                      (He gets up, starts
                       out, turns)
                 I find I'm terribly afraid of
                 losing you.

                               BETTY
                 You won't.
                      (She takes the glass
                       out of his hand)
                 I'll get us a refill of
                 this awful stuff.

                               GILLIS
                 You'll be waiting for me?

                               BETTY
                 With a wildly beating heart.

                               GILLIS
                 Life can be beautiful!

          He leaves.


  C-21    THE MAIN ROOM

          Gillis squeezes himself through some guests to
          the phone.  He has to stand in a cramped position,
          holding the instrument close to him as he dials
          a number.

                               GILLIS
                 Max?  This is Mr. Gillis.
                 I want you to do me a favor.

  C-22    NORMA DESMOND HOUSE

          Max is at the phone, in the lower hall.

                            MAX
                 I am sorry, Mr.  Gillis.
                 I cannot talk now.


  C-23    GILLIS ON THE PHONE

                            GILLIS
                 Yes you can.  I want you to get
                 my old suitcase and I want you
                 to throw in my old clothes --
                 the ones I came with, and my
                 typewriter.  I'll have somebody
                 pick them up.


  C-24    MAX AT THE PHONE

                            MAX
                 I have no time to talk.  The
                 doctor is here.


  C-25    GILLIS ON THE PHONE

                            GILLIS
                 What doctor? What's going on?


  C-26    MAX AT THE PHONE

                            MAX
                 She got the razor from your
                 room.  She cut her wrists.

          Max hangs up, moves toward the staircase.


  C-27    GILLIS AT THE PHONE

                            GILLIS
                 Max ! Max !

          He hangs up the dead receiver, stands numb   with
          shock.  Betty elbows her way up to him, carrying
          the two punch glasses filled again.

                            BETTY
                 I just got the recipe: take
                 two packages of cough drops,
                 dissolve in one gallon of
                 lukewarm grape juice --

          Gillis looks up at her.  Without a word he pushes
          her aside so that she spills the drink.  He makes
          his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls
          it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and
          rushes towards the door and out.  Betty stands look-
          ing after him, completely bewildered.

          DISSOLVE TO:


  C-28    EXT. DESMOND HOUSE - (NIGHT, RAIN)

          The doctor's car is parked in the driveway.  A taxi
          pulls up.  Gillis, in his Vicuna coat now, jumps
          out, throws a couple of dollars to the rdriver and
          runs toward the house.


  C-28a    DOORWAY, NORMA DESMOND HOUSE>

          Max is opening the door to let out the doctor, a
          professional looking man carrying a black bag.
          Gillis runs into the SHOT.

                            GILLIS
                 How is she?

                            MAX
                 She is upstairs.

          Gillis starts to push past Max.  Max grabs his arm.

                            MAX
                 Be careful.  Do not race up the
                 stairs.  The musicians must not
                 know what has happened.

          Gillis goes into the house.


  C-29    ENRANCE HALL AND STAIRCASE

          Gillis crosses the hall and starts up the stairs.


  C-3O    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ROOM

          Only one alabaster lamp lights the big, cold room.
          On the bed lies Norma in her evening dress.  She is
          white as a sheet.  Her wrists are bandaged.  Her eyes
          are wide open, staring at the ceiling.  One of her
          shoes has halt slipped off her foot.  The other is
          on.  Gillis opens the door and stands there tor a
          second.  Then he slowly moves to the toot of the bed.
          He takes the shoes from her feet and puts them on
          the floor.

                            NORMA
                 Go away.

                            GILLIS
                 What kind of a silly thing was
                 that to do?

                            NORMA
                 To fall in love with you -- that
                 was the idiotic thing.

                            GILLIS
                 It sure would have made attractive
                 headlines: Great Star Kills Her-
                 self for Unknown Writer.

                            NORMA
                 Great stars have great pride.

          She puts one bandaged forearm over her eyes, sobbing.
          Gillis walks slowly over to the mantelpiece, stands
          there for awhile.

                            NORMA
                 Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, I was making that up because
                 I thought the whole thing was a
                 mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you.
                 You've been good to me.  You're the
                 only person in this stinking town
                 that has been good to me.

                            NORMA
                 Why don't you just say thank you
                 and go, go, go --

                            GILLIS

                 I'll do it again, I'll do it again,
                 I'll do it again!

          Gillis stands looking at her helplessly.


  C-31    LIVING ROOM, THE DESMOND HOUSE

          The candles burned down, the orchestra playing to
          the emptiness.  The orchestra leader looks at his
          watch, rises, silences the orchestra, then starts
          them in on Auld Lang Syne.

                                                                       


  C-32    INT. NORMA'S ROOM

          Gillis still stands.  Norma lies on the bed, arms
          over her eyes, sobbing.

                            GILLIS
                 Happy New Year.

          Norma continues to sob.  Gillis goes to the bed,
          puts his arms on her shoulders and turns her around.

                            GILLIS
                 Happy New Year.

          Norma looks at him, tears in her eyes.  Slowly she
          enfolds him in her bandaged arms.

                            NORMA
                 Happy New Year.  darling.

          She kisses him.

                 sorry to bother you again, but I've
                 confirmed the number.  I must speak

          He hangs up.  From off comes:

                            NORMA'S VOICE
                 Who was it, Max?  What is it?


  D-1e    PATIO, NORMA'S HOUSE

          It is a sunny day.  The garden is in somewhat better
          shape.  The old house looks less unkept.  The pool
          is filled.  Norma sits on a wicker chaise longue, her
          face shielded by an enormous straw hat, her eyes by
          dark glasses.  Gillis, in bathing trunks, is on a
          rubber mattress in the pool.  Max comes to the
          entrance door.

                            MAX
                 Nothing, Madame.  Somebody Inqu-
                 iring about a stray dog.  We must
                 have a number very similar to the
                 pound.

          He starts to turn back.

                            NORMA
                 Wait a minute.  I want you to get
                 out the car.  You're going to
                 take the script over to Paramount
                 and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in
                 person.

                            MAX
                 Yes, Madame.

          He goes into the house.

                            GILLIS
                      (climbing out
                       of the water)
                 You're really going to send it
                 to De Mille?

                            NORMA
                 This is the right day.

          She indicates a typewritten letter she is holding.

                            NORMA (Cont'd)
                 The chart from my astrologer.
                 She read deMille's horoscope.
                 She read mine.

                            GILLIS
                 Did she read the script?

                            NORMA
                 DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio.
                 Mars has been transmitting
                 Jupiter for weeks.  Today is
                 the day of greatest conjuction.
                 Now turn around.  Let me dry
                 you.

          She puts the towel around his sholders and starts
          drying him.

                            GILLIS
                 I hope you realize, Norma,
                 that scripts don't sell on
                 astrologers' charts.

                            NORMA
                 I'm not just selling the script.
                 I'm selling me.  DeMille always
                 said I was his greatest star.

                            GILLIS
                  When did he say it, Norma?

                            NORMA
                 So he said it quite a few years
                 ago.  So what?  I never looked
                 better in my life.  Do you know
                 why?  Because I've never been as
                 happy in my life.

          She kisses him.

                            NORMA
                 That idiot.  He forgot to fill
                 my cigarette case.

                            GILLIS
                      (Proffering his case)
                 Have one of mine.

                            NORMA
                 They're awful.  They make me cough.

                            GILLIS
                      (Pushing open the glass
                       partition, to Max)
                 Pull up at the drugstore, will
                 you, Max.
                      (To Norma)
                 I'll get you some.

                            NORMA
                 You're a darling.

          She takes a dollar bill from her purse and gives it
          to him.


  D-3     EXT. SCHWAB'S DRUGSTORE
          The car drives up and Gillis hurries into the store.


  D-4     INT. SCHWAB'S DRUGSTORE
          Business is still rather lively.  There are about a
          dozen shoppers, and the soda counter is half filled.
          Gillis enters and steps to the tobacco counter.

                            GILLIS
                      (To the salesgirl)
                 Give me a pack of those Turkish
                 cigarettes -- Melachrinos.

          The girl opens the glass showcase to locate the fancy
          brand.  From OFF comes

                            ARTIE'S VOICE
                 Stick 'em up, Gillis, or I'll
                 let you have it!

          Gillis turns.


  D-5     AT THE SODA FOUNTAIN

          Artie Green and Betty Schaefer sit having a sandwich
          and a milk shake.  With his forefinger and a sound
          effect, Artie riddles Gillis' body.  Gillis walks
          INTO THE SHOT.

                            GILLIS
                 Hello, Artie.  Good evening,
                 Miss Schaefer.

                            BETTY
                      (Excitedly)
                 You don't know how glad I am
                 to see youl

                            ARTIE
                 Walking out on the mob.  What's
                 the big idea?

                            GILLIS
                 I'm sorry about New Year's. Would
                 you believe me if I said I had
                 to be with a sick friend?

                            ARTIE
                 Someone in the formal set, no
                 doubt, with a ten-carat kidney
                 stone.

                            BETTY
                 Stop it, Artie, will you?
                      (To Gillis)
                 Where have you been keeping your-
                 self? I've got the most wonderful
                 news for you.

                            GILLIS
                 I haven't been keeping myself at
                 all.  Not lately.

                            BETTY
                 I called your agent.  I called the
                 Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your
                 old apartment gave me some Crestview
                 number.  There was always somebody
                 with an accent growling at me.  You
                 were not there.  You were not to be
                 spoken to.  They never heard of you.

                            GILLIS
                 Is that so? What's the wonderful
                 news?

                            BETTY
                 Sheldrake likes that angle about
                 the teacher.

                            GILLIS
                 What teacher?

                            BETTY
                 Dark Windows.  I got him all
                 hopped up about it.

                            GILLIS
                 You did?

                            BETTY
                 He thinks it could be made into
                 something.

                            GILLIS
                 Into what? A lampshade?

                            BETTY
                 Into something for Barbara Stan-
                 wyck.  They have a commitment with
                 Barbara Stanwyck.

                            ARTIE
                 Unless you'd rather have Sarah
                 Bernhardt.

                            BETTY
                 This is on the level.  Sheldrake
                 really went for it.

                            GILLIS
                 O.K.  Where's the cash?

                            BETTY
                 Where's the story? I bluffed it
                 out with a few notions of my own.
                 It's really just a springboard.
                 It needs work.

                            GILLIS
                 I was afraid of that.

                               BETTY
                    I've got twenty pages of notes.
                    I've got a pretty good character
                    for the man.

                               ARTIE
                    Could you write in plenty of back-
                    ground action, so they'll need an
                    extra assistant director?

                               BETTY
                    Shut up, Artie.
                         (To Gillis)
                    Now if we could sit down for two
                    weeks and get a story.

                               GILLIS
                    Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've
                    given up writing on spec.

                               BETTY
                    I tell you this is half sold.

                               GILLIS
                    As a matter of fact.  I've given
                    up writing altogether.

          Max has appeared in the door.

                              MAX
                   Mr. Gillis, if you please.

                              GILLIS
                   Right with you.

          Max leaves.

                              ARTIE
                   The accent! I've got it: this guy
                   is in the pay of a foreign government.
                   Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.

                              GILLIS
                   I've got to run along.  Thanks any-
                   way for your interest in my career.

                              BETTY
                   It's not your career -- it's mine.
                   I kind of hoped to get in on this
                   deal.  I don't want to be a reader
                   all my life.  I want to write.

                              GILLIS
                   Sorry if I crossed you up.

                              BETTY
                   You sure have.

                              GILLIS
                   So long.

          He leaves.

                      (Patting her hand)
                 Babe, it's like that producer says:
                 In life, you've got to take the
                 bitter with the sour.


  D-6     THE ISOTTA, PARKED OUTSIDE

          Gillis comes from Schwab's, gets into the car.

          Max takes off.

                            NORMA
                 What on earth, darling? It took
                 you hours.

                            GILLIS
                 I ran into some people I knew.

                            NORMA

          He realizes he's forgotten them, takes the dollar
          and hands it back to her.

          side of the parasol,      for me: the Norma Desmond

          around her head with      was always the Mack Sennett
          a rabbit's-ear bow.       Bathing Beauty.
          She bats her eyes,
          winks roguishly.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that Norma's black
          pyjama trousers are rolled up over her knees and her
          black stockings rolled down below them.  The whole
          effect approximates a Mack Sennett bathing costume
          pretty effectively.  She points at a leather pour.

                 This is a rock.

          She climbs on it, pantomimes timidity, an attempted
          dive, then jumps off.

          Gillis lolls on a couch, watching the performance,
          very bored.

                 Nothing is the matter.  I'm having
                 a great time.  Show me some more.

                 All right.  Give me this.  I need

          Gillis opens his eyes.

          Norma has equipped herselr with a derby hat, a cane,
          and blacked in a small moustache.  She goes into a
          little Chaplin routine.  While she is doing it, the
          telephone rings.  After a moment Max comes to the
          living room door.

                 Madame is wanted on the telephone.

                 Now, now do you belive me? I told
                 you deMille would jump at it.

                            MAX
                 It is not Mr. deMille in person.
                 It is someone by the name or Gordon
                 Cole.  He says it's very important.

                            NORMA
                 Certainly it's important.  It's
                 important enough for Mr. deMille
                 to call me personally.  The idea
                 of having an assistant call me!

                            MAX
                 I myself was surprised at Mr. de
                 Mille's manners.

                            NORMA
                 Say that I'm busy, and hang up.

          He bows and exits.

                 Maybe deMille is shooting.

                            NORMA
                 I know that trick! He wants to
                 belittle me.  He's trying to get
                 my price down.  I've waited
                 twenty years for this call.  Now
                 Mr. deMille can wait till I'm
                 good and ready.

          The car drives down Bronson and stops smack in front

  D-10    STAGE 18

          A scene from SAMPSON AND DELILAH is being rehearsed
          in the background.  The usual turbulent activity
          surrounds it: extras.  makeup men, grips,
          assistants, etc., etc.  In the dim foreground a
          stage hand is answering a stand telephone.  He
          puts down the phone and moves (CAMERA WITH HIM)

                 Norma Desmond is coming to see
                 Mr. deMille.

          The second assistant walks (CAMERA WITH HIM)
          to the first assistant.

                 Norma Desmond coming in to
                 see Mr. deMille.

          The first assistant (CAMERA WITH HIM) hurries
          to the set.  Sitting with his back toward us
          is C.B. himself.  He is rehearsing a scene with
          Hedy Lamarr.

                 Norma Desmond is coming in to
                 see you, Mr. deMille.

                            lst ASSISTANT
                 She must be a million years old.

                 I hate to think where that puts
                 me.  I could be her father.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.

          By this time de Mille is on his feet.

                            DEMILLE
                 It must be about that appalling
                 script of hers.  What can I say
                 to her? What can I say?

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I can tell her you're all tied
                 up in the projection room.  I
                 can give her the brush ...

                            DEMILLE
                 Listen, thirty million fans
                 have given her the brush.
                 Isn't that enough?

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I didn't mean to --

                            DEMILLE
                 Of course you didn't.  You didn't
                 know Norma Desmond as a plucky
                 little girl of seventeen, with
                 more courage and wit and heart
                 than ever came together in one
                 youngster.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 I hear she was a terror to
                 work with.

                            DEMILLE
                 She got to be.  A dozen press
                 agents working overtime can
                 do terrible things to the human

          out his arms.

                   Last time I saw you was someplace
                   very gay.  I remember waving to you.
                   I was dancing on a table.

                             DE MILLE
                  Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had
                  just landed in Paris.  Come on in.

          He leads her into


  D-13    STAGE 18

          During the ensuing dialogue, Mr. deMille walks Norma
          towards the set.

                   Norma, I want to apologize for
                   not calling you.

                              NORMA
                   You'd better.  I'm very angry.

                              DE MILLE
                   I'm pretty busy, as you can see...

                              NORMA
                   That's no excuse.  You read the
                   script, didn't you?

                              DE MILLE
                   Yes, I did.

                              NORMA
                   Then you could have picked up the
                   phone yourself instead of leaving
                   it to one of your assistants.

                              DE MILLE
                   What assistant?

                             NORMA
                  Don't play innocent.  Somebody
                  named Gordon Cole.

                             DE MILLE
                  Gordon Cole?

                             NORMA
                  And if you hadn't been pretty
                  darned interested in that script,
                  he wouldn't have tried to get
                  me on the phone ten times.

                             DE MILLE
                  Gordon Cole... Look, Norma,
                  I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.
                       (Indicating his
                        own chair)
                  Make yourself comfortable.

          He walks onto the set, accompanied by his assistants.

                             DE MILLE
                       (Sotto voce, to his
                        first assistant)
                  Get me Gordon Cole on the phone.

          Meanwhile, Norma starts to sit, sees the name
          MISS LAMARR on the chair and with a look of
          distaste changes and sits on the one marked
          C.B. DE MILLE.    From somewhere comes

                             A VOICE
                  Hey, Miss Desmond! Miss Desmond!

          She looks around her.

                           VOICE
                Up here!

          Norma looks up at the scaffolding.

          On the scaffold stands one of the electricians,
          next to his light.

                           ELECTRICIAN
                It's met It's Hog-eyel

          Norma waves at him.

                           NORMA
                Hello.

          Hog-eye points his light at her.

                           HOG-EYE
                Let's get a look at you.

          The beam of the lamp moves toward Norma.  It hits
          her.  She sits bathed in light.  A couple of old
          costume extras recognize her.

                           EXTRAS
                Say, it's Norma! Norma Desmond!

          They rush over and start wringing her hand.  Into
          the shot comes a middle-aged hairdresser.

                           HAIRDRESSER
                Hello, Miss Desmond.  It's Bessie.

          Some elderly electricians and stagehands move in.


  D-14    ANOTHER PART OF THE STAGE

          The first assistant brings the portable phone to
          deMille.  DeMille lifts the receiver.

                           DE MILLE
                Hello.


  D-15    GORDON COLE'S OFFICE IN THE PROPERTY DEPARTMENT,
          GORDON COLE ON THE PHONE.

                           COLE
                Prop Department.  Gordon Cole speaking.

  D-16    DE MILLE ON THE PHONE

                            DE MILLE
                 Cole, this is C. B. deMille.  Have
                 you been calling Norma Desmond?...
                 What's it about?


  D-17    GORDON COLE, ON THE PHONE

                            COLE
                 It's that car of hers -- an old
                 Isotta-Fraschini.  Her chauffeur
                 drove it on the lot the other day.
                 It looks just right for the Crosby
                 picture.  We want to rent it for a
                 couple of weeks.


  D-18    DE MILLE ON THE PHONE

                            DE MILLE
                      (Troubled)
                 Oh.  Well, thank you.

          He hangs up, walks back towards Norma.  (CAMERA
          WITH HIM).

          Norma stills sits in the shaft of light, surrounded
          by about a dozen people who have come up to pay court.
          DeMille gestures up to Hog-eye and the light shifts
          away.  The people about Norma disperse slowly with
          various ad-libs.

                            DE MILLE
                 Well, Norma ...
                      (He sits down next to her)
                 I got hold of Gordon Cole.

          Norma hasn't heard a word.

                            NORMA
                 Did you see them? Did you see
                 how they came?

                            DE MILLE
                 You know, crazy things happen in
                 this business.  I hope you haven't
                 lost your sense of humor ...

          Suddenly he realizes that she is crying.  She takes
          the handkerchief from his pocket and puts it over her
          eyes.

                            DEMILLE
                 What's the matter, Norma?

                            NORMA
                 Nothing.  I just didn't realize
                 what it would be like to come back
                 to the old studio.  I had no idea
                 how I'd missed it.

                            DEMILLE
                 We've missed you too, dear.

                            NORMA
                 We'll be working again, won't we, Chief?
                 We'll make our greatest picture.

                            DEMILLE
                 That's what I want to talk to you about.

                            NORMA
                 It's a good script, isn't it?

                            DEMILLE
                 It's got a lot of good things.  Of
                 course, it would be an expensive picture...

                            NORMA
                 I don't care about the money.
                 I just want to work again.  You
                 don't know what it means to know
                 that you want me.

                            DEMILLE
                 Nothing would thrill me more --
                 if it were possible.

                            NORMA
                 But remember, darling -- I don't
                 work before ten in the morning,
                 and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.

          The first assistant comes up.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.

                            DEMILLE
                 You'll pardon me, Norma? Why
                 don't you just sit and watch?
                      (He steps onto the set)
                 O.K.  Here we go.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 Roll 'em.

                            DEMILLE
                 Action!
          The scene starts.

  D-19    THE ISOTTA, PARKED OUTSIDE STAGE 18

          Max stands talking to Gillis, who is seated in the
          car.

                            MAX
                      (Pointing to the row
                       of offices in the
                       building opposite)
                 You see those offices there, Mr.
                 Gillis? They used to be her
                 dressing room, The whole row.

                            GILLIS
                 That didn't leave much for Wallace
                 Reid.

                            MAX
                 He had a great big bungalow on
                 wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See
                 where it says 'Readers' Department'?
                 I remember my walls were covered
                 with black patent leather...

          The words "Readers' Department" have registered on
          Gillis' mind.  He gets out of the car.

                            GILLIS
                 I'll be with you in a minute.

          He crosses the street towards the green staircase
          leading to the second floor.

          Meanwhile, two prop men walking down the street
          come into the SHOT.

                            1ST PROP MAN
                 Hey, that's the comic car Cole
                 was talking about!
                       (To Max)
                 Do you mind if we look inside?

                            MAX
                 Go away.  Go away.


  D-2O    CUBICLE IN THE READERS' DEPARTMENT

          Behind the desk sits Betty, typing the synopsis of
          a novel, a half-eaten apple marking her place.  The
          door behind her opens and Gillis enters.

                            GILLIS
                 Just so you don't think I'm a
                 complete swine -- if there's
                 anything in Dark Windows you
                 can use, take it.  It's all
                 yours.

                            BETTY
                 Well, for heaven's sake!

          She moves the book and the apple aside and points at
          the free space on the desk.

                            BETTY
                 Have a chair.

          Gillis sits on the desk.

                            GILLIS
                 I mean it.  It's no good to me
                 anyway.  Help yourself.

                            BETTY
                 Why should you do that?

                            GILLIS
                 If you get a hundred thousand for
                 it, you buy me a box of chocolate
                 creams.  If you get an Oscar, I
                 get the left foot.

                            BETTY
                 You know, I'd take you up on that
                 in a minute.  I'm just not good
                 enough to do it all by myself.

                            GILLIS
                 What about all those ideas you had?

                            BETTY
                 See if they make sense.  To begin
                 with, I think you should throw out
                 all that psychological stuff --
                 exploring a killer's sick mind.

                            GILLIS
                 Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

                            BETTY
                 This story is about teachers --
                 their threadbare lives, their
                 struggles.  Here are people doing
                 the most important job in the
                 world, and they have to wprry
                 about getting enough money to
                 re-sole their shoes.  To me it
                 can be as exciting as any chase,
                 any gunplay.

                            GILLIS
                 Check.

                            BETTY
                 Now I see her teaching day classes
                 while he teaches night school.  The
                 first time they meet ...

          From below comes the SOUND of the Isotta's horn.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, if you don't mind, I haven't
                 got time to listen to the whole
                 plot ...

                            BETTY
                 I'll make it short.

                            GILLIS
                 Sorry.  It's your baby now.

                            BETTY
                 I'm not good enough to write it
                 alone.  We'll have to do it together.

                            GILLIS
                 I'm all tied up.  I can't.

                            BETTY
                 Couldn't we work in the evenings?
                 Six o'clock in the morning? This
                 next month I'm completely at your
                 disposal.  Artie is out of town.

                            GILLIS
                 What has Artie to do with it.

                            BETTY
                 We're engaged.

                            GILLIS
                 Good for you.  You've got yourself
                 the best guy in town.

                            BETTY
                 I think so.  They're on location
                 in Arizona, shooting a Western.
                 I'm free every evening, every week-
                 end.  If you want, we could work at
                 your place.

                            GILLIS
                 It's just impossible.

                            BETTY
                 Nobody can be that busy.

          There is another honk: from down below.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, Betty, It can't be done.
                 It's out.

                            BETTY
                 You're tough, all right.

                            GILLIS
                 You're on your own.  Stop being
                 chicken-hearted and write that story.

                            BETTY
                 Honest to goodness, I hate you.

                            GILLIS
                      (Turning 1n the open door)
                 And don't make it too dreary.  How
                 about this for a situation: she
                 teaches daytimes.  He teaches at
                 night.  Right?  They don't even know
                 each other, but they share the same
                 room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a
                 matter of fact, they sleep in the
                 same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.

                            BETTY
                 Are you kidding? Because I think
                 it's good.

                            GILLIS
                 So do I.

                            BETTY
                 Came  on back.  Let me show you
                 where it fits in.

          She reaches in a drawer for her notes on Dark
          Windows.

                            GILLIS
                       (At the door)
                 So long.

          Betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it

                 Oh, you --

                 And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR
                 THE TEACHER.

          He ducks out quiokly, slamming the door behind him.
          Betty looks after him, then angrlly hurls the
          apple into the wastebasket.


  D-21    STAIRCASE OUTSIDE READERS' DEPARTMENT

          Max is rush1ng up the stairs toward the descending
          Gillis.

                            GILLIS
                 What's the matter, Max?

                            MAX
                 I just found out why all those tele-
                 phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond
                 they want.  It is the car they want
                 to rent.

                            GILLIS
                 What?

          Max has seen something off.

                            MAX
                 Ssh...

          With his head he indicates


  D-22    ENTRANCE TO STAGE 18

          The first assistant has opened the door.  DeMille
          is showing Norma out.

                            DE MILLE
                 Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see
                 what we can do.

                            NORMA
                      (embracing him)
                 I'm not worried.  Everything will
                 be fine.  The old team together.
                 Nothing can stop us.

          She turns and walks out of the shot.  De Mille
          stands for a second watching her, then turns to
          his assistant.

                            DE MILLE
                 Get Gordon Cole.  Tell him to forget
                 about her car.  He can find another
                 old car.  I'll buy him five old cars,
                 if necessary.

                            1ST ASSISTANT
                 Yes, Mr. De Mille.

          They turn back into Stage 18.

  D-23    THE ISOTTA

          Gillis seated in the rear.  Max is helping Norma
          in and putting the robe over her.

                           GILLIS
                      (Apprehensively)
                How did it go?

                           NORMA
                It couldn't have gone better.
                It's practically set.  Of course,
                he has to finish this picture
                first, but mine will be his next.

          There is an exchange of looks between Max and Gillis.

                           GILLIS
                He must be quite a guy.

                           NORMA
                He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can
                smell box office.  Only I'm going
                to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't
                going to be C. B. deMille's Salome.
                It's going to be Norma Desmond's
                Salome, a Norma Desmond Production,
                starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.

                           MAX
                Yes, Miss Desmond.

          As he says the words, he and Gillis exchange a glance
          in the rear view mirror.

          IN HER BEDROOM

          It is nine o'clock in the evening.  She is in night
          gown and negligee and has put triangular patches on
          the saddle of her nose and at the outer corner of
          each eye.  She is rubbing lotion on her hands.

          She gets up and crosses to the door of Gillis' room
          and opens it a crack.

                             NORMA
                   Joe darling, are you there?

  E-4     GILLIS' ROOM

          It is dark except for a lamp over the chaise longue.
          Gillis lies on it, fully clothed, reading a book.

                             GILLIS
                   Yes, Norma.

          Through the slit in the door there is a suggestion
          of Norma.

                             NORMA
                  Don't turn around.  Keep your
                  eyes on the book.

                             GILLIS
                  Yes, Norma.

          Norma pushes the door open and comes in.

                             NORMA
                  I just came to say good night.
                  I don't want you to see me --
                  I'm not very attractive.

                             GILLIS
                  Good night.

                             NORMA
                  I've lost half a pound since
                  Tuesday.

                             GILLIS
                  Good.

                             NORMA
                  I was a little worried about the
                  line of my throat.  This woman
                  has done wonders with it.

                             GILLIS
                  Good.

                             NORMA
                  You'd better get to bed yourself.

                             GILLIS
                  I think I'll read a little.

                             NORMA
                  You went out last night, didn't
                  you, Joe?

                             GILLIS
                  Why do you say that?

                             NORMA
                  I just happen to know it.  I had
                  a nightmare and I screamed for
                  you.  You weren't here.  Where
                  were you?

                             GILLIS
                  I went for a walk.

                             NORMA
                  No you didn't.  You took the
                  car.

                             GILLIS
                  All right, I drove to the beach.
                  Norma, you don't want me to feel
                  I'm locked up in this house?

                             NORMA
                  Of course not, Joe.  It's just
                  that I don't want to be left alone.
                  Not now, while I'm under this
                  terrible strain.  My nerves are
                  being torn apart.  All I ask is
                  for you to be a little patient and a
                  little kind.

                             GILLIS
                  I haven't done anything, Norma.

                             NORMA
                  Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't
                  let you.

          She bends and kisses the top of his head.

                             NORMA
                  Good night, my darling.

          She goes into her room, shutting the door behind her.

          Gillis puts his book down and looks at her door.

          Gillis comes into the shot,
          gets into the Isotta, drives

          the driveway to Sunset, as
          quietly as possible.

          BOOM MOVES FORWARD to the only     So we'd started
          two lights.  They are the door     working on it, the
          and window of Betty Schaefer's     two of us.  Nights,
          cubicle.  Betty sits at the        when the studio was
          desk, typing.  Gillis, his         deserted, up in her
          coat off, his shirt-sleeves        little cubby-hole
          rolled up, j.s pacing the floor,   of an office.
          discussing the construction of
          a sentence.  The discussion at
          a stalemate, Betty suggests
          some coffee.  Gillis agrees.
          From the electric plate on the
          shelf beside her, Betty takes
          a glass coffee machine.  Gillis
          seats himself in her chair
          and starts typing.

          Betty opens the door and comes out on the balcony to
          fill the coffee machine from the water cooler stand-
          ing beside the door.

                             BETTY
                   I got the funniest letter from
                   Artie.  It's rained every day
                   since they got to Arizona.  They
                   re-wrote the whole picture for
                   rain and shot half of it.  Now
                   the sun is out.  Nobody knows
                   when they'll get back.

          She moves back into the room.

                             GILLIS
                   Good.

                   What's good about it?  I miss

                             GILLIS
                   I mean this is good dialogue
                   along in here.  It'll play.

                             BETTY
                   It will?

                             GILLIS
                   Sure.  Especially with lots
                   of music underneath, drowning
                   it out.

                             BETTY
                   Don't you sometimes hate yourself?

                             GILLIS
                   Constantly.  No, in all serious-
                   ness, it's really good.  It's
                   fun writing again.  I'm happy
                   here, honest I am.

          He resumes typing.  Betty puts the water on.  She
          picks up a pack of cigarettes on the desk, finds it's
          empty and throws it away, sees Gillis' open gold
          cigarette case and lighter on the table by the couch.
          Betty reaches for a cigarette.  The inscription en-
          graved inside the case catches her eye.  It reads:

                            MAD ABOUT THE BOY --

                             BETTY
                   I'm sorry.  I don't usually
                   read private cigarette cases.

                             GILLIS
                   Oh, that.  It's from a friend
                   of mine.  A middle-aged lady,
                   very foolish and very generous.

                             BETTY
                   I'll say.  This is solid gold.

                             GILLIS
                   I gave her some advice on an
                   idiotic script.

                             BETTY

  E-12    PARAMOUNT'S NEW YORK STREET (NIGHT)

          Betty and Gillis are walking down it, THE CAMERA
          AHEAD OF THEM.

                             BETTY
                   Look at this street.  All card-
                   board, all hollow, all phoney.
                   All done with mirrors.  I like
                   it better than any street in the
                   world.  Maybe because I used to
                   play here when I was a kid.

                             GILLIS
                   What were you -- a child actress?

                             BETTY
                   I was born just two blocks from
                   this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove
                   Avenue.  Father was head elec-
                   trician here till he died.  Mother
                   still works in Wardrobe.

                             GILLIS
                   Second generation, huh?

                             BETTY
                   Third.  Grandma did stunt work
                   for Pearl White.  I come from a
                   picture family.  Naturally they
                   took it for granted I was to become
                   a great star.  So I had ten years of
                   dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.
                   Then the studio made a test.  Well,
                   they didn't like my nose -- it slanted
                   this way a little.  I went to a doctor
                   and had it fixed.  They made more
                   tests, and they were crazy about my
                   nose -- only they didn't like my acting.

                             GILLIS
                      (Examining her nose
                       by the flame of his
                       lighter)
                   Nice job.

                             BETTY
                   Should be.  It cost three hundred
                   dollars.

                             GILLIS
                   Saddest thing I ever heard.

                             BETTY
                   Not at all.  It taught me a little
                   sense.  I got me a job in the mail
                   room, worked up to the Stenographic.
                   Now I'm a reader...

                             GILLIS
                   Come clean, Betty.  At night you
                   weep for those lost closeups, those
                   gala openings...

                             BETTY
                   Not once.  What's wrong with being
                   on the other side of the cameras?
                   It's really more fun.

                             GILLIS
                   Three cheers for Betty Schaefer!
                   I will now kiss that nose of yours.

                             BETTY
                   If you please.

          Gillis kisses her nose.  As he stands there, his
          face close to hers -

                             GILLIS
                   May I say you smell real special.

                             BETTY
                   It must be my new shampoo.

                             GILLIS
                   That's no shampoo.  It'smore like
                   a pile of freehly laundred hand-
                   kerchiefs, like a brand new auto-
                   mobile.  How old are you anyway?

                             BETTY
                   Twenty-two.

                            GILLIS
                 That's it -- there's nothing like
                 being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest
                 that if we're ever to finish this
                 story you keep at least two feet
                 away from me ...  Now back to the
                 typewriter.

          They start walking in the direction of the office.

  E-13    THE GARAGE

          Gillis gets out.  From the seat next him he takes a
          batch of script, folds it and puts it in his pocket.
          He suddenly becomes aware that he is watched, turns.
          Max stands in the moonlight, evidently waiting for
          him.

                            GILLIS
                 What is it, Max? Want to wash
                 the car, or are you doing a little
                 spying in your off hours?

                            MAX
                 You must be very careful as you
                 cross the patio.  Madame may be
                 watching.

                            GILLIS
                 How about my going up the kitchen
                 stairs and undressing in the dark.
                 Will that do it?

                            MAX
                 I'm not inquiring where Mr.
                 Gillis goes every night...

                            GILLIS
                 Why don't you? I'm writing a
                 script and I'm dying to finish
                 it, no matter what.

                            MAX
                 It's just that I'm very worried
                 about Madame.

                            GILLIS
                 Sure you are.  And we're not help-
                 ing her any, feeding her lies and
                 more lies.  Getting herself ready
                 for a pioture ...  What happens when
                 she finds out?

                            MAX
                 She never will.  That is my job.
                 It has been for a long time.  You
                 must understand I discovered her
                 when she was eighteen.  I made her
                 a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.

                            GILLIS
                 You made her a star?

                            MAX
                 I directed all her early pictures.
                 There were three young directors
                 who showed promise in those days:
                 D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and
                 Max von Mayerling.

                            GILLIS
                 And she's turned you into a
                 servant.

                            MAX
                 It was I who asked to come back,
                 humiliating as it may seem.  I
                 could have gone on witn my career,
                 only I found everything unendur-
                 able arter she divorced me.  You
                 see, I was her rirst husband.

          One lamp lit.  Norma, in a white negligee, with the

          small, tormented, pitiable woman.  Finally she opens
          the door to:

          Her eyes fall on Gillis' coat, which hangs over a
          chair.  In a pocket is part of the script.  Norma
          takes it out, looks at it.  She can't see it in the

          Betty is typing.  Gillis sits on the couch, proof-
          reading a scene.  Betty stops typing and Gillis
          becomes aware of her eyes fixed on him.

                            GILLIS
                 Hey, what's the matter...
                 Betty, wake up!

                      catches her attention)
                 Why are you staring at me like that?

                 Was I?  I'm sorry.

                 What's wrong with you tonight?
                 What is it, Betty?

                            BETTY
                 Something came up.  I don't want
                 to talk about it.

                            GILLIS
                 Why not?

                            BETTY

                 Is it about me?

          Betty doesn't answer, walks out on


  E-18    THE BALCONY

          She leans against a post, crying.  Gillis comes out
          after her.

                            GILLIS
                 Betty, there's no use running
                 out on it.  Let's face it, what-
                 ever it is.

                            BETTY
                 It's nothing.  I got a telegram
                 from Artie.

                            GILLIS
                 From Artie.  What's wrong?

                            BETTY
                 He wants me to come on to Arizona.
                 He says it only oosts two dollars
                 to get married there.  It would
                 kind of save us a honeymoon.

                   Of course I love him.  I always
                   will.  I'm just not in love
                   with him any more.

                 What is this anyway?
                      (Taking the phone)
                 This is Betty Schaefer.


  E-23    NORMA AT IHE PHONE

                            NORMA
                 Miss Schaefer, you must forgive
                 me for calling you so late, but
                 I really feel it's my duty.  It's
                 about Mr. Gillis.  You do know Mr.
                 Gillis? ...Exactly how much do you
                 know about him? Do you know where
                 he lives? Do you know how he lives?
                 Do you know what he lives on?


  E-24    BETTY AT THE PHONE

                            BETTY
                 Who are you? What do you want?
                 What business is it of yours
                 anyway?


  E-25    NORMA ON THE PHONE

                            NORMA
                 Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do
                 you a favor.  I'm trying to spare
                 you a great deal of misery.  Of
                 course you may be too young to even
                 suspect there are men of his sort...

                            NORMA (Cont'd)
                 I don't know what he's told you, but
                 he does not live with relatives, nor
                 with friends, in the usual sense of
                 the word.  Ask him ... Ask him again.

          During the latter part of her call, the doors from
          Gillis' room have been pushed open and Gillis has
          walked towards her.  Suddenly Norma senses his pre-
          sence and turns around.  The telephone freezes in her
          hand.  She tries to hang it up.  Very calmly Gillis
          takes the receiver from her hand.

                            GILLIS
                      (Into phone)
                 That's right, Betty, ask me again.
                 This is Joe.


  E-26    BETTY ON THE PHONE

                            BETTY
                 Joe, where are you? What's this
                 all about?


  E-27    GILLIS ON THE PHONE

          Norma beside him.

                            GILLIS
                 Or maybe it would be a better
                 idea if you came over and saw it
                 for yourself.  The address is 10086
                  .

          He hangs up.  Norma looks up at him as he crosses to
          the other end of the room and stands staring at her.
          The silence becomes unbearable.

                            NORMA
                 Don't hate me, Joe.  I did it because
                 I need you.  I need you as I never
                 needed you.  Look at me.  Look at my
                 hands, look at my face, look under my
                 eyes.  How can I go back to work if I'm
                 wasting away under this torment? You
                 don't know what I've been through these
                 last weeks.  I got myself a revolver.
                 You don't believe me, but I did, I did!
                 I stood in front of that mirror, only
                 I couldn't make myself.  It wouldn't be

                            NORMA (Cont'd)
                 fair to all those people who are
                 waiting to see me back on the
                 screen.  I can't disappoint them.
                 Only, if I'm to work, I need
                 sleep, I need quiet, I need you!
                 Don't just stand there hating
                 me! Shout at me, strike me!
                 But don't hate me, Joe.  Don't
                 you hear me, Joe?

                            GILLIS
                 Yes, I hear you.  And I wish you'd
                 keep still so I can hear the doorbell
                 when she rings it.


  E-28    BETTY AND CONNIE, DRIVING IN A SMALL COUPE DOWN
            (NIGHT)


  E-29    INT. COUPE

          Connie is looking at the house numbers.

                            CONNIE
                 Here's ten thousand seventy-nine,
                 Betty.  It must be over there.

          Betty turns the car into the driveway of Norma's
          place, stops at the entrance steps.  Betty gets out.

                            CONNIE
                 Betty, let me come along with
                 you.  Please.

                            BETTY
                 No, I'll be all right.

          She shuts the door of the car and goes up the steps.


  E-30    NORMA'S BEDROOM

          Norma lies on the bed.  Gillis sits in a far corner
          of the room, motionless.

                            NORMA
                      (In a whimpering monotone)
                 I love you, Joe.  I love you, Joe.
                 I love you, Joe.  I love you, Joe.

          There is the sound of footsteps below and the ringing
          of a doorbell.  Gillis rises.

                            NORMA
                 What are you going to do, Joe?

          Without a word, he leaves the room.  Norma raises
          herself on the bed, reaching for a black negligee
          lying at the foot of it.  As she does so, she dis-
          lodges her pillow a little, revealing a revolver
          hidden beneath it.


  E-31    DOWNSTAIRS HALL, THE DESMOND HOUSE (DARK)

          Max crosses the hall, putting on his alpaca jacket.
          He turns on the lights.  Outside stands Betty.
          From the staircase comes -

                            GILLIS' VOICE
                 It's all right, Max.  I'll take it.

                            MAX
                 Yes, sir.

          He stands back as Gillis opens the door.

                            GILLIS
                 Hello, Betty.

                            BETTY
                      (On the threshold)
                 I don't know why I'm so scared,
                 Joe.  Is it something awful?

                            GILLIS
                 Come on in, Betty,

          Betty enters.  As he leads her into the living room,
          Gillis puts his arm around her shoulders.

                            GILLIS
                 Ever been in one of these old
                 Hollywood palazzos? That's from
                 when they were making eighteen thou-
                 sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful
                 of these tiles, they're slippery.
                 Valentino used to dance here.

                            BETTY
                 This is where you live?

                            GILLIS
                 You bet.

                            BETTY
                 Whose house is it?

          They have reached


  E-32    THE LIVING ROOM

          Gillis leads Betty in.

                            GILLIS
                 Hers.

                            BETTY
                 Whose?

                            GILLIS
                 Just look around.  There's a lot
                 of her spread about.  If you don't
                 remember the face, you must have
                 heard the name of Norma Desmond.

                            BETTY
                 That was Norma Desmond on the phone?

                            GILLIS
                 Want something to drink?  There's
                 always champagne on ice, and plenty
                 of caviar.

                            BETTY
                 Why did she call me?

                            GILLIS
                 Jealous.  Ever see so much junk?
                 She had the ceiling brought from
                 Portugal.  Look at this.

          He pulls the rope, showing the projection screen
          under the picture.

                            GILLIS
                 Her own movie theatre.

                            BETTY
                 I didn't come here to see a house.
                 What about Norma Desmond?

                            GILLIS
                 I'm trying to tell you.  This is
                 an enormous place.  Eight master
                 bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every
                 bathroom.  There's a bowling alley
                 in the cellar.  It's lonely here,
                 so she got herself a companion.
                 A very simple set-up: An older
                 woman who is well-to-do.  A younger
                 man who is not doing too well ...
                 Can you figure it out yourself?

                            BETTY
                 No.

                            GILLIS
                 All right.  I'll give you a few
                 more clues.

                            BETTY
                 No, no! I haven't heard any of
                 this.  I never got those telephone
                 calls.  I've never been in this
                 house ... Get your things together.
                 Let's get out of here.

                            GILLIS
                 All my things? All the eighteen
                 suits, all the custom-made shoes and
                 the eighteen dozen shirts, and the
                 cuff-links and the platinum key-
                 chains, and the cigarette cases?

                            BETTY
                 Come on, Joe.

                            GILLIS
                 Come on where? Back to a one-room
                 apartment that I can't pay for?
                 Back to a story that may sell and
                 very possibly will not?

                            BETTY
                 If you love me, Joe.

                            GILLIS
                 Look, sweetie -- be practical.
                 l've got a good thing here.
                 A long-term contract with no options.
                 I like it that way.  Maybe it's not
                 very admirable.  Well, you and Artie
                 can be admirable.

                            BETTY
                 Joe, I can't look at you any more.

                            GILLIS
                 Nobody asked you to.

          Betty turns from him, to hide the fact that she is
          crying.

                            GILLIS
                 All right, baby.  This way out.

          He leads her in the direction of the door.

  E-33    UPPER LANDING, DESMOND HOUSE

          Sitting crouched behind the balustrade is Norma,
          peering down into


  E-34    THE LOWER HALL

          Betty and Gillis have reached the entrance door.
          Gillis opens it.

                            GILLIS
                 Good luck to you, Betty.  You can
                 finish that story on the way to
                 Arizona.  When you and Artie get
                 back, if the two of you ever feel
                 like a swim, here's the pool ...

          He switches on the light.


  E-35    THE PATIO

          The lights go on in the pool, which shines brilliant-
          ly in the dark garden.


  E-36    BETTY

          She doesn't even look.  Her eyes filled with tears,
          she runs down the entrance porch toward her car.


  E-37    THE ENTRANCE HALL

          Gillis looks after her, closes the door.  From the
          upper landing comes the sound of soft sobbing.  He
          looks up.


  E-38    NORMA, ON THE UPPER LANDING

          Gillis ascends the stairs.

                            NORMA
                 Thank you, Joe -- thank you, Joe.

          She tries to take his hand to kiss it as he passes.
          He doesn't stop.  Norma catches his coat.  Gillis
          moves right on into his room.  Norma lies on the
          floor looking after him.  She crawls toward a con-
          sole, pulls herself up by it, starts towards Gillis'
          door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves
          back to the mirror and takes the patches off her
          face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with
          her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor
          travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis'
          room.

                            NORMA
                 May I come in?  I've stopped cry-
                 ing.  I'm all right again.  Joe,
                 tell me you're not cross -- tell
                 me everything is just as it was,
                 Joe.

          She opens the door.


  E-39    GILLIS' ROOM

          In the foreground, open on the bed, is a half-packed
          suitcase, Gillis just putting some of his old shirts
          in.  Norma stands staring, speechless, for a second.
          Gillis moves out of the shot towards the closets.

                            NORMA
                 What are you doing, Joe?  What
                 are you doing?  You're not leaving
                 me?

                            GILLIS
                 Yes, I am, Norma.

                            NORMA
                 No, you're not.
                      (Calling)
                 Max! Max!

                            GILLIS
                 Max is a good idea.  He can help
                 with my luggage.
                      (He gestures in the
                       direction of the closet)
                 Thanks for letting me wear the
                 handsome wardrobe.  And thanks
                 for the use of all the trinkets.

          He takes the cigarette case and throws it on the
          chaise longue.  Then he throws the lighter, the
          wrist watch, the platinum key-chain and the tie clip.

                            GILLIS
                      (Indicating the bureau)
                 The rest of the jewelry is in the
                 top drawer.

                            NORMA
                 It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to
                 you.

                            GILLIS
                 And I'd take it in a second, Norma --
                 only it's a little too dressy for
                 sitting behind the copy desk in
                 Dayton, Ohio.

                            NORMA
                 These are nothing.  You can have
                 anything you want if you'll only
                 stay.  What is it you want --
                 money?

                            GILLIS
                 Norma, you'd be throwing it away.
                 I don't qualify for the job, not any
                 more.

                            NORMA
                 You can't do this!  Max!  Max!
                 ... I can't face life without you,
                 and I'm not afraid to die, you
                 know.

                            GILLIS
                 That's between you and yourself,
                 Norma.

                            NORMA
                 You think I made that up about
                 the gun...

          She rushes into her room.  Gillis closes the suitcase
          calmly, notices that he is still wearing some cuff-
          links Norma gave him, takes them off.

          Norma reappears in the door, carrying the revolver.

                            NORMA
                 See, you didn't believe me!..
                 Now I suppose you don't think I
                 have the courage!

                            GILLIS
                 Oh.  sure -- if it would make a
                 good scene.

                            NORMA
                 You don't care.  do you?  But
                 hundreds of thousands of people
                 will carel

                            GILLIS
                 Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing
                 yourself to an empty house.  The
                 audience left twenty years ago.
                 Now face it.

          During the preceding.  Max has entered.  He stands
          listening, paralyzed.

                             NORMA
                  That's a lie!  They still want me!

                             GILLIS
                  No, they don't.

                             NORMA
                  What about the studio?
                  What about De Mille?

                             GILLIS
                  He was trying to spare your feelings.
                  The studio wanted to rent your car.

                             NORMA
                  Wanted what?

                             GILLIS
                  De Mille didn't have the heart
                  to tell you.  None of us has had
                  the heart.

                             NORMA
                  That's a lie!  They want me, they
                  want me!  I get letters every day!

                             GILLIS
                  You tell her, Max.  Come on, do
                  her that favor.  Tell her there
                  isn't going to be any picture --
                  there aren't any fan letters,
                  except the ones you write yourself.

                             NORMA
                  That isn't true! Max?

                             MAX
                  Madame is the greatest star of
                  them all...  I will take Mr.
                  Gillis' bags.

          He leaves.

                             NORMA
                  You heard him.  I'm a star!

                             GILLIS
                  Norma, grow up.  You're a woman
                  of fifty.  There's nothing tragic
                  about being fifty - not unless
                  you try to be twenty-five.

                             NORMA
                   I'm the greatest star of them
                   all.

                             GILLIS
                   Goodbye.  Norma.

                             NORMA
                   No one leaves a star.  That
                   makes one a star.

          Gillis picks up the typewriter and leaves.

                             NORMA
                   You're not leaving me!


  E-40    STAIRCASE

          Gillis descending with the typewriter.

                             NORMA'S VOICE
                   Joe! ...Joe!

          There is the SOUND OF A SHOT.  The glass of the front
          door is shattered.  Gillis at the door opens it and
          walks out, without looking back.

          Down the staircase rushes Norma.  a disordered wild-
          ness in the way she moves.

                             NORMA
                   You're not leaving me!

          She hurries after Gillis.


  E-41    PATIO (NIGHT)

          Dark except for lights from the house and the
          luminousness of the lit pool.

          Gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage.  He
          is carrying the typewriter.  He doesn't accelerate
          his step, although he has heard the shot.  Behind
          him Norma comes from the lighted house.

                             NORMA
                   You're not leaving me!

          She shoots twice in rapid succession.  Gillis drops
          the typewriter.  The shots have swung him around.  He
          is now facing Norma.  She shoots him.  This shot
          hits him in the belly.  He doubles up, instinctively
          backs away from her, plummets into the lit pool.

          Up the stone steps from the garage rushes Max.
          He sees the situation, hurries towards Norma, who
          stands exultant in the strange light from the pool.

                             NORMA
                   Stars are ageless, aren't they?

          DISSOLVE TO:


  E-42    THE PATIO

          Dawn is breaking.  At the edge of the pool
          stand policemen, detectives and police photographers.
          Motorcycle policemen are holding off the mob which
          is trying to storm the house.

          A lietuenant from the Homicide Bureau leaves the
          crowd around the pool and goes into


  E-43    THE LOWER HALL, DESMOND HOUSE

          It is filled with a pandemonium of police officers,
          newspaper people, etc.  who are kept from the upper
          floor by two policemen at the head of the stairs.
          The lieutenant from the Homicide Bureau goes
          through the crowd to the telephone at the foot of
          the stairs, picks up the phone and dials.

                             LIEUTENANT
                   Coroner's office? ... I want to
                   speak to the Coroner ... Who's
                   on this phone?


  E-44    THE WHITE TELEPHONE IN NORMA'S BEDROOM

          Standing talking into it is Hedda Hopper.

                             MISS HOPPER
                   I am! Now get off, this is more
                   important ... Times City Desk?
                   Hedda Hopper speaking.  I'm talking
                   from the bedroom of Norma Desmond.

                   this direct.  Ready? -- As day breaks
                   over the murder house, Norma Desmond,
                   famed star of yesteryear, is in
                   a state of complete mental shock ...

          THE CAMERA PANS TO ANOTHER PART OF THE BEDROOM, where
          Norma sits at a mirror, staring at herself blankly.
          Firing questions at her are the Captain of the Holmby
          Hills Division and the L.A.  Homicide Squad.  Max
          stands by faithfully.

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                  You do not deny having killed
                  this man, Miss Desmond?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                  Did you intend to kill him?
                  Just answer me that.

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                  Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there
                  been any trouble between you before?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                  If it was a quarrel, how come you
                  had the gun right there?

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                  This guy -- where did you meet him
                  for the first time?  Where did he
                  come from? Who is he?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                  Did he have a wife?  Did he had a
                  girl friend?  Did you know them?

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                  Had he been trying to blackmail you?

  E-46    NORMA'S BEDROOM

          The interrogators are still firing questions at Norma
          who sits lifeless, staring at herself.  Max watches.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Did the deceased ever threaten you?
                 Were you in fear of bodily injury?

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                 Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought
                 of doing something like this before?

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Was theft involved?  Did you catch
                 him trying to steal something, or
                 find he had stolen something?

          A police lieutenant has entered, goes to the Head of
          Homicide.

                            LIEUTENANT
                 The newsreel guys have arrived with
                 the cameras.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Tell them to go fly a kite.  This
                 is no time for cameras.

          A word has pierced the mists that surround Norma.

                            NORMA
                 Cameras? ...What is it, Max?

                            MAX
                 The cameras have arrived, Madame.

                            NORMA
                 They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell
                 Mr. DeMille I will be on the set
                 at once.

          Max flashes a look at the Head of Homicide.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 What is this?

                            MAX
                 Please ...

                            HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
                      (sotto voce, to Head of Homicide)
                 Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.

                            HEAD OF HOMICIDE
                 Okay.  And let's have the car right
                 outside.

  7-1                       NORMA
                 You will pardon me, gentlemen.
                 I have to get ready for my scene.

          She takes a comb and runs it through her hair, then
          starts applying some wild makeup.


  E-47    STAIRCASE AND LOWER HALL

          Max makes his way down the stairs through the crowd
          of newsmen to the newsreel cameras, which are being
          set up in the hall below.

                            MAX
                  Is everything set up, gentlemen?
                  Are the lights ready?

          From the stairway comes a murnur.  They look up.

          Norma has emerged from the bedroom and comes to the
          head of the stairs.  There are golden spangles in
          her hair and in her hand she carries a golden scarf.

          The police clear a path for her to descend.  Press
          cameras flash at her every step.

          Max stands at the cameras.

                            MAX
                  Is everything set up, gentlemen?

                            CAMERAMAN
                  Just about.

          The portable lights flare up and illuminate the
          staircase.

                  Are the lights ready?

                            MAX
                  Quiet, everybody!  Lights!
                  Are you ready, Norma?

                       stairs)
                  What is the scene? Where am I?

                            MAX
                  This is the staircase of the palace.

                             NORMA
                 Oh, yes, yes.  They're below,
                 waiting for the Princess ...
                 I'm ready.

                             MAX
                 All right.

          At the foot of the stairs Norma stops, moved.

                            NORMA
                 I can't go on with the scene.
                 I'm too happy.  Do you mind,
                 Mr. DeMille, if I say a few words?
                 Thank you.  I just want to tell
                 you how happy I am to be back in
                 the studio making a picture again.
                 You don't know how much I've missed
                 all of you.  And I promise you
                 I'll never desert you again, because
                 after "Salome" we'll make another
                 picture, and another and another.
                 You see, this is my life.  It always
                 will be.  There's nothing else -
                 just us and the cameras and those
                 wonderful people out there in the
                 dark...  All right, Mr. DeMille,
                 I'm ready for my closeup.

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END

                 THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS

FADE IN:

EXT. INT. GLOBE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DUSK - N.Y.

A row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the
long loading bay, waiting for the edition.  In the foreground
a large clock establishes the time as 8:10 PM. A rumbling
noise warns the men to take their positions; a few seconds
later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes
onto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto
the trucks.  Much noise and shouting.

The front truck moves out to the city street.  As it does
CAMERA EMPHASIZES the big poster on its side.  The design
features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims - a
trademark of Hunsecker's. (It will later be seen as the
masthead of the gossip column.)

                     "GO WITH THE GLOBE"

                            Read

                       J.J. HUNSECKER

                   "They eyes of Broadway"

EXT. BROADWAY - DUSK - N.Y.

The truck starts on its journey along Broadway.  Some shots
are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic (taken
from a camera car).  Others are from the inside of the
truck; as it slows down, the delivery man tosses the heavy
bundle of papers onto the sidewalk.  CAMERA following the
truck, holds it in foreground against the blazing electric
signs of Broadway and Times Square.

EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

The southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and
46th Street, CAMERA, fairly high, shoots north towards the
impressive vista of electric signs, silhouetted against the
darkening sky.  Very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks.
CAMERA descends towards the Orange Juice stand on the
corner, passing the booth which sells souvenir hats.  It
moves through the congestion of chattering passersby,
steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man, who stands
at the counter of the Orange Juice stand.  Oblivious of the
hub-bub around him, SIDNEY FALCO is concerned only with his
private problems.

He turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb
behind him; this is what he has been waiting for...

CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT

The news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the
sidewalk besides a newsstand.

DETAIL

The bundle of newspapers.  It hits the sidewalk with a smack.
CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney Falco crosses the sidewalk.  The
owner of the newsstand, IGGY, comes to pick up the bundle;
he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor;
Sidney snaps his fingers with impatience.  Iggy wears
spectacles and is clearly more or less blind, he has to
grope for the cord that binds the papers.

                         IGGY
            Aw Lady, if I looked like you, I'd--

                         SIDNEY
            C'mon...C'mon...

                         IGGY
                   (recognizing Sidney's voice)
            Keep ya sweatshirt on, Sidney.

Majestically taking his time, Iggy lifts the bundle to his
stand and cuts the cord.

                         IGGY
            Hey, Fresh, the Globe just came
            in -- Hey, Sidney, want an item for
            Hunsecker's column?  Two rolls get
            fresh with a baker!  Hey, hot, hot,
            hot -- etc.

Annoyed, Sidney throws him a dime, seizes a paper and
returns briskly to the orange juice stand.

ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

Sidney's place at the crowded counter has been taken by
newcomers.  Rudely, he recovers his half-consumed glass of
orange juice and sandwich.  He takes them further down the
counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the
paper.  CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM, picks up further snatches of
overheard dialogue. (See dialogue attached at the end of the
scene) We move close enough to see Sidney's hands open the
paper expertly at HUNSECKER'S column - identifiable by the
picture of the spectacled eyes.  Over scene there is a
babble of offstage dialogue.

CLOSE UP OF SIDNEY

His face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column.
He is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment.

EXT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - BROADWAY - NIGHT

CAMERA SHOOTS WEST on 46th Street, as Sidney comes down the
side street from the newsstand in background.  Irritably, he
jerks open the door of a shabby entrance.  As the glass door
closes, Sidney is seen striding up the stairs.

FIRST FLOOR - OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Beside the top of the stairs is the door to Sidney's office.
On it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads:

SIDNEY FALCO

Publicity

From inside comes the sound of desultory typing.  Sidney
comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door.

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SALLY is on the phone as Sidney strides in.

                         SALLY
            Just a minute, Mr. Weldon.  I
            think...

Sidney vigorously indicates that he doesn't want to take the
call.

                         SALLY
                   (to phone)
            I'm sorry.  I thought that was Mr.
            Falco returning.  Yes, I'll tell
            him when he comes in.  I know he's
            been trying to reach you.

She hangs up.

                         SALLY
            That's the third time he's called
            today.

                         SIDNEY
            He wants me to break a leg?

                         SALLY
                   (literally)
            No, an arm, he said.
                   (then)
            I told him you were sure the item
            would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column
            in tomorrow's...

                         SIDNEY
                   (interrupting, sharply)
            It isn't.  I've just seen the early
            edition.

                         SALLY
            But...

                         SIDNEY
            But what?

                         SALLY
            That makes five days in a row that
            Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his
            column.

                         SIDNEY
            May I rent you out as an adding
            machine.

He has begun to change his clothes.

                         SIDNEY
            Get me Joe Robard.

Sally goes back into the outer room.

                         SIDNEY
            Who else phoned?

                         SALLY
            The renting agent and the tailor.

                         SIDNEY
            Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.

                         SALLY
            It won't leave much of a balance in
            the bank...
                   (to phone)
            Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?

Sidney, in a state of semi-undress, comes to take the phone
from her.

                         SIDNEY
                   (gloomily)
            Watch me run a fifty yard dash with
            my legs cut off!

Very abruptly, he comes alive on the phone.  A real laughing
boy.

                         SIDNEY
                   (effusively)
            Sidney, Joe.  How do you like it?
            I'm running out of alibis!  No, I
            asked Hunsecker to withhold the
            item, until he could give it a
            fine, fat paragraph.  The column
            was running over and I didn't want
            you kissed off with just a line...

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Robard is a stolid, secure man, balding and with a moustache.
He has a morose sense of humor.  He is speaking from a
telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar.  In
background, the Club is open, but there are few customers as
yet.  Some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians
are still arriving, strolling past in background, depositing
their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned
to them.

                         ROBARD
                   (in answer to Sidney)
            Of course.
                   (he listens to
                   protest from Sidney)
            What is this, Sidney, a kissing
            game?  You're a liar - that's a
            publicity man's nature.  I wouldn't
            hire you if you wasn't a liar.  I
            pay you a C-and-a-half a week
            wherein you plant big lies about me
            and the Club all over the map.
                   (a pause)
            Yeah, I mean in that sense.  But
            also in the sense that you are a
            personal liar, too, because you
            don't do the work I pay you for.
                   (new protests on the
                   other end of the line)
            Oh, stop it, Sidney.  You're from
            the country, not me.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sally is watching him, unhappy on his behalf.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Now, wait a minute, Joe.  When I
            saw J.J. last night he said...

But Robard has cut off.  Sidney hangs up.  A silence.  Sally
tries to be comforting.

                         SALLY
            I wish I could help in some way,
            Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
                   (aggressively)
            Help me with two minutes of silence!

Sally, hurt, says nothing.  Presently, he adds:

                         SIDNEY
            Go home, Sally.  It's late...

                         SALLY
            I hate to see you like this --

Sidney, with another mercurial change of manner, begins some
sarcastic clowning.

                         SIDNEY
                   (horsing around)
            Yes, but as a new subscriber you're
            under no obligation to take more
            than three books.  And if you mail
            the enclosed card within ten days --

                         SALLY
                   (pleadingly)
            Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't
            do a dance with me...

                         SIDNEY
                   (still clowning)
            You mean you don't want the extra
            free gift of a colorful giant map
            of the world???

                         SALLY
                   (distressed)
            Sidney, please, dear, if you feel
            nervous...

Sidney is abruptly savage.

                         SIDNEY
                   (with cruelty)
            So what'll you do if I feel nervous?
            You'll open your meaty, sympathetic
            arms...?

                         SALLY
                   (breaking down)
            Sid...you got me so...I don't know
            what...

She is crying.  Sidney feels uncomfortable.  Not too
generously, he relents:

                         SIDNEY
            You ought to be used to me by now.

                         SALLY
                   (pathetically)
            I'm used to you...

                         SIDNEY
                   (with a touch of bitterness)
            No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no
            hero.  I'm nice to people where it
            pays me to be.  I gotta do it too
            much on the outside, so don't
            expect me to kow-tow in my own
            office.  I'm in a bind right now
            with Hunsecker so --
                   (grimly)
            Every dog has his day!
                   (going)
            Lock up and leave the key.

The phone rings.  Sidney is dressed by now.  As Sally goes
for it, he makes for the outer door.

                         SIDNEY
            If that's for me, tear it up!

                         SALLY
            Take a top coat.

                         SIDNEY
            And leave a tip in every hat-check
            room in town?

He is already gone as she picks up the phone.

                         SALLY
            Sidney Falco office... Oh, Miss
            Kay, he tried to reach you.  No,
            he's at the barbers now.  No,
            that's held over till the Tuesday
            column...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ELYSIAN ROOM - NIGHT

The quintet.  As the dissolve clears, a clatter of polite
applause greets the end of a previous number.  CAMERA is on
the bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five
musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the
leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo
to...the bass, who "walks" with the beat, bringing in...the
drums, which start a quiet, insistent wire-brush background
for...the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases,
set the stage for...

STEVE DALLAS

...the guitar, the leader again.  It comes in after this
short preamble with the first statement of melody. (The tune
has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the
themes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the
background score of the title music.) CAMERA lingers a
moment on the guitarist, STEVE DALLAS.  He is a youth of
pleasant, intelligent appearance.  He plays with the intent
air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work
very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in
the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening
audience.

SIDNEY

A close shot.  Sidney has just entered the club, strolling
into the vestibule near the entrance.  He wears an expression
of oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward...

DALLAS

Seen in long shot from Sidney's viewpoint.  CAMERA moves to
include Sidney in foreground again.  He turns as he is
accosted by RITA, the cigarette girl of the club.  She is a
pert creature, attractive and not unaware of the fact.

                         RITA
            Don't you ever get messages,
            Eyelashes?  I called you twice.

                         SIDNEY
                   (irked)
            I've been up to here.  Listen,
            honey, tell me something.  You know
            Susan Hunsecker...?
                   (Rita nods)
            Has she been in?  I mean lately, in
            the last coupla days...?

                         RITA
            I don't think so.

                         SIDNEY
            You're sure.  Find out for me.

                         RITA
                   (with a nod)
            Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?

Rita wears an injured air.  Sidney, preoccupied with other
worries, callously ignores it.

                         SIDNEY
            Is Frank D'Angelo around?

                         RITA
            At the bar - Sidney...

But Sidney has moved away from her.

D'ANGELO

He is at the bar, listening with satisfaction to the music,
watching the performers and studying the audience.  Sidney
comes up behind him.  We see Sidney's eyes flick from
D'Angelo towards the bandstand and back again.  Then, as he
takes the stool next to D'Angelo, he assumes a different
manner, a sulky resentment.  D'Angelo sees Sidney.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (to the bartender)
            Joe, give my nephew a drink.

                         SIDNEY
                   (sullen)
            Your nephew doesn't want a drink.

D'Angelo is still watching the quintet.  The guitar can be
heard again.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Shooting past D'Angelo and Sidney towards the bandstand.

                         D'ANGELO
            That's a lollipop that, boy.  The
            kid is only great.

                         SIDNEY
            And with ten percent of his future,
            you're great, too, Frank.

D'Angelo looks quickly at Sidney, sensing the undercurrent.
Then he turns his back on the musicians, remarking in a
quiet tone.

                         D'ANGELO
            Went over to Philly yesterday an'
            seen the folks...it's nice you send
            them the fifty a month...

                         SIDNEY
                   (after a pause)
            See my mother?

                         D'ANGELO
                   (shaking his head)
            I only had a few hours.

A glum moment.  Frank sips his highball: Sidney lights a
cigarette, animosity on his face.

                         D'ANGELO
            Thanks for the publicity spread you
            got the boys for the benefit
            tomorrow.

                         SIDNEY
                   (begrudgingly)
            Robard's my client.  I did it for
            him and his club, not your boys.

Frank again notes Sidney's resentful manner.  Sidney looks
towards the musicians.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quietly)
            Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (quietly)
            Looka, Sidney, you're my own
            sister's son, but where does that
            give you the right to call me a liar?

                         SIDNEY
                   (looking towards Steve)
            You told me that your boy was
            washed up with Susie Hunsecker,
            didn't you?

                         D'ANGELO
            Yeah, and it's the truth, to the
            best of my knowledge.  And, frankly,
            I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm
            glad, not yours.  I manage these
            boys and I got their best interests
            at heart.  Steve shouldn't get
            mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

                         SIDNEY
                   (narrowly)
            You told him that?

                         D'ANGELO
            Not in those exact words - you know
            what a temper he's got.

A pause.  Sidney is thinking.

                         SIDNEY
            When do these hot-headed boys of
            yours go on the road?

                         D'ANGELO
            Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.

                         SIDNEY
            That's a nice tour.  All booked?
                   (Frank nodding)
            When was Susie around here last?

                         D'ANGELO
            Four five nights ago.  That's how I
            know the romance is off.  Also
            Steve's in a very bad mood.

                         SIDNEY
                   (abruptly)
            Listen, Frank, you'd better make
            sure you're telling me the truth.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (annoyed)
            I don't like this threatening
            attitude.  When it comes to it,
            what the heck is it your business
            what they do, this boy and girl...

RITA

Locating Sidney, she comes up behind him.  He turns away
from D'Angelo as she whispers to him.  As she departs,
Sidney turns back.

                         SIDNEY
            If you knew Hunsecker as well as I
            did, you might understand why it's
            my business.  Maybe you're walking
            around blind, Frank, without a cane.

Sidney gets off his stool.  Casually, but to effect, he adds:

                         SIDNEY
            ...and in case you didn't know it,
            Susie Hunsecker's out there on the
            back step right now.

He turns away, glancing towards Steve on the bandstand
behind him.

D'ANGELO

He looks disturbed.

INT./EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD

From D'Angelo's point of view.  CAMERA LOOKS UP at Steve.
The Quintet is now reaching the end of the number, a driving
rhythm of considerable excitement.  A waiter passes in f.g.
and the CAMERA CRANES BACK through the curtained doorway to
the backstage part of the club.  This movement is continued
as we see some other employees, including Jerry Wiggins, the
intermission pianist, who is waiting in the corridor near
the fire-exit.  As he steps out of the door to discard a
cigarette, CAMERA AGAIN CONTINUES ITS MOVEMENT, CRANING BACK
AND DOWNWARD into the little courtyard.  Here, it discovers
the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow
near the steps of the fire-escape, listening to the music.

CLOSER ANGLE

This is SUSAN HUNSECKER.  She wears an expensive mink coat.
It is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is
sensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic.  A girl
in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her
capacity.  Over scene, the music continues.  Susan shifts
her position, knowing that the session will soon be at an
end and that the musicians will be coming backstage.

INT. ELYSIAN ROOM

Steve is playing the last bars of the number; the whole
group now in unison.

QUINTET

The music comes sharply, dramatically to its finish.  There
is some applause.  The boys relax.  Steve reaches for the
microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of
the "cool" musician, announces the end of the set, thanking
the audience, identifying the quintet by name and introducing
the intermission pianist.  During this, Carson, Chico and
Paul wander off the bandstand behind him.

EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD

Chico, Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage.
As they do so, Chico, glancing out of the open door sees
Susan in the courtyard.  He goes out onto the fire-escape;
Paul following behind.

                         CHICO
            Hi!  Susie...

                         SUSAN
            Hello, Chico.  Paul.

                         CHICO
                   (to Paul)
            Throw a rope round this chick while
            I go get Steve.

Chico goes swiftly back into the club.  Paul remains with
Susan.  There is a momentary silence; Paul is embarrassed
because Susan is.  Susan makes an effort at conversation,
she nods towards the club.

                         SUSAN
            Full house...?

                         PAUL
            Packin' 'em in.

INT. CLUB

Steve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles, a
much-too-earnest devotee of progressive jazz.

                         DEVOTEE
            I'm terribly interested in jazz --
            serious jazz.  You studied with
            Milhaud, didn't you?  This is such
            an interesting fusion of the
            traditional, classical form with
            the new progressive style, I just
            wanted to ask you how you came to
            form the group...-

CHICO

He comes through the curtains of the doorway, pausing as he
sees that Steve is involved with the Intellectual Young Woman.

REVERSE ANGLE

Steve glancing at Chico over the shoulder of the Intellectual
Young Woman.  Seeing that Chico has something to say to him,
he wriggles out of the young woman's clutches by passing the
buck to the unfortunate to Fred Katz, who is descending from
the bandstand behind him.

                         STEVE
            Well, we just sort of got together.
                   (turning to introduce Fred)
            Maybe if you ask Mr. Katz...He
            writes the stuff, you know.

                         FRED
                   (blankly)
            Huh?

RESUME CHICO

Steve joins Chico and they go through the curtains into the
corridor outside.

CORRIDOR

Chico, smiling, explains:

                         CHICO
            Don't waste your time there, man.
            You've got something better waiting
            outside...
                   (as Steve looks at him)
            Susie's out there.

STEVE

His reaction betrays some emotion. (Over scene the
intermission pianist has begun to play a Blues number.)
Steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard,
then hesitates - almost as if he was afraid to go out.  He
meets Chico's eye again.

                         STEVE
            What did she say...?

CHICO

He is amused, but sympathetic.

                         CHICO
            You proposed to her, not me.
                   (slapping him on the back)
            Go get your answer...

COURTYARD

Susan, waiting at the foot of the iron steps, turns as Steve
comes out on the fire escape above.  Steve comes quickly
down the steps towards her, slowing down when he gets a few
paces away from her.

SUSAN

She looks up at Steve.

STEVE

A CLOSE SHOT.  In his expression we read his mute inquiry...

RESUME SUSAN

Quite deliberately, with her eyes moistened by love and
affection...she nods.

REVERSE ANGLE

Great relief and happiness can be seen in the boy's face.
After a moment, he moves to her and she to him.  They
embrace swiftly, hold each other close and then kiss with
passion.  Presently, when the kiss is over, Susan speaks
softly.

                         SUSAN
                   (in a whisper)
            Steve...I'll...I'll try to make a
            good wife.

Steve is still too choked with relief to speak.  For answer,
he clasps her more tightly to him.  The beam of light which
falls on the iron stairs behind them, narrows and then is
extinguished...

CORRIDOR

Paul has closed the door.  Turning, he shares a look with
the grinning Chico and Fred Katz who has managed to escape
from the young woman.  Before there is time for either of
them to make a remark, Sidney comes through the curtains
from the Club.

                         SIDNEY
            Hi, Fellows.  Where's the Chief?

Sidney's manner is very friendly.  But it is immediately
apparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none
of them likes Sidney.  Fred is deliberately uncomprehending.

                         FRED
            Who?

                         SIDNEY
                   (who gets the point)
            Dallas.  Is he around?

Chico's back is to the closed door which opens onto the
courtyard.  Chico nods in the opposite direction towards the
stairs.

                         CHICO
                   (unhelpfully)
            Yeah, he's around somewhere.
            Upstairs, maybe.

                         SIDNEY
                   (coldly, as he goes)
            Thanks.

COURTYARD

Steve and Susan are still embracing.  Steve is exultantly
proud and happy.

                         STEVE
                   (incoherent)
            This is big, you know.  Very big!
            Let's go out later, drink some
            firewater.  With the boys.  Fred
            can call Millie and -

                         SUSAN
            Steve, I'd rather you didn't say
            anything for a day or two...until I
            tell my brother...

STEVE

His sobering reaction shows this is something important.

                         STEVE
                   (gently)
            You haven't told him yet...

SUSAN

                         SUSAN
            I'm telling him in the morning
            after breakfast.

STEVE AND SUSAN

Turning her head, she makes a little gesture, an unconscious
movement, putting her fingers to her brow as if feeling a
headache.

                         STEVE
            He isn't going to like it.

Susan says nothing.  She looks to Steve, smiling, but the
smile is not too confident.

                         STEVE
            You sure you don't want me to be
            with you...?

Susan stoutly shakes her head.  Defensively she reassures
Steve:

                         SUSAN
            Steve, my brother isn't as bad as
            he's painted.  He isn't perfect,
            but -

                         STEVE
            But he isn't going to like this,
            Susie.  And he makes you nervous,
            not me.  No, I take that back - he
            makes me nervous, too.  But I
            wouldn't give him a second thought
            if not for you.

The topic evidently makes Susan uneasy.  In an effort to
dismiss something that she does not want to think about,
Susan puts her arms around Steve's neck again.

                         SUSAN
            Let's forget him and -

But Steve is not so ready to change the subject.

                         STEVE
            His stooge, Falco, is around - I
            saw him walk in.
                   (soberly)
            He's been spying on me for weeks,
            Susie.

                         SUSAN
                   (quickly, perhaps too quickly)
            Darling, I don't care - really I
            don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush
            on me for years, but nothing we do
            is his business -

                         STEVE
                   (gently insisting)
            But he could be reporting back to
            your brother, couldn't he?

                         SUSAN
                   (pleading)
            Steve, dear, please forget all of
            this.  What can it matter after
            tomorrow?

Now Steve responds.  He grins, holds her closer.

                         STEVE
                   (softly)
            I have a message for you; I love
            you.
                   (kissing her lightly)
            May I dedicate the next number to
            you?...And the next, and the next.
            Every Sunday I'll buy you a new
            bonnet -

                         SUSAN
                   (amused, but moved)
            If the stores are open -

                         STEVE
            And on Monday, I'll take it off and
            stroke your light brown hair and -

                         SUSAN
            And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer.
                         STEVE
                   (abruptly grinning)
            How do you think I realized I love
            you?

                         SUSAN
            I made you write a beautiful song...

                         STEVE
            No, you had me eating that Chinese
            food!...

They laugh and enjoyably; but then, as the CAMERA MOVES, we
realize that Sidney is there on the fire escape above them;
his manner is affable.

                         SIDNEY
            Can more than two enjoy this joke...
                   (to Susan)
            Hello, Susie, I didn't expect to
            find you here.

Steve says nothing.  But he obviously resents the intrusion
and finds it difficult to conceal the fact.  Sidney comes
down the fire escape towards them.

                         SIDNEY
            Where's those glossy prints you
            promised?  Tonight's the latest I
            can place them -

                         STEVE
                   (barely polite)
            Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget
            it.
                   (to Susan)
            It's cold out here, Susie.

Steve makes a move to lead Susan back inside.  It is a
gesture which appears to dismiss Sidney.  Sidney chooses to
take umbrage:

                         SIDNEY
                   (lightly sarcastic)
            Let me apologize for getting you
            that press spread.  It's been an
            honor to serve you gratis.

Steve turns to Sidney; his manner is quiet but challenging:

                         STEVE
                   (levelly)
            I get the feeling, Falco, that
            you're always snooping around...

                         SUSAN
                   (quickly intervening)
            Steve, stop it please...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Frank D'Angelo has followed Sidney out onto the fire escape;
other members of the Quintet have also appeared.

                         D'ANGELO
            What are you boys fighting about?

Aggressively indignant, Sidney throws up his hands; he
knocks on the metal of the fire escape.

                         SIDNEY
                   (sarcastic)
            Kill me!  Find me a door somewhere -
            I walked in without knocking!

Sidney is trying to needle Steve; Steve's temper would
normally have exploded; but now he controls it.

                         STEVE
            I'm feeling too good to fight with
            you, but that isn't what I said - I
            said you snoop.  For instance, what
            were you doing around my hotel the
            other night?

                         SIDNEY
                   (needling)
            Begging your pardon, I haven't been
            down the bowery in years!

                         D'ANGELO
                   (soothingly)
            Come on boys, break it up...

                         STEVE
                   (overriding D'Angelo)
            The next time you want information,
            Falco, don't scratch for it like a
            dog - ask for it like a man!

SIDNEY

His face tightens; he appears to be mortally insulted and
controlling himself with difficulty.  He turns his back
swiftly on Steve, addressing Susan in a voice that has a
sharp edge.

                         SIDNEY
            If you're going home, Susie, I'll
            drop you off...

Sidney starts quickly up the fire escape.  This makes Steve
angry and he steps forward to follow him.  But Chico
contrives, without seeming to interfere to obstruct Steve.

                         CHICO
                   (easily)
            Time for the next set, Chief...

                         STEVE
            Just a minute, Chico.

CORRIDOR

Sidney comes inside.  When he is out of sight or the group
in the courtyard, his manner swiftly changes.  It's obvious
now that his indignation was assumed; now he looks back
towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes;
he is assessing Steve's temper.  But, presently, seeing
D'Angelo and the boys returning, he moves back to the
curtains into the Club.

COURTYARD

As D'Angelo and the other boys go inside, Steve turns back
to Susan.

                         STEVE
                   (fondly)
            Just so you don't leave me in a
            minor key.

INT. CLUB

Rita has succeeded in recapturing Sidney near the entrance
to the club.  Sidney, alert and interested, listens to her
while keeping his eye on the bandstand in b.g. where the
intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the
quintet are returning, ready to mount the bandstand again.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't tell me you started a polka
            with Leo Bartha?

                         RITA
                   (shaking her head)
            No.  That's what I mean - I'm being
            fired for what I didn't do.

Sidney is amused.  Rita continues in a confidential manner
which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not-very-
convincing air of injury.

                         RITA
                   (soto voce)
            He came in last week on a very dull
            rainy night.  I know who he was,
            but I didn't let on.
                   (emphatically)
            He didn't take his eyes off me all
            night.  Listening...?

Rita has mistaken Sidney's shrewdly calculating expression
for inattention.

                         SIDNEY
            Avidly.  He was staring.

                         RITA
                   (continuing)
            Staring.  Consequently, when he
            approached me on his way out I
            wasn't surprised, but I didn't let
            on.

                         SIDNEY
                   (prompting)
            He was writing a special Sunday
            piece on...?

                         RITA
                   (nodding)
            ...cigarette girls... And naturally -

                         SIDNEY
            You were thrilled to be interviewed.
                   (she nods)
            Were you "interviewed"?

                         RITA
            In his apartment -

                         SIDNEY
            And where was his wife?

                         RITA
            I don't know - it's a big apartment.
            But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact,
            I was totally unprepared for what
            happened.

                         SIDNEY
                   (grimacing)
            We're old friends, Chickie - quit
            it!  A big columnist comes in this
            room, without his ball-and-chain
            and you make like a delicatessen
            counter!  What did you think would
            happen in his house?

                         RITA
                   (with a nod)
            But, Sidney darling, the man must
            be out of his mind - it was only
            eleven o'clock in the morning!

Despite himself, Sidney chuckles; but she is distressed.

                         RITA
            For a moment I was so taken aback
            that I said anything that popped
            into my sleepy head.  If I'm not
            mistaken, I even ordered the man
            out of his own house.

Sidney's eyes have been caught by something at the other end
of the big room.

STEVE AND SUSAN

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Susan has come back into the club
with Steve and seems to be taking leave of him.  She starts
to walk through the club on her way out.

RESUME SIDNEY AND RITA

Sidney, with half his attention on Susan and Steve, listens
to Rita's rueful protest.

                         RITA
                   (rapidly)
            He was furious and, by the time I
            could have put on a Tropical Island
            mood, I was out on the street!...
                   (dolefully)
            That night Mr. Van Cleve calls me
            into his office here.  He's got
            nothing against me, he says but he
            can't afford to antagonize
            columnists.  I told him I still
            have Sonny at military academy, but
            Van Cleve's made of ice...

Aware that Sidney is moving to leave her so that he can
catch Susan, Rita detains him with an appeal:

                         RITA
                   (tentative)
            Do you think you could do something,
            Sidney?

                         SIDNEY
                   (a quick nod)
            That's what I'm thinking, Rita.
            Maybe...

Rita is anxious to cement the offer.  Delicately, she asks:

                         RITA
            Do you still keep your key under
            the mat?

                         SIDNEY
                   (eyeing her)
            Can you be there by two-thirty?

She drops her eyes, nods.  Sidney pats her arm and is gone.
She looks after him.

SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Sidney overtakes Susan at the front entrance in time to open
the door for her.  He has now reverted to another mood in
which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to
him by Steve.  He goes out ahead of her.

BANDSTAND

The quintet are resuming their positions on the stand.
Steve lingers a moment, his guitar already in his hand while
he talks to D'Angelo.

                         STEVE
            Frank, I don't want any secrets
            from you.  I proposed to Susie
            tonight.

D'Angelo hides his feelings, asks:

                         D'ANGELO
            Did she accept?

                         STEVE
            You don't like it, do you.  I think
            she will accept, but I'm not sure.
            She may be too dependent on her
            brother.

He mounts the bandstand.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (solemnly)
            Lots of good people in this town
            are dependent on her brother...

Steve sits on the stool, quietly gives the beat to his group
and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and
lonely melody. (The Sage.)

ANOTHER ANGLE

While D'Angelo watches him, the boy continues.  CAMERA
tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and
babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation
of the quiet melancholy of the music.

OUTSIDE THE ELYSIAN ROOM

Susan is standing beside the poster which features Steve,
listening to the music from inside the club.  Sidney comes
to join her.  He is now pretending to be hurt.

                         SUSAN
            You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so
            touchy...

                         SIDNEY
                   (gruffly)
            I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I
            came to bring him a present.
                   (then)
            Wanna bite to eat?

Susan shakes her head.  She looks up as she hears the
doorman's whistle off screen.  Sidney moves forward to
escort her to the taxi.

LONGER SHOT

They cross the sidewalk and get into the cab.  It starts off
and CAMERA PANS with it.

INSIDE CAB

Susan is relaxed, content but thoughtful.  Sidney flicks her
a quick, anxious look.  Finally, gloomily:

                         SIDNEY
            Feels like a Monday night, don't
            it...?

                         SUSAN
                   (softly)
            Not to me.  Sometimes, the world
            feels like a cage.  Then someone
            comes along and opens the door...and
            it's never Monday night again...
                   (turning to Sidney)
            I wish you and Steve could like
            each other.

                         SIDNEY
                   (grimacing)
            We stick in each others craw.

                         SUSAN
            Yes, but why?

                         SIDNEY
            Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J.
            is some kind of monster.

SUSAN

Quizzically, she studies Sidney.

                         SUSAN
            Don't you?

SIDNEY

He looks up sharply, (he is momentarily startled at Susan's
insight.) Swiftly, he assumes a protesting air.

                         SIDNEY
            Susie, your brother's one of my
            best friends, and -

RESUME SUSAN

She is not totally convinced by this performance.  She
smiles skeptically.

                         SUSAN
            I know.  But someday I'd like to
            look into your clever mind and see
            what you REALLY think of him -

RESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Sidney makes a show of indignation.

                         SIDNEY
            Where do you come off to make a
            remark like that?

                         SUSAN
                   (quietly)
            Who could love a man who keeps
            jumping through burning hoops, like
            a trained poodle?

Sidney doesn't immediately answer.  Susan drops her eyes,
becoming absorbed in her own problems.  Cautiously, Sidney
lets the momentary silence continue.  Then:

                         SUSAN
                   (thoughtfully)
            Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?

                         SIDNEY
                   (glibly)
            Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He
            thinks he's very gifted - those
            boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.

Susan says nothing.  Sidney, watching her closely, probes
further:

                         SIDNEY
                   (gently)
            You feel pretty strong about this
            boy?

A pause.  Then Susan nods.  She is not looking at Sidney and
cannot see the watchfulness in his face.  Sidney prompts
again:

                         SIDNEY
            Wedding bells, you mean?

Again Susan nods.

                         SUSAN
            He wants me to go on the road with
            them.  It's an eight month tour,
            all the way to Oregon...

SIDNEY

The news has considerable impact on him.  But he hides it,
saying lightly:

                         SIDNEY
            Well, congratulations.  But don't
            go just for the ride!  Or didn't
            you accept the proposal?

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

Susan continues.

                         SUSAN
            I'm going to discuss it with J.J.
            in the morning.

A pause.  Each is concerned with private thoughts.  Susan,
relaxed, adds quietly:

                         SUSAN
                   (softly)
            It's given me a big lift to know
            that some people want me for
            myself, not just because I'm my
            brother's sister.

                         SIDNEY
            Chickie, I'll have to laugh at
            that - an attractive girl like
            you...!

Susan ignores his remark, continuing thoughtfully:

                         SUSAN
            I hope that J.J. really likes
            Steve, that it isn't an act.

                         SIDNEY
                   (with an indignant edge)
            Why should he put on an act?  Your
            brother has told PRESIDENTS where
            to go and what to do!

The taxi has pulled to a stop.  Susan sits for a moment
before she remarks.

                         SUSAN
            The act would be for my sake, not
            Steve's...

Realizing that they have come to their destination, Susan
gets up, moving out of CAMERA as she disembarks from the
taxi.  CAMERA catches a glimpse of apprehension in Sidney's
eyes.  Quickly, he decides to follow her.

EXT. BROADWAY

Susan, getting out of the taxi, moves past CAMERA.  Sidney,
following her, instructs the driver.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to cabbie)
            Wait for me.  I'll be right back.

LONGER SHOT

Sidney moves after the girl, calling: "Susie!"

SUSAN

Hearing him, Susan turns back.  Sidney walks into shot to
join her.

                         SIDNEY
                   (lightly)
            It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll
            talk to you like an uncle...

                         SUSAN
                   (smiling)
            But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.

They move through the doors.

REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney quickly corrects himself, saying earnestly:

                         SIDNEY
            No, I mean because I admire you -
            in fact, more than admire you -
            although that's neither here nor
            there.
                   (quickly skipping to
                   the important point)
            Susie, don't sell your brother
            short.  Talk this over with him, I
            mean - you'll find him a real friend.

SUSAN

Susan looks thoughtful, making no comment.

RESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Carefully (again probing) he prompts her:

                         SIDNEY
            Any message, in case I see J.J.
            later?

Susan turns away and walks out past CAMERA.  Sidney watches
her.

SUSAN

She looks back at Sidney, quietly firm.

                         SUSAN
            Yes.  Tell him for me that Steve
            Dallas is the first real man I've
            ever been in love with...

She turns away and walks through the inner door, going down
the corridor towards the elevators in background.

RESUME SIDNEY

The sincerity of the girl's manner strikes home to Sidney.
Now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain
with which he hears the statement of her feelings for
another man.  Angered, he wheels, striding out of the door
onto Broadway.

EXT. BROADWAY

Sidney returns to the cab, instructing the driver:

                         SIDNEY
            The Twenty One Club.

He climbs in and the taxi drives off down Broadway.

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA HIGH, SHOOTING WEST down 52nd Street, as Sidney's cab
pulls up, double parking in front of the 21 Club.  Sidney
maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the
entrance and the CAMERA DESCENDS to SHOOT ALONG the courtyard
towards the entrance.  We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and
his girl friend coming out of the Club.

CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT

Jimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a
girl; he is slightly tight.  As he steps through the outer
doors, Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk; he steps
to one side of the entrance way.

Sidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to
enter the Club, Weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing
him, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard.  Sidney is
instantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust
himself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon.

                         SIDNEY
            Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I
            am just going -

                         WELDON
                   (overlapping)
            Yeah.  A coincidence you should run
            into the very man you've been
            ducking all week!
                   (to the girl)
            This is my press agent, Joan.

Weldon, jibing at Sidney, plays his remarks off the girl,
who is amused; Sidney, of course, is not.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            I tried to reach you twice -

                         WELDON
                   (overlapping)
            What do you do for that hundred a
            week.  Fall out of bed?

                         SIDNEY
            Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right
            now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can
            promise you -

                         WELDON
                   (horsing)
            Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest
            this kid for larceny!

Sidney flinches, his pride touched.

                         SIDNEY
            Listen, when your band was playing
            at Roseland -

                         WELDON
                   (cutting in)
            That was two months ago.  Take your
            hand out of my pocket, thief!

The girl tries to quiet Weldon, who has gone from horsing to
loud contempt.

                         THE GIRL
            Take it easy, Jimmy dear...

                         WELDON
                   (indignantly)
            Why?  It's a dirty job, but I pay
            clean money for it, don't I?

Abruptly Sidney bursts out, giving as good as he has taken:

                         SIDNEY
            No more you don't!  What is this -
            You're showing off for her?  They're
            supposed to hear you in Korea?

                         WELDON
                   (smirking to the girl)
            He's intuitive - he knows he's
            getting fired!

                         SIDNEY
            If you're funny, James, I'm a
            pretzel!  Drop dead!

Weldon, shepherded by the girl, is already on his way across
the sidewalk.

                         WELDON
            It was nice knowing you, Sidney.
            Not cheap - but nice.  Happy
            unemployment insurance.

INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT

Sidney, entering the Club, threads his way through the
crowded foyer, coming up to CAMERA near the foot of the
staircase.  There he meets a Captain who turns to him.

                         CAPTAIN
            How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?

                         SIDNEY
                   (nodding towards the restaurant)
            Is "he" inside?

                         CAPTAIN
            But of course...

                         SIDNEY
            Alone or surrounded?

                         CAPTAIN
            A Senator, an Agent and Something -
            With - Long - Red - Hair.

Sidney moves past CAMERA, coming a couple of paces towards
the door to the restaurant.  He pauses.

REVERSE ANGLE

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Shooting through the doorway into
the restaurant, we can see the group at the table.
(Hunsecker's back is turned to us.) CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Sidney in foreground.  He decides not to go into
restaurant and turns away out of shot.

INT. LOUNGE

Sidney comes round the corner from the foyer and walks
through the lounge to the door into the alcove where the
phone booths are, CAMERA PANNING.

PHONE BOOTHS

Sidney moves briskly past the girl at the switchboard,
instructing her:

                         SIDNEY
            Honey, get me Mr. Hunsecker.

The girl reaches for a book of phone numbers, then remembers:

                         OPERATOR
            He's right inside, Mr. Falco.

                         SIDNEY
                   (from inside the booth)
            So it isn't Long Distance.

As the girl, shrugging, puts through the call, CAMERA moves
closer to Sidney in the booth.  He hears the connection
made, speaks at once.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            J.J.?  It's me --

We are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a
voice on the other end.  Though the words are not
distinguishable, it is quite clear that the speaker is not
talking to the phone.  Sidney seems to relax, as if this is
something that happens often.  He waits, studying his
manicured fingertips...

Presently Sidney hears the voice on the other end become
clearer.  It asks: "Yes?" CAMERA moves closer as Sidney says:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., it's Sidney.  Can you come
            outside for one minute?

Hunsecker's voice, filtered through the sound of the
telephone, is sharp and tiny; but the words are now very
clear.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            Can I come out?  No.

                         SIDNEY
                   (tensely)
            I have to talk to you, alone, J.J.,
            that's why.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            You had something to do for me -
            you didn't do it.

                         SIDNEY
            Can I come in for a minute?

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            No.  You're dead, son - get yourself
            buried!

There is a click as Hunsecker hangs up.  Sidney, more
slowly, also hangs up.  Brooding, he comes out of the booth.

INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - LOUNGE

Sidney comes out of the door to the phone booths, walks
through the lounge to the hallway.  He turns towards the
dining room.

INT. HALLWAY

Sidney comes to the door into the dining room, CAMERA
tracking with him.  Here he pauses, looking towards...

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Hunsecker is seated at a table
which is cleverly his habitual position.  We see him only in
semi-back view, a broad and powerful back.  He is listening
to a man who has paused at his table, stooping over Hunsecker
to whisper in his ear.  As the columnist listens, his hands
play with an omni-present pad and pencil which lie on the
dinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes, mimeographed
sheets and a telephone.  Beyond Hunsecker and the man
talking to him are the SENATOR, the AGENT, and an attractive,
if fatuous GIRL.

                         HUNSECKER
            I'll check it in the morning, Low -
            thanks.

The man leaves; Hunsecker is scribbling a note on the pad.
Meanwhile the Senator whispers something to the girl, who
giggles softly.

REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney comes across to the table, nervous but deliberate.
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker in foreground.
Sidney, without accosting him, stands a few feet from the
columnist's elbow and deliberately lights a cigarette.
Hunsecker, barely turning his head, sees him.  We have heard
of Hunsecker as a monster, but he is evidently in a mild
phase of his metabolism, for he seems gentle, sad and quiet,
as he turns his gaze casually to the Senator, totally
ignoring the young man who stands behind him.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (softly)
            Harvey, I often wish I were dead
            and wore a hearing aid...with a
            simple flick of a switch I could
            shut out the greedy murmur of
            little men...

SIDNEY

A close shot.  Sidney shows no reaction to this insult.  He
steps in closer, an Indian fixity in his face.

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., I need your ear for two
            minutes...

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting across Sidney, onto Hunsecker.  J.J. turns - but
not to Sidney.  He raises his hand in a small gesture which
summons a passing Captain, who steps into picture at Sidney's
elbow.

                         HUNSECKER
            Mac!  I don't want this man at my
            table...

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly but quietly interrupting)
            I have a message from your sister.

The Captain is already there.  But now Hunsecker's eyes have
switched to Sidney's face.  For the briefest of moments,
nothing happens.  Then Hunsecker, seeming to relax and
ignoring the Captain whom he has summoned, turns back to
casual conversation with the Senator as if nothing had
happened.

                         HUNSECKER
            Forgive me, Harvey.  We were
            interrupted before -

In foreground, Sidney turns to the Captain with a carved
smile, indicating that Hunsecker's change of topic is to be
interpreted as sanction for Sidney to remain.  The Captain,
not entirely convinced, retreats.  Sidney finds himself a
chair, places it and takes a seat which is near enough to
the table to establish his presence.  During this:

                         SENATOR
                   (who is mildly
                   surprised and faintly embarrassed)
            Err...the Supreme Court story, I
            was telling you - Justice Black.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (nodding)
            Yes, the Justice, that's right.
            But I think you had it in the column.

                         SIDNEY
                   (smoothly, casually)
            Last July, the lead item...

Sidney's interjection is quietly well-mannered.  Hunsecker
totally ignores it.  The other members of the party are a
little astonished at the interplay.  The girl, in particular,
is fascinated; she clearly admires Sidney's looks.  The
Senator, noting this, glances at Sidney, accepting the point:

                         SENATOR
                   (laughing)
            And I believe that's precisely
            where I read it, too.  You see,
            J.J., where I get my reputation for
            being the best-informed man in
            Washington.

                         HUNSECKER
            Now don't kid a kidder.

THE SENATOR, THE GIRL, AND THE AGENT

The girl looks again towards Sidney.  The Senator again sees
this, addresses Sidney pleasantly.

                         SENATOR
            I don't think we caught your name,
            young man.

REVERSE ANGLE

Group shot.  The Senator in foreground, Sidney beyond
Hunsecker in background, and the others on edge of shot.

                         SIDNEY
            Sidney Falco, sir.  And, of course,
            everyone knows and admires you,
            Senator Walker.

                         SENATOR
                   (humorously)
            Every four years I get less
            convinced of that.  This young lady
            is Miss Linda James.
                   (indicates the Girl)
            She's managed by Manny Davis.
                   (he indicates the Agent)


SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney nods pleasantly to the Girl and the Agent.

                         SIDNEY
            I know Manny Davis.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Everyone knows Manny Davis...
                   (as the phone rings
                   on the table)
            ...except MRS. Manny Davis.

Hunsecker is picking up the phone, continuing:

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes?  Go ahead, Billy - shoot...

REVERSE ANGLE

To intercut with the above.  The Senator, the Agent and the
Girl watching Hunsecker.  The Agent's reaction to Hunsecker's
remark is a sickly smile.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He repeats aloud a story which is told him over the telephone.

                         HUNSECKER
            Uh huh.  Sports cars in California
            are getting smaller and
            smaller...the other day you were
            crossing Hollywood Boulevard and
            you were hit by one...you had to go
            to the hospital and have it
            removed...
                   (coolly)
            You're not following the column: I
            had it last week.

During the speech, CAMERA eases back to include Sidney again.
At the end, Sidney looks up in the direction of the Senator.

                         SIDNEY
            Do you believe in capital
            punishment, Senator?

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

The Senator, amused, asks:

                         SENATOR
            Why?

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Sidney glances sidelong at Hunsecker.

                         SIDNEY
                   (pointing to the phone)
            A man has just been sentenced to
            death...

Hunsecker's face hardens; aware of Sidney's impertinence, he
does not design to react directly; he turns towards the Agent.

                         HUNSECKER
            Manny, what exactly are the UNSEEN
            gifts of this lovely young thing
            that you manage...?

THE AGENT AND THE GIRL

The Agent glances uneasily at the Girl beside him.

                         AGENT
            Well, she sings a little...you
            know, sings...

                         GIRL
                   (by rote)
            Manny's faith in me is simply awe-
            inspiring, Mr. Hunsecker.  Actually,
            I'm still studying, but -

RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies the Girl intently.

                         HUNSECKER
            What subject?

RESUME THE AGENT AND THE GIRL

                         GIRL
            Singing, of course...straight
            concert and -

RESUME HUNSECKER

Hunsecker's glance flicks between the Girl and the Senator.

                         HUNSECKER
            Why "of course"?  It might, for
            instance, be politics...

As the Girl betrays herself with a nervous glance at the
Senator beside her, CAMERA eases back to include him.  The
Senator is unruffled; gravely, he lights a cigar.  The Girl
laughs.

                         GIRL
            Me?  I mean "I"?  Are you kidding,
            Mr. Hunsecker?  With my Jersey City
            brains?

RESUME HUNSECKER

Again his glance links the Girl and the Senator.

                         HUNSECKER
            The brains may be Jersey City, but
            the clothes are Trainor-Norell.

THE SENATOR, THE AGENT AND THE GIRL

The Girl and the Agent are both nervously uneasy.  The
Senator closely examines the tip of his cigar and, with
deliberation, turns towards Sidney.

                         SENATOR
            Are you an actor, Mr. Falco?

                         GIRL
                   (supporting the
                   change of subject)
            That's what I was thinking.  Are
            you, Mr. Falco?

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Hunsecker, for the first time, half-turns in Sidney's
direction, amused.

                         HUNSECKER
            How did you guess it, Miss James?

RESUME THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

They all look at Sidney.

                         GIRL
            He's so pretty, that's how.

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney bitterly resents the adjective, but contrives to hide
the fact; he smiles, gracefully accepting the compliment.
Hunsecker (who knows what Sidney feels) is pleased; he turns
towards Sidney expansively.

                         HUNSECKER
            Mr. Falco, let it be said at once,
            is a man of FORTY faces, not one,
            none too pretty and ALL deceptive.
            See that grin?  It's the charming
            street urchin's face.  It's part of
            his "helpless" act - he throws
            himself on your mercy.  I skip the
            pleading nervous bit that sometimes
            blends over into bluster.  The
            moist grateful eye is a favorite
            face with him - it frequently ties
            in with the act of boyish candor:
            he's talking straight from the
            heart, get it?  He's got about
            half-a-dozen faces for the ladies,
            but the real cut one to me is the
            quick dependable chap - nothing he
            won't do for you in a pinch.  At
            least, so he says!  Tonight Mr.
            Falco, whom I did not invite to sit
            at this table, is about to show in
            his last and most pitiful role:
            pale face with tongue hanging out.
            In brief, gentlemen and Jersey
            Lilly, the boy sitting with us is a
            hungry press agent and fully up to
            all the tricks of his very slimy
            trade!

Hunsecker has started his speech lightly, but it has built
up to enough cold contempt and feeling to embarrass and
intimidate the others at the table.  In conclusion,
Hunsecker, his eyes on Sidney, picks up a cigarette and
waits expectantly...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Match me, Sidney...

                         SIDNEY
                   (coolly)
            Not just this minute, J.J....

Amused, Hunsecker lights his own cigarette, turns towards a
man who comes up to the table.

HUNSECKER

A single close up, to intercut with the above.

SIDNEY

A matching single; Sidney's reaction to Hunsecker and to the
others at the table.

THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

To intercut with the above; their reactions of embarrassment.

GROUP SHOT

A florid MAN comes up to the table, obviously anxious to
catch Hunsecker's attention.  Hunsecker, in the act of
lighting, his own cigarette, scarcely looks at the man as he
dismisses him:

                         HUNSECKER
            I know - that loafer of yours opens
            at the Latin Quarter next week.
                   (more sharply)
            Say goodbye, Lester!

The florid man retreats.  To cover the embarrassment, the
Senator makes a sally in Sidney's direction.

                         SENATOR
            May I ask a naive question, Mr.
            Falco?  Exactly how does a press
            agent work...?

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney doesn't answer.

                         HUNSECKER
            Why don't you answer the man,
            Sidalee?  He's trying to take you
            off the hook.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to the Senator)
            You just had a good example of it.
            A press agent eats a columnists
            dirt and is expected to call it
            manna.

RESUME THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

                         GIRL
            What's manna?

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker glances spitefully at the Girl.

                         HUNSECKER
            Heaven dust.

RESUME THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

The Senator continues to Sidney:

                         SENATOR
            But don't you help columnists by
            furnishing them with items?

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney leans forward, indicating to the Senator some of the
items of paper that litter the table in front of Hunsecker;
these are both handwritten notes and mimeograph sheets,
scraps of assorted items from professional and amateur
agents who supply the columnist.  Sidney fingers some of them.

                         SIDNEY
            Sure, columnists can't get along
            without us.  Only our good and
            great friend, J.J., forgets to
            mention that.  We furnish him with
            items -

Sidney lifts a mimeographed sheet, as an example.

                         HUNSECKER
            What, some cheap, gruesome gags?

                         SIDNEY
                   (to Hunsecker now)
            You print them, don't you?

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes, with your clients' names
            attached.  That's the only reason
            those poor slobs pay you - to see
            their names in my column all over
            the world!  Now, as I make it out,
            you're doing ME a favor!

                         SIDNEY
            I didn't say that, J.J.

                         HUNSECKER
            The day that I can't get along
            without press agents' handouts,
            I'll close up shop, lock, stock and
            barrel and move to Alaska.

THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

The Agent makes the mistake of trying to agree with Hunsecker.

                         AGENT
                   (nodding)
            Sweep out my igloo, here I come.

CAMERA pulls back as Hunsecker leans forward across the
table.  He vents upon the unfortunate Agent some of the
annoyance prompted by Sidney's impertinence.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to the Agent)
            Look, Manny, you rode in here on
            the Senator's shirt tails, so shut
            your mouth!

The Senator doesn't like this treatment of others and his
manner and face show it.

                         SENATOR
                   (slowly)
            Now, come, J.J., that's a little
            too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game
            for you tonight.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (not as harsh, but -)
            This man is not for you, Harvey,
            and you shouldn't be seen with him
            in public.  Because that's another
            part of a press agents life - he
            digs up scandal among prominent men
            and shovels it thin among the
            columnists who give him space.

SENATOR

He finds Hunsecker's manner disturbing, but addresses him
frontally.

                         SENATOR
            There is some allusion here that
            escapes me...

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
                   (an edge of threat)
            We're friends, Harvey - we go as
            far back as when you were a fresh
            kid Congressman, don't we?

RESUME SENATOR

                         SENATOR
            Why does everything you say sound
            like a threat?

RESUME HUNSECKER

He leans back, speaking more quietly, enjoying himself.

                         HUNSECKER
            Maybe it's a mannerism - because I
            don't threaten friends, Harvey.
            But why furnish your enemies with
            ammunition?  You're a family man.
            Someday, with God willing, you may
            wanna be President.  Now here you
            are, Harvey, out in the open where
            any hep person knows that this one...

AGENT

Hunsecker leans into shot pointing directly at the Agent.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...is toting THAT one...

Hunsecker points to the Girl and the CAMERA makes a slight
crab movement to include the Girl as Hunsecker points in
turn to her.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...around for you...

Another CAMERA movement.  Now Hunsecker is directly
challenging the Senator.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He smiles disarmingly.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...Are we kids or what?...

Hunsecker rises.

GROUP SHOT

As Hunsecker stands up, Sidney follows suit.  The Agent,
very nervous, gets to his feet and the Girl does likewise.
The Senator, whose face is sober, also rises from the table.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to the Senator, affably)
            Next time you come up, you might
            join me at my TV show.

With Sidney making way for him, Hunsecker walks round the
end of the table to the Senator.  The Senator faces Hunsecker
solemnly.

                         SENATOR
                   (quietly and cautiously)
            Thank you, J.J., for what I consider
            sound advice.

Hunsecker matches the Senator's solemnity.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (deadpan)
            Go, Thou, and sin no more.

Hunsecker moves out of shot.  Sidney murmurs a "pleased to
meet you" to the Senator; then he follows Hunsecker.  The
Senator remains looking after Hunsecker.  Behind him, the
Agent and the Girl, watch him apprehensively.  The Senator,
his face now showing the traces of guilt which he did not
reveal to Hunsecker, seems unwilling to turn back to face
them.

ON THE WAY TO THE FOYER

Hunsecker and Sidney.  Hunsecker addresses the Captain on
his way out of the restaurant.

                         HUNSECKER
            Mac, don't let the Senator pay that
            check...

                         CAPTAIN
            I'll take care of it, Mr. Hunsecker.

CAMERA tracks with Hunsecker and Sidney as they move out
towards the hat check stand.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (murmuring)
            President!  My big toe would make a
            better President!

By now they are at the coatroom, Hunsecker smiling.

                         ATTENDANT
            Mr. Hunsecker's coat, Joe.

                         HUNSECKER
            Find me a good one, Joe.

He accepts the proferred coat as he moves past CAMERA.

LONGER SHOT - NIGHT

The Doorman on the sidewalk has noticed Hunsecker, almost
before the columnist has appeared.  The Doorman wheels,
snapping his fingers and signaling towards the car park
attendant, who can be seen at some distance in the background
under the lights of the Kinney Car Park.  The attendant is
seen to react with alacrity, running into the Park.

HUNSECKER

Putting on his overcoat, he addresses another of the Captains
who has escorted him out of the Club.

                         HUNSECKER
            Dan, anyone calls, tell 'em I'll be
            at the Morocco, maybe the Embers.

                         DAN
            Very good, Mr. Hunsecker.

Sidney catches up with Hunsecker as he moves out onto the
sidewalk.

                         HUNSECKER
            Where's your coat, Sidalee?  Saving
            tips?

Sidney thinks of an impertinent reply, decides not to be
drawn and says nothing.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Sidney)
            My curiosity is killing me; what
            are you so rambunctious about
            tonight?

Sidney again does not answer; this time he points across the
street...

                         SIDNEY
            There's your fat friend.

LONGER SHOT - POLICE CAR - NIGHT

The car is framed in foreground; We can read the sign POLICE
attached to the visor.  Two men in plain-clothes, detectives,
are in the front seats.  The man nearest is HARRY KELLO.
Wanting to look like a prosperous business man, Kello looks
soft, fat, mild and well-barbered; but he is dangerous; he
knows it and enjoys it.  With "big shots" he is playful and
kidding, always says just enough, not too much.  He is very
relaxed, and mild in manner, but underneath there is not
only an animal energy, but a feral pressing at you.  His
voice is on the hoarse side.  He measures situations
automatically and instantly.

The police radio is chattering.  Also in evidence is the
telephone, the radio link with headquarters.  The detective
at the wheel nudges Kello, pointing across the street.
Kello gets out of the car and moves to meet the columnist.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (as he approaches)
            Hello, Harry.

                         KELLO
                   (cheerfully)
            Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?

Sidney follows a couple of paces behind Hunsecker; he is in
no hurry to meet the detective, whom he clearly dislikes.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (turning to Sidney)
            You see, Sidalee, that shows that
            Lt. Kello likes your people.

REVERSE ON KELLO

Kello offers his hand to Hunsecker.

                         KELLO
            It's my Brooklyn background, J.J.
            I'm good on Yiddish, too.

Hunsecker accepting the handshake, winces with pretended
pain at what is clearly an over-enthusiastic grip.

                         HUNSECKER
            Harry, am I supposed to say "uncle"?

Kello laughs, releases the grip; Hunsecker strolls past him
stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on
the radio.

                         HUNSECKER
            Anything fit to print, tonight?
                   (to the policeman in
                   the car)
            Hello, Phil.  How're the kids.

The detective inside the car answers, respectfully.

                         PHIL
            Fine, Mr. Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER
            Any news fit to print tonight?

                         KELLO
                   (joining Hunsecker)
            I just checked "downtown".  Quiet
            everywhere tonight.

                         HUNSECKER
            Incidentally, what happened to that
            doll? - You gave me the item last
            night.  Still alive?

                         KELLO
            Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging
            on.  But they still don't know if
            she was pushed.

                         HUNSECKER
            She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?
                   (to the policeman in
                   the car)
            Check it for me, Phil...it's a real
            heart throb.

While Phil lifts the radio phone, calling headquarters,
Hunsecker turns back to Kello and Sidney.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mischievously, Hunsecker nods at Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Kello)
            Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle
            him - he's been a bad boy tonight.
            He called you my fat friend.

                         KELLO
                   (mildly)
            I don't believe it.

Instantly aware that J.J. is toying with Sidney, Kello
offers his large hand to Sidney, who refuses it.

                         SIDNEY
            I know...I know you're the strongest
            cop in town.

                         KELLO
                   (with a laugh)
            I call him the boy with the ice
            cream face!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (laughing)
            Say, that's good - it's nice - in
            fact, it's APT, Harry!

                         KELLO
                   (modestly)
            Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things
            together.

                         HUNSECKER
            I remember ONCE when you didn't
            quite "put things together".  Boy!
            Was the Mayor mad!

The memory of something unpleasant clouds Kello's face.

                         KELLO
            Citizens committees!  I didn't mean
            to hit the boy that hard.  Yeah,
            that's when a feller needed a
            friend and I won't forget his
            initials, J.J.

The policeman in the car sticks his head out of the window.

                         PHIL
                   (to Hunsecker)
            She died twenty minutes ago, Mr.
            Hunsecker.  They're still
            investigating.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (shaking his head
                   with total dismissal)
            That's show business.  Thanks, Phil.
                   (to Kello)
            See you.

ANOTHER ANGLE - 52ND STREET - NIGHT

Kello gets into the police car.

                         KELLO
                   (as he does so)
            Hasta La Vista, J.J.  Hasta Luego.

ANOTHER ANGLE - 52ND ST. - NIGHT

The car moves off eastward.  Sidney and Hunsecker walk
westward.  Sidney, falling into step with Hunsecker, glances
back at the departing police car.

                         SIDNEY
            Spahish...that must show he likes
            "spigs", too.

                         HUNSECKER
            I like Harry, but I can't deny he
            sweats a little.

CAMERA now SHOOTS down 52nd Street.  Hunsecker, back to
CAMERA, studies the evening, hearing the sound of a screech
of female laughter from one of the groups in the distance.
A drunk is being thrown out of one of the strip tease joints.

                         HUNSECKER
            I love this dirty town.

Amused, Hunsecker turns back; he signals across the street
to the car park, indicating that the big black Lincoln
Continental should follow as he strolls with Sidney.

HUNSECKER.  SIDNEY FOLLOWING.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (after a pause)
            Conjugate me a verb, Sidney.  For
            instance, TO PROMISE!

CAMERA TRACKS with them in a CLOSE TWO SHOT.  Sidney is
alert now.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            You told me you'd break up that
            romance - when?

                         SIDNEY
                   (hesitantly)
            You want something done, J.J., but
            I doubt if you yourself know what's
            involved.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (soft and sardonic)
            I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.

                         SIDNEY
                   (carefully)
            Why not break it up yourself?  You
            could do it in two minutes flat.

Hunsecker pauses, halts.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (harshly)
            At this late date you need
            explanations...?  Susie's all I
            got - now that she's growing up, I
            want my relationship with her to
            stay at least at par!  I don't
            intend to antagonize her if I don't
            have to.
                   (starting to walk again)
            Now, be warned, son - I'll have to
            blitz you...

Sidney follows quickly.

                         SIDNEY
            Frankly, J.J., I don't think you
            got the cards to blitz me.

                         HUNSECKER
            I don't?

                         SIDNEY
            Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
            don't think so...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (turning to eye him)
            I'll listen one more minute.

Sidney steps in front of Hunsecker, blocking his way for a
moment.

                         SIDNEY
                   (very rapidly)
            About a year ago, you asked me to
            do a favor.  It was a thing - well,
            I never did a thing that dirty in
            all my life.

Hunsecker, totally disinterested in Sidney's problems of
conscience, signals to his car again, walks past Sidney, who
continues rapidly:

                         SIDNEY
            Awright, that brings us up to five
            weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty
            little problem here." Did I say no?
            I'm frank to admit - it don't jell
            as fast as we like... But all of a
            sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE
            NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of
            this date, am I frozen out of the
            column...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (scornfully)
            Are you finished?

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE
            THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on
            matinee days - otherwise he's got a
            head.  And Susan, like you said,
            she's growing up.  Two heads.
            What I mean, we got a slippery,
            dangerous problem here!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (incisively)
            Not "we", Sidney, you!

                         SIDNEY
                   (gamely)
            Correct me if I'm wrong - WE!
            Because when I'm out on this very
            slippery limb for you, you have to
            know what's involved.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (sardonically)
            Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my
            left hand for thirty years!

Sidney quickly moves into J.J.'s path, desperate to hold his
attention.

                         SIDNEY
            I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me
            wrong - in for a penny, in for a
            pound.  I'll see it through, but
            stop beating me around the head.
            Let me make a living!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (his mouth tight and mean)
            What you promised - do it!  Don't
            finagle around.  It's later than
            you think.

Hunsecker walks past Sidney, now making for the car at which
the attendant still waits.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as Hunsecker passes him)
            Excuse it, but it's later than you
            think.  That boy proposed tonight.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker is HIT: he stops in his stride; he pauses and he
turns slowly to look at Sidney.  Lowering, he hesitates,
mind clicking...

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie told you that...?

REVERSE ANGLE - FAVORING SIDNEY

Sidney, his eyes bright, nods.  Hunsecker studies Sidney,
then:

                         HUNSECKER
            No wonder you've been so 'feisty'
            tonight.

A pause.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Can you deliver?

Sidney nods.

                         SIDNEY
            Uh huh.

                         HUNSECKER
            When?

                         SIDNEY
            Tonight.  Before you go to bed.
            The cat is in the bag and the bag
            is in the river.

HUNSECKER

Expressionless, he examines Sidney.  Then he walks off
toward the car.  He tips the attendant, who thanks him, but
instead of getting into the back of the car, he makes a
small authoritative gesture to Nikko (double) to move over
so that Hunsecker himself may drive.  While Nikko does so,
Hunsecker turns back to Sidney, whom the CAMERA now includes.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Don't be a two time loser, Sidalee.
            The sentence could be severe...

SIDNEY

He is satisfied.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker gets into the driver's seat beside Nikko, the
Japanese houseboy.  CAMERA is CLOSE on Hunsecker who does
not look back but is clearly aware of the position of Sidney
as he puts the car into gear, revving the engine...

SIDNEY - NIGHT

The big car accelerates with impressive power.  In doing so,
it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in Sidney's
direction.  He leaps out of the way, too late.  CAMERA MOVES
closer to him as, with anger and ignominy he inspects his
precious clothing for damage.  But, as he looks after the
car, his face hardens into grim humor; he senses that this
petty gesture from Hunsecker is an indication of his
vulnerability, not his strength.  As, dusting his coat,
Sidney walks away, CAMERA RISES, watching his jaunty figure
cross the street in the direction of 51st Street.

                                      QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TOOTS SHOR'S RESTAURANT

A LONG SHOT looking over the round bar towards the entrance.
Sidney comes in through the revolving doors and comes toward
CAMERA.  His eyes search among the crowd.

CLOSER ANGLE

REVERSE ANGLE.  A CAPTAIN approaches Sidney.

                         CAPTAIN
            Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?

                         SIDNEY
                   (shaking his head)
            Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha
            been in?

                         CAPTAIN
            Yeah, having supper with the Mrs.
            She's over there.

The Captain nods towards a booth on the other side of the
bar where Mrs. Bartha is sitting alone.  Seeing that Bartha
is not with her, the Captain looks around the bar...

                         CAPTAIN
            He's somewhere...

                         SIDNEY
                   (interrupting)
            Thanks, I see him...

Sidney is looking back towards the entrance hall, where...

BARTHA

Bartha comes forward (from the Men's Room) passing the
Captain and Sidney.  Sidney moves to intercept him.

                         SIDNEY
            Hello, Leo.  How goes that Sunday
            piece on cigarette girls?

ANOTHER ANGLE

A CLOSE SHOT on Bartha as he turns towards Sidney, stopping.

                         BARTHA
                   (cautiously)
            Who told you about it?

SIDNEY

Sidney smiles at Bartha, but the threat is clear.

                         SIDNEY
            The cigarettes girl...Rita.  And
            she took out all her hairpins, too.

RESUME BARTHA

He throws a quick glance at his wife in the booth in
background.  CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney, who has noted the
look, moves closer to Bartha.

                         SIDNEY
            I never had the pleasure of meeting
            your wife.  You know what I wonder,
            Leo?  Could you use a hot little
            item for tomorrow's column?

Sidney is pulling out of his pocket a pad on which to
scribble the item.  But Bartha faces him squarely, speaking
sotto voce but with emphasis:

                         BARTHA
            What is this, blackmail?  Beat it!

Bartha turns on his heel and turns to walk towards his wife
beyond.

SIDNEY

Sidney's face tightens.  After a pause, he makes a decision
and walks towards the booth.

BARTHA AND HIS WIFE

Bartha's wife is reading a tabloid and sipping champagne
while her husband resumes eating a sandwich.  These two are
antagonists in a long war.  Sidney comes up to the table,
repeats:

                         SIDNEY
            Leo, I've never had the pleasure of
            meeting your wife...

Bartha looks up.  What can he do?  Begrudgingly:

                         BARTHA
            Loretta...Sidney Falco...

                         WIFE
                   (chatty)
            How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you
            know anything about horses, sit a
            minute.  Help yourself to a glass
            of this N.Y. State champagne -
            that's what my husband buys me.

Mrs. Bartha pushes the champagne bottle in Sidney's direction
as Sidney sits pleasantly; Bartha concentrates on his
sandwich.

                         SIDNEY
            All the imported wines aren't what
            they're cracked up to be.

                         WIFE
            Whose side are you on, Mr. Falco,
            his or mine?

                         SIDNEY
            Frankly, Mrs. Bartha, I'm a neutral
            observer for the United Nations.

WIFE

Mrs. Bartha laughs, enjoying his deftness; then:

                         WIFE
            What's your first name?

                         SIDNEY
                   (over scene)
            Sidney.

Mrs. Bartha turns to concentrate on the names in the racing
column of the tabloid.

                         WIFE
                   (searching the column)
            No horse running tomorrow by that
            name...

BARTHA, WIFE AND SIDNEY

An ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney.  Bartha glowers at his
wife, resenting the fact that she has permitted Sidney to
join them.

                         BARTHA
            You ought to stop this nonsense,
            Loretta, these two dollar bets.

                         WIFE
                   (cheerfully)
            It's compensation, Leo, for the
            marginal life we lead.
                   (to Sidney)
            Sidney, did you hear the story
            about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?

                         BARTHA
                   (sharply interrupting)
            That's right!  Tell him, so I can
            read it in Hunsecker's column first!

                         WIFE
                   (to Sidney, brightly)
            Oh, are you a spy for the other side?

                         SIDNEY
            No, I actually sat down to give Leo
            an item.

produces his pad again, begins to write on it.

                         WIFE
            Leo, he wants to give you an item -
            don't be sullen.

Bartha notes Sidney's writing.

                         BARTHA
                   (to his wife)
            Will you mind your own business!

                         WIFE
                   (calmly)
            Hitler!

She returns to her paper, ignoring them, Sidney finishes
scribbling the item.

                         SIDNEY
            Just in case you'd like to print
            it, Leo.  It's a blind - no names
            mentioned.  But for your private
            information, the guy's name is
            Dallas.

He pushes the item to Bartha, who reads it, briefly.
Meanwhile:

                         WIFE
                   (concentrating on the tabloid)
            There isn't a single name here that
            gives off vibrations...

Bartha pushes the item back towards Sidney.  Sidney glances
quickly at Bartha's stony face then, significantly, turns
towards his wife.

                         SIDNEY
            Anything there with a name like
            "cigarette girl"?

Bartha raises his head, looks squarely at Sidney with
contempt and anger.  His wife is unaware of this reaction.
Still looking at the paper, she murmurs:

                         WIFE
            MMmmmm..."cigarette girl"... No, no
            horse with a name like that...

Sidney pushes the item back towards Bartha.

WIFE

Mrs. Bartha's attention is attracted by Sidney's gesture.
She looks up, made aware of this strange by-play.

BARTHA AND SIDNEY

A CLOSE TWO SHOT.  Sidney waits; Bartha is white-lipped, but
pushes the item back again:

                         BARTHA
            I don't print blind items.

RESUME WIFE

She looks from Sidney to her husband and back.

                         WIFE
            What is this, chess or checkers...?

RESUME BARTHA, MRS. BARTHA AND SIDNEY

The THREE SHOT favoring Bartha and Sidney.  Both Sidney and
Bartha are now aware of Mrs. Bartha's curiosity.

                         SIDNEY
                   (pointedly)
            Neither does Hunsecker.
                   (fractional pause)
            He likes to use the real names...

A moment of chill silence.  Then Bartha gets to his feet,
signals for a waiter.  As Sidney rises also:

                         WIFE
            Where are we running?  What am I
            missing here?

                         BARTHA
            Waiter, the check.
                   (to wife)
            This man is trying to hold a gun to
            my head!

                         WIFE
                   (abruptly)
            That's the horse!  Shotgun -
            Shotgun in the fifth!

She quickly studies her newspaper again.  As quickly, Bartha
leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands.  In
doing so, he upsets the glass of champagne, which contains
only a few drops.

SIDNEY AND BARTHA

Bartha turns challengingly to Sidney.

                         BARTHA
                   (sternly)
            What do you want to tell my wife,
            Sidney...?

WIFE

She is brushing her lap with her napkin.

                         WIFE
                   (indignantly)
            He wants to tell me that you poured
            champagne all over my lap.

RESUME BARTHA AND SIDNEY

Bartha ignores her, again challenges Sidney.

                         BARTHA
            Go on, tell her, I'm waiting!

                         SIDNEY
                   (flustered)
            What are you talking about?  Are
            you nuts or what?

The Waiter arrives in picture beside them, puts the check on
the table and goes.  Bartha picks it up.

RESUME WIFE

Still mopping her dress with her napkin, she waits for her
husband to speak.

BARTHA

He glances unhappily at his wife.

                         BARTHA
            Lorry, I can't let this man
            blackmail me...

MRS. BARTHA, BARTHA AND SIDNEY

A THREE SHOT favoring Mrs. Bartha, her husband and Sidney in
foreground.

                         WIFE
            Blackmail...?

Sidney decides to retreat.  He turns, starts to go.  But
Bartha blocks his way, holding Sidney and explaining to the
Wife.

                         BARTHA
            He wants me to print a dirty smear
            item for keeping his mouth shut

A momentarily pause.  Then:

                         WIFE
            About what?

RESUME BARTHA

He is uneasy, ashamed of himself.

                         BARTHA
            Foolishly, Lorry, and I hope you'll
            understand... this cigarette
            girl...I was kidding around with
            her...this girl, I mean...I was
            kidding around and she took it
            seriously.  It was a case of bad
            judgment, Lorry, bad taste...and
            I'm just sorry, Lorry, that's all...

RESUME WIFE

She says nothing.

RESUME BARTHA, SIDNEY AND MRS. BARTHA

The ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney, Mrs. Bartha in
foreground.  Bartha now turns on Sidney.

                         BARTHA
            Your friend Hunsecker - you can
            tell him for me - he's a disgrace
            to his profession.  Never mind my
            bilious private life - I print a
            decent, responsible column - that's
            the way it stays!  Your man -
            there's nothing he won't print if
            it satisfies his vanity or his
            spite!  He'll use any spice to
            pepper up his daily garbage!  Tell
            him I said so and that, like
            yourself, he's got the morals of a
            guinea pig and the scruples of a
            gangster!

Sidney tries to brazen it out, sneering:

                         SIDNEY
            What do I do now?  Whistle "The
            Stars and Stripes Forever?"

Mrs. Bartha slides along the seat, reaching for her fur.

MRS. BARTHA

CAMERA PULLS BACK with her as she collects her belongings,
slides out between the tables and comes forward, passing
Sidney to her husband.

                         WIFE
                   (lightly)
            What you do now, Mr. Falco, is crow
            like a hen - you have just laid an
            egg.

She presents her fur to her husband, and turns her back,
inviting him to put it around her shoulders.

BARTHA AND WIFE

ANOTHER ANGLE, favoring Bartha.  He has not fully understood
the significance of his wife's gesture.  He studies her.
She confirms his hopes as she adds:

                         WIFE
            Leo, this is one of the cleanest
            things I've seen you do in years...

With the fur around her shoulders, she turns and takes her
husband's arm with some pride.  They walk away.  CAMERA
ERASES BACK to include Sidney.  He is angry at himself -
more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any
sense of shame at the attempt.

OTIS ELWELL

A MEDIUM LONG SHOT.  At a booth on the other side of the bar
sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes.
He has been watching the altercation with keen interest and
satisfaction.  Elwell gives some instructions to a waiter
who is serving him with drinks, pointing towards Sidney.

SIDNEY

Sidney's face shows a burning resentment.  He glances about
him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been
observed.  As he moves away, the waiter walks into shot,
addressing him.

WAITER

A waiter approaches Sidney.  He has a message.

                         WAITER
            Otis Elwell wants to see you, Sidney.

The waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar.
Sidney, his humiliation and rage still burning, looks off
towards...

OTIS ELWELL

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Elwell beckons.

SIDNEY

He comes round the circular bar.  He shows no eagerness to
join Elwell, but approaches the table.  Elwell makes a
gesture, inviting Sidney to sit.  Sidney doesn't accept it.

                         ELWELL
                   (pleasantly)
            I see Bartha gave you cold tongue
            for supper.
                   (as Sidney starts to leave)
            Hey, wait a minute!

                         SIDNEY
                   (hesitating)
            I'm late for a date with a dame.

Then, returning, he leans over the table addressing Elwell
with quiet anger.

                         SIDNEY
            Otis, if you're trying to blow this
            brawl into an item for your column -
            forget it!

REVERSE ANGLE

Across Sidney and Elwell.  Elwell is quietly enjoying
Sidney's display of hurt dignity.

                         ELWELL
                   (affably)
            How is dear old J.J. by the way?

                         SIDNEY
                   (his anger relapsing)
            Call him up and ask - he might drop
            dead with shock.

                         ELWELL
                   (lightly)
            If it were that easy, you wouldn't
            find an empty phone booth for the
            next two hours...

SIDNEY

A CLOSE SHOT.  While Elwell continues, he is not looking at
Sidney.  Elwell's expression of dislike of Hunsecker is not
overemphatic; but Sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is
very real - and this gives him a new idea.

                         ELWELL
                   (continuing over scene)
            ...Talk of a wake! - they'd club
            each other to cater the affair for
            free!

RESUME ELWELL AND SIDNEY

Elwell looks up at Sidney as he continues.

                         ELWELL
                   (happily)
            By the way, did I hear something
            about J.J. giving you the flit gun
            treatment - he shut you out of the
            column.
                   (amused)
            Why?

REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment (in
order to exploit Elwell's dislike of Hunsecker).

                         SIDNEY
            You don't know that lunatic yet?
            Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the
            gag - when you got him for a
            friend, you don't need an enemy!
                   (a pause, then:)
            That's what the fight with Bartha
            was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker
            froze me out.  So I'm eating humble
            pie this month - please print me an
            item."

                         ELWELL
                   (pleased)
            And, instead, he printed his heel
            in your face?

                         SIDNEY
                   (morose)
            I see you're full of human
            feelings...

ELWELL

He has lost interest in Sidney.

                         ELWELL
                   (with a shrug)
            Like most of the human race,
            Sidney, I'm bored.  I'd go a mile
            for a chuckle...

Elwell's voice fades: his attention has been caught by...

REVERSE ANGLE

...three people are passing the table, squeezing their way
past; a man with two very fetching young women.  Elwell's
eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed.

                         SIDNEY
                   (noting Elwell's preoccupation)
            ...and two miles for a pretty
            girl...?

ELWELL

He is unembarrassed at Sidney's all-too-accurate estimate.

                         ELWELL
                   (lightly)
            Three...even four...

Elwell turns back towards the papers on his table, a zippered
document case and some publications among which a columnist
might search for scandal; among these is a magazine of
semipornographic nature.

                         ELWELL
                   (continuing, casually)
            Then you're really washed up with
            Hunsecker...?

REVERSE ANGLE

The nature of Elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on
Sidney.  With his eyes glancing at the magazine, Sidney now
accepts the original offer to sit down.  He produces the
slip of paper that Bartha rejected, offering it as
illustration.

                         SIDNEY
            This is how much I'm washed with
            J.J....

As Elwell reads, Sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny -
apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazine
cover.

                         SIDNEY
            Look, Otis, I make no brief for my
            bilious private life, but he's got
            the morals of a guinea pig and the
            scruples of a gangster.

Elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item.

                         ELWELL
                   (dryly)
            A fine, fat dirty item.
                   (offering it back to Sidney)
            Who's it about?

But Sidney doesn't take the paper back; he explains:

                         SIDNEY
            A kid named Dallas, who runs a
            dinky jazz quintet.
                   (he leans closer)
            He keeps company with J.J.'s
            screwball sister...

ELWELL

This does get a reaction, a flicker of genuine interest.
Elwell reads the item for a second time.

SIDNEY AND ELWELL

Watching Elwell read, Sidney encourages:

                         SIDNEY
            It's a real goody if, like me, you
            wanna clobber J.J.!

Now Elwell lays the item down in front of him.  Clearly, he
is considering it.  Sidney prompts again.

                         SIDNEY
            He's got his TV tomorrow.  He'd
            read it just before rehearsals.

Elwell nods.  But he is still reluctant.

                         ELWELL
                   (cautiously)
            Mmm.  Trouble is I can't think of
            any good reason why I should print
            anything you give me.  I can't even
            think of a bad reason.

SIDNEY

Sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more.  He fingers
it in a preoccupied but significant way.

                         SIDNEY
                   (gently)
            Suppose I introduce you to a lovely
            reason, Otis.  One that's good and
            bad...and available?

ELWELL

His eyes go from the magazine to Sidney; he gets the point
alright.

                         ELWELL
            I'm not an unreasonable man...

Elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more.

SIDNEY AND ELWELL

In picking it up, Elwell clearly implies his readiness to
accept the item - on conditions.  Sidney, in his turn, gets
this point.  He turns towards the passing waiter.

                         SIDNEY
            Waiter!  The check.

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rita is in the bedroom.  She appears to have some familiarity
to the premises... She hears the doorbell.  She makes swift
adjustment to her appearance and takes a swift gulp of a
drink as she carries it through to answer the door.

SIDNEY'S OFFICE

The outer room is lit only by one of the lamps on the desk.
Rita crosses and goes to the door.  Sidney's shadow can be
seen through the frosted glass.  At the door, Rita opens it
slowly and with a seductive manner.

                         RITA
                   (coyly)
            Hi!

Sidney steps into the room.  Rita begins to close the door
prior to stepping into his embrace.  Sidney puts one arm
about her.  But now she reacts to...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Otis Elwell stands on the landing outside.  In most
gentlemanly fashion, he takes off his hat.

RITA

This new arrival gets a dismal reaction from the girl.

                         SIDNEY
                   (unembarrassed)
            Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.

                         RITA
                   (with no welcome whatsoever)
            Hello.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Elwell is not unaware of his cool reception.  He glances at
Sidney as he comes into the room.  But his manner is suave.

                         ELWELL
            Friends call me Otis - sometimes
            Tricky Otis.

                         SIDNEY
            Otis was outraged when I told him
            Van Cleve was going to fire you.
            Tell him not to pay any attention
            to anything you-know-who says about
            you-know-what.
                   (to Otis)
            Right, Otis?

                         ELWELL
            Right!

Elwell sits down on the sette, stretches his limbs, smiles
at the girl.  Rita still says nothing.  Sidney mistakes her
attitude for acquiescence.  He swallows his drink, sets it
down.

                         SIDNEY
            I thought you two could talk the
            whole thing over till I got back.

Rita looks at him sharply.

                         RITA
            Back?

                         SIDNEY
            One of those business meetings,
            honey - always coming up in the
            middle of the night.

He grins at Rita.  She doesn't respond.  Turning, she goes
swiftly through the door into the bedroom.

                         RITA
                   (sharply)
            Hold on.  You can drop me off on
            your way...

Emphasizing the asperity in her voice, she closes the door
behind her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Elwell looks at Sidney; Sidney looks at Elwell.  Elwell gets
up slowly from the settee.

                         ELWELL
                   (amused by acid)
            Consternation reigns...

Sidney is uncomfortable, not sure how Elwell is taking the
rejection.  Elwell glances at his wristwatch, lays down his
drink.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            Now, Otis...

Elwell shrugs, remarks pleasantly but with significance:

                         ELWELL
            I hate J.J. -- but not that much at
            this moment...

                         SIDNEY
            Give me a chance --

He goes into the bedroom, closing the door after him.

INT. BEDROOM

Rita is in a flurry of indignation.  Sitting on the bed, she
is fastening one high-heeled shoe.  Sidney stands glaring at
her.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't you know who that man is?

                         RITA
                   (bitingly)
            Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.

                         SIDNEY
                   (nodding with emphasis)
            Yeah!

                         RITA
                   (aggressively)
            And he's a perfect stranger to me.

                         SIDNEY
                   (explosively)
            So take five minutes!  Get
            acquainted!  He's an important
            man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!

Rita, who one shoe on, has begun to search for the other.

                         RITA
            What do you want all of a sudden -
            Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other
            shoe?

                         SIDNEY
            What kind of an act is this?

Rita jumps to her feet.  Her righteous indignation is
handicapped by the lop-sided stance caused by the lack of
one shoe.

                         RITA
            Don't you think I have any feelings?
            What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A
            tangerine that peels in a minute?

                         SIDNEY
                   (caustic)
            I beg your pardon!  I turn myself
            inside out to help you and now I'm
            a heavy.
                   (stooping swiftly as
                   he discovers her shoe)
            Here's your shoe, there's your
            coat, that's the door!

Contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her
arms.  The positive force of his manner gives the girl pause.
There is a silence.  Rita searches for words to explain the
offense to her sensibilities.

                         RITA
            Sidney...I...I don't do this sort
            of thing...

                         SIDNEY
            What sort of thing?

                         RITA
                   (emphatic)
            This sort of thing!

                         SIDNEY
                   (as emphatic)
            Listen, you need him for a favor,
            don't you!  And so do I!  I need
            his column--tonight.
                   (then)
            Didn't you ask me to do something
            about your job?  Don't you have a
            kid in Military School?

A pause.  Sidney has struck brutally home.  Rita's lower lip
trembles.

                         RITA
            You're a snake, Falco.  You're a
            louse, a real louse.

Sidney's manner becomes swiftly sympathetic - but still
urgent.

                         SIDNEY
                   (persuasively)
            Honey - he's going to help you!
            You want to lose your job?

Rita begins to waver, her moral indignation losing ground
before Sidney's reminders of her dire necessity.

                         RITA
                   (remonstrating)
            A girl needs a little romancing
            before she -

                         SIDNEY
                   (cutting in)
            Next time I'll call in a guy to
            paint silver stars on the ceiling!

                         RITA
                   (in a small voice)
            What would you think of me if -

                         SIDNEY
                   (cutting in to
                   reassure her)
            Nothing I didn't think of you before.

                         RITA
                   (dryly, with significance)
            - that's what I mean!

This attempt at humor signals to Sidney that he has brought
her round.  He comes to her, pats her in an encouraging
manner - to which she does not respond.

He turns to the door, and picks up the glasses she has set
down on the table behind it.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he opens the door)
            How many snorts does it take to put
            you in that Tropical Island Mood?

Sidney goes out.

SIDNEY'S OFFICE

Elwell overhears the last remark and as Sidney passes him,
he winks.  While Sidney pours another drink, Elwell faces
the doorway.  Rita comes into it, stands on the threshold.
She is still far from enthusiastic.

                         ELWELL
                   (an inspiration)
            Havana!  That's where we met!

Rita shakes her head morosely.  Sidney comes and puts a
stiff drink into her hand.  Elwell raises the glass toasting
the girl, encouraging her to drink.  Rita responds dimly.

                         RITA
                   (to Otis)
            Here's mud in your column!

Sidney laughs, more from relief than from the joke.

                         SIDNEY
            Blessings on thee, the both...well...
            Gotta run now.  See you two kids
            later!

                         ELWELL
                   (lightly)
            Hurry back.

At the door Sidney takes cheerful leave of them.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
            That gives you lots of leeway.

HALLWAY OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Closing the door, Sidney seems pleased with himself.  He
goes swiftly down the stairs.

INT. SIDNEY'S OFFICE

Rita remains on the threshold of the doorway between the two
rooms.  There is an uncomfortable silence.  Elwell carries
it off by coming to the girl, offering her a cigarette.  She
accepts it.  Elwell studies her, smiling affectionately.
Rita meets his eyes, avoids them again, then quietly offers
the information:

                         RITA
            Palm Springs.  Two years ago.

Elwell begins to laugh.  Whatever the memory, it seems to
amuse him vastly because he continues to laugh.

                         ELWELL
                   (delighted)
            That's right!

Rita drinks.  She adds glumly:

                         RITA
            Don't tell Sidney.

Elwell continues to laugh as we...

                                            CUT TO:

ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

Shooting east on 46th Street walks Sidney, coming out of the
entrance of his apartment, towards CAMERA.  He is pleased
with himself, satisfied with his ingenuity in dealing with
Rita and Bartha.

The streets behind him are dark and empty (it is about 3:00
in the morning).  CAMERA moves with Sidney as he steps
briskly into the orange juice stand and lifts the receiver
from the pay telephone.  There are no other customers at the
counter, but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for
the day ahead, piling up a mountain of empties some of which
fall at Sidney's feet.

EXT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA shoots up at the penthouse on the roof of the Brill
Bldg.  The Budweiser sign is extinguished, a black silhouette
against the sky.  A light burns in the window of Hunsecker's
apartment.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The ringing of the telephone is heard in the big room - an
impressively furnished apartment which has a decor indicating
that the owner thinks of himself in epic terms.

CAMERA moves to discover Hunsecker in robe and pajamas,
tapping at his typewriter.  Taking his leisurely time, he
picks up the phone and eventually answers it.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to phone)
            Yes...?  You sound happy, Sidney.
            Why should you be happy when I'm
            not?
                   (then)
            I'll see the papers when I get up.
            How do you spell Picasso, the
            French painter?
                   (languidly writes
                   down Picasso on his
                   scratch pad, answering
                   a query, dryly)
            It's an item - I hear he goes out
            with three-eyed girls.

ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

CAMERA shoots past Sidney at the phone toward Broadway,
which is now deserted.  A street-flushing truck goes by,
moving through the dead city.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            It would be nice if you mentioned
            R-O-B-A-R-D - Robard's jazz joint --
            it's his 20th anniversary.  Don't
            begrudge it to me, J.J. - I owe him
            lots of favors.
                   (glancing toward the
                   attendant to see that
                   he has not overheard)
            I think you understand, don't you,
            that the Dallas skull is badly
            dented?  Oh, real bad... starting
            today, you can play marbles with
            his eyeballs.
                   (even coquetting)
            Don't hold out on me, J.J., mention
            Robard.  R.O. -
                   (hangs up and walks
                   to street)

HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Hunsecker is writing Robard's name on his pad, but he says
into the phone:

                         HUNSECKER
            We shall see what we shall see...
                   (lazily)
            And don't ever use this apartment
            phone again; I have a nervous sister.

He cradles the phone, looks at it for a moment, switches his
eyes and then physically follows them, rising to stroll
towards the glass doors onto the terrace.  He moves out and
turns aside to look in at the adjoining window, which
belongs to Susan's bedroom.

INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CAMERA shoots across Susan in foreground; she is asleep, a
tired, helpless, sweet kid.  The figure of her brother is
seen - a dark shape on the terrace outside.  He moves away
across the terrace.

EXT. TERRACE - NIGHT

Hunsecker turns from the window.  CAMERA is close on his
brooding face.  CAMERA tracks with him as he crosses towards
the parapet.  At this height there is a wind which blows his
hair and the movement of the camera emphasizes a remarkable
vista of the New York skyline.  The buildings are now dark,
only a few of the electric signs are left on all night.
CAMERA comes to rest looking over Hunsecker's shoulder; it
tilts downward to a view of Broadway below, Duffy Square in
the distance.

HUNSECKER - NIGHT

A close-up; Hunsecker is looking down on his "kingdom".  But
there is little love in the man's face, only authoritarian
power.

EXT. FROM THE TERRACE - NIGHT

From Hunsecker's viewpoint.  The streets empty, except for
an occasional passing taxi.  The street flushing truck comes
up Broadway from Duffy Square...

                                    LAP DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

EXT. FROM THE TERRACE - DAY

The identical camera set-up.  Through the dissolve the light
changes from night to day; Broadway magically becomes a
roaring stream of traffic.

EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - DAY

In foreground a NEWS VENDOR.  Sidney comes out of the exit
of a subway, reaching for his pocket as he approaches the
news vendor who offers him a paper.

                         NEWS VENDOR
            The Globe?

                         SIDNEY
                   (shaking his head)
            Gimme The Record.

Sidney buys and opens the paper.  CAMERA MOVES closer to
shoot over his shoulder.  We see the gossip column which
bears a photograph of Otis Elwell at the top.  Smirking with
satisfaction, Sidney turns away from the CAMERA and throws
the paper into a trash basket before he disappears into the
impressive entrance of a large office building.  The sign
above the doorway reads: THE NEW YORK GLOBE.

                                          QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GLOBE BUILDING

Mary, Hunsecker's secretary, occupies a cubicle which is
separated form the rest of the newsroom by a partition.
From the big room beyond, comes the hum and chatter of a big
newspaper.  The walls of the urgent murmur of the staff of a
big newspaper.  The walls of Mary's cubicle are covered with
photographs; filing cabinets are piled high with unopened
mail; two wire service teletype machines click desultorily.
Mary is plain but attractive, past 30, a level-headed woman
with a sense of integrity.  She is on the phone just now,
bored with the insistent voice on the other end.  Beside her
an earnest young LAWYER waits with several papers in hand.

                         MARY
                   (to phone)
            I have no power to retract, Mr.
            Cummings... I'm only Mr. Hunsecker's
            secretary.  No.  Nor can I agree
            that can retraction is necessary.
            Thank you for calling.

Sidney has come through the newsroom in background.  He
pauses tactfully, seeing Mary occupied with the lawyer.

                         LAWYER
                   (huffily)
            I fail to see what's amusing about
            these papers.

                         MARY
            I'll get the boss to sign them.

                         LAWYER
                   (giving her the papers)
            They're important.

                         MARY
            You've said that six times - that's
            why I'm smiling.

As the disgruntled lawyer leaves, Sidney comes in, wearing
his most winning smile.  With a glance after the lawyer,
making sure that he is not observed, Sidney greets Mary,
assuming a brogue:

                         SIDNEY
            Hello, Mary, me darlin' and phwat
            are ye up to today?

Sidney's hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which
indicates a certain intimacy between them.

                         MARY
            That's a question I usually like to
            ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.

                         SIDNEY
            What about?

                         MARY
                   (shrugging)
            Something about a Frank D'Angelo
            trying to reach you...

Sidney reaches for the phone.  As he does so, Mary hesitates
and glances at a copy of The Record which lies on the desk
open at Otis Elwell's column.  She picks it up.

                         MARY
                   (continuing)
            Is that the man who manages Susie's
            boyfriend?

Sidney murmurs casually, "Yeah.  Why?" as he dials.  Mary
holds up the paper, indicating the item.

                         MARY
            Have you seen this?  In Otis
            Elwell's column.
                   (reads)
            "The dreamy marijuana smoke of a
            lad who heads a highbrow jazz
            quintet is giving an inelegant odor
            to that elegant East Side Club
            where he works.  That's no way for
            a card-holding Party Member to act.
            Moscow won't like, you naughty boy!"

Sidney accepts the paper from Mary, examines the item while
he talks to Sally on the phone.

                         SIDNEY
                   (into phone)
            Sally?  I got the message.  If
            D'Angelo calls again, tell him I'll
            be at the office around noon.

He hangs up, continuing to read.

                         MARY
            Could this be that boy?

                         SIDNEY
                   (casually)
            Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look
            like a reefer smoker...

He discards the paper with a show of disinterest.  Mary
picks it up again.

                         MARY
                   (looking at The
                   Record again)
            If this is true, J.J.'s going to
            hit the ceiling...

Sidney moves around behind Mary.  His eyes are fixed on a
spike which sits on Mary's desk.  On it is impaled a proof
of Hunsecker's column.  Meanwhile, he remarks:

                         SIDNEY
            Can it be news to you that J.J.'s
            ceiling needs a plaster job every
            six weeks?

INSERT

From Sidney's viewpoint, Hunsecker's column.  The shot is
just too distant for us to be able to read the print.

SIDNEY AND MARY

Sidney is looking at the column.  Mary is concentrated on
papers before her.  Without looking up, she is clearly aware
of Sidney's efforts to read the proof.

                         MARY
                   (quietly)
            Sidney, you know that J.J. doesn't
            like people to look at the column
            proof in advance...

Sidney, caught "in flagrante", laughs.

                         SIDNEY
            Mary, I'm not "people" - there's
            Falco blood, sweat and tears in
            that column.

He turns away, changing the subject (apparently).

                         SIDNEY
            How about dinner tonight?

Mary turns to study him.

                         MARY
            Bribing me again?

                         SIDNEY
                   (uncomfortable under
                   her scrutiny)
            And why should I bribe the woman
            who holds most of my heart?

Mary is thoughtful.  Without malice, in a detached sort of
way, she examines Sidney.

                         MARY
            You're a real rascal, Sidney.  I'd
            certainly dislike you if I didn't
            like you.  You're an amusing boy,
            but there isn't a drop of respect
            in you for anything alive - you're
            too immersed in the theology of
            making a fast buck.  Not that I
            don't sometimes feel that you yearn
            for something better...

Sidney finds this analysis hard to take.  Again he tries to
laugh his way out of it.

                         SIDNEY
                   (cynical)
            Mary, don't try to sell me the
            Brooklyn Bridge.  I happen to know
            it belongs to the Dodgers.

Mary, smiling, decides "to let him off the hook".  She takes
the spike and the column and passes it across to Sidney's
side of the desk, as she returns briskly to her business.

                         MARY
                   (affably)
            I don't mind you looking at the
            proof of the column in advance, as
            long as J.J. doesn't know.  But
            don't do it like a boy stealing gum
            from a slot machine.

Sidney doesn't like this; but, on the other hand, he does
want to look at the column.  After only a momentary struggle,
he picks the column off the spike and reads.

                         SIDNEY
            Who put this item in about the
            comic?
                   (reading)
            "If there's a more hilarious funny
            man around than Herbie Temple at
            the Palace, you'll have to pardon
            us for not catching the name.  We
            were too busy screaming." Does this
            Temple have a press agent?

                         MARY
            No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional
            beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's
            funny, so he gave him a plug.

He goes to the door, grinning.

                         SIDNEY
            What's your favorite ribbon to go
            around your favorite chocolates?

                         MARY
            Let's wait till Christmas - it's
            more legitimate then.

She looks after Sidney, thinks about him for a moment.  Then
she types.

EXT. PALACE THEATRE - DAY

Sidney comes down 47th Street from Broadway, making for the
stage door entrance of the Palace theatre.  He walks
confidently into the alleyway, paying no attention to the
old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs
next to the entrance.  The doorman turns, protesting:

                         DOORMAN
                   (calling out)
            Hey!

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

Sidney, without halting, looks back towards the Doorman,
addressing him with the patronizing manner of a superior.

                         SIDNEY
            Herbit Temple here yet?

                         DOORMAN
            Yeah, but you can't come in now!

                         SIDNEY
            I'm in, Sonny Boy!

He is already on his way into doorway.

INT. BACKSTAGE OF PALACE THEATRE

The movie will soon by finished and the comedian who opens
the stage show is ready and made-up in the wings.  He sits
with his agent, (AL EVANS) a small, worried, bespectacled
man, who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself.  They
converse in loud whispers, talking against the muffled and
echoing sound of the film sound track, silhouetted against
the ghostly, distorted images on the big screen seen at a
weird angle behind them.

                         EVANS
            I didn't waste words, Herbie, take
            my word.  I says, "look, Figo, I'm
            not selling you a dozen eggs, I'm
            selling you HERBIE TEMPLE", I says,
            so don't gimme your lip!

The comedian, Herbie Temple, looks up.  Sidney comes through
a fire-proof door which separates the stage from the
corridors to dressing room.  In background two chorus girls
in costume are squeezed into a telephone booth.  Sidney
joins the comedian and the agent; he smiles to the comedian,
while he addresses the agent.

                         SIDNEY
            Hiya, Al!

The agent looks from Sidney to Temple, surprised and
displeased.

                         EVANS
            Since when did you two get
            acquainted?

Sidney has clearly never met Evans; blandly he chooses to
regard the agent's remark as an introduction; he offers his
hand with generous amiability.

                         SIDNEY
            How do you do, Mr. Temple...

The comic accepts the hand doubtfully.

                         EVANS
                   (uncertain)
            Delighted.

                         SIDNEY
            I'm Sidney Falco.

                         TEMPLE
                   (still dubious)
            Yeah, delighted...

Evans stands up, warns the comic.

                         EVANS
            Watch this guy, Herbie, he's a
            press agent.

Temple's smile congeals.

                         TEMPLE
            You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!

                         SIDNEY
                   (in no way discouraged)
            Temple, I caught your act the other
            night and -

                         TEMPLE
            Did you now?  On which bounce?

                         SIDNEY
            - and I just had to drop by and
            tell you how great I thought you
            were.

                         TEMPLE
                   (dryly)
            Cheers.  What time is it, Al?

                         EVANS
            You got ten minutes.
                   (to Sidney)
            Hope you don't mind, Falco: we're
            busy and if -

Sidney stands up.

                         SIDNEY
            No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.

                         TEMPLE
                   (scowling)
            Good!  We're all off to Utica, so
            excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the-
            Portisan.

Sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor.  The
chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth.

                         SIDNEY
            But can I ask one impertinent
            question here?  With no criticism
            intended, because I know, Al, you
            earn your ten percent, how come you
            let a sock act like Herbie Temple
            tip-toe through town without a
            publicity build...?

Smiling wise, Evans shakes his head.

                         EVANS
            We're not buying it, Falco - no
            fish today.

Sidney presses, as if annoyed.

                         SIDNEY
            I'm not selling.  I'm just curious,
            that's all.

Temple turns away from Sidney, leaving him to Evans.

                         TEMPLE
            Answer the man, Al, if he asks you
            a question.  Quick, before he
            thinks up another!

Evans moves to Sidney, trying to shepherd him out the way he
came.

                         EVANS
            Mr. Temple doesn't believe in press
            agents - does that answer you
            something?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on Sidney's elbow.
Sidney doesn't like people touching him.  He reacts in
anger, as we have seen before - fixes a burning eye on Evans.

                         SIDNEY
            Take your hand off, lump!
                   (more politely, to Temple)
            No one believes in press agents,
            Temple, when they make claims they
            can't perform.  I got nothing to
            sell - I didn't come here to
            peddle - but if I tell a client
            that Hunsecker will give him space,
            it's not just talk!

Sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor.
Evans, angry, is stalled for a moment of delay action by
mention of the magic name of Hunsecker.

                         EVANS
                   (after hesitation)
            Listen, you bull artist - !

                         TEMPLE
            Let him go, Al...

SIDNEY

But Sidney has already stepped to the phone booth and is
dialing.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Hello?  Mary, let me speak to J.J.,
            please...it's Sidney Falco...

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting past Sidney in foreground onto Temple and Evans
beyond, they watch him, open-mouthed.  Sidney notes their
reaction.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Tell him it's important...

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Gloria is at her desk, bewildered as she speaks into the
phone.

                         GLORIA
            What?  Is this Sidney?...

RESUME BACKSTAGE OF PALACE THEATRE

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Sure, I'll wait...

While doing so, he glances back with disinterest at Evans
and Temple.  The comedian and the agent exchange looks.
Evans is uneasy; he comes up the steps into the corridor to
address Sidney with a deflated manner.

                         EVANS
                   (hesitant)
            Look, nobody hired you!  We didn't
            talk any deal, and -

With his hand over the mouthpiece, Sidney addresses Evans
with contempt.

                         SIDNEY
            Relax, lump!  I told you I'm not
            selling fish...
                   (abruptly reverting
                   to the phone)
            J.J...Sidney!...How are you,
            sweetheart?
                   (laughing)
            Yeah...
                   (then seriously)
            Listen, I know it's late, J.J., but
            is it too late to add something
            important to the column?
                   (grinning)
            No, not a relative, but important...

RESUME - GLORIA IN INT. OF SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Shaking her head, Gloria places the phone down on the desk,
looks at it as it chatters away.  She considers returning to
her typing, but, worried, picks the phone up again.  Sidney's
chattering voice is barely audible: "You know Herbie Temple,
the comic...?  What about him?  He's at the Palace and he's
great.  That's what about him.  And you'd do me a big bunny
basket of a favor if you would say it in tomorrow's column.

RESUME BACKSTAGE PALACE THEATRE

Temple and Evans are now staring at Sidney with considerable
respect.

REVERSE ANGLE

The comedian and the agent in foreground, Sidney still on
the phone beyond.

                         SIDNEY
            Yeah, if you got a pencil there
            I'll suggest a word or two.
            Uh...uh...

The comedian and the agent in foreground, Sidney still on
the phone beyond.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone, continuing)
            If there's a funnier man in the
            world than Herbie Temple at the
            Palace...uh...pardon us for not
            catching the name, we were too busy
            laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.
                   (then)
            It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks.
            Probably see you at Twenty One
            tonight.  No, for supper, late.
            Right. 'Bye...

            Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr.
            Falco.

                         SIDNEY
            See me in my office.

He turns and walks away down the corridor.  As he vanishes,
Temple starts after him.

CORRIDOR

Sidney walks off in the direction of the exit -- (not so
fast that he can't be overtaken).  Temple hurries into the
corridor and comes after him.  Evans also follows, though
not so eagerly.

                         TEMPLE
            Wait a minute.
                   (turning back to
                   encourage Evans)
            Speak to him, Al.
                   (to Sidney, apologetically)
            Al makes all my deals.

Sidney permits himself to be detained.

                         SIDNEY
                   (coolly, looking
                   toward Evans)
            I don't like a guy that's quick
            with the hands.
                   (to Temple)
            Temple, you've been three passes
            behind for twenty years.  This
            could start you off big - T.V. and
            anywhere.

Evans, not as wholly convinced as the comedian, comes up to
join them.  Temple looks at the agent.

                         TEMPLE
            And it would cost a pretty penny,
            huh?

                         SIDNEY
                   (to Evans)
            You tell him, I stutter!

                         EVANS
                   (shrewdly)
            Uh...Why don't we wait till tomorrow?

Sidney, shrugging, makes a negligent exit.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he goes)
            Wait as long as you like - you know
            where my office is.

They look after him.  Evans face is cold and suspecting, but
Temple's face contains fresh warmth.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

STAIRS OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Sidney comes briskly up the stairs.  Outside his door he
pauses, listens, hearing the murmur of voices inside.  Then
he walks in casually.

INT. SIDNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Sidney steps in, closing the door.  He pretends surprise as
he sees...

ANOTHER ANGLE

...Steve and D'Angelo waiting for him.  Sidney comes into
SHOT.  Sally remains at her desk while Steve and D'Angelo
are silent, looking at Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
                   (perkily)
            What is here, a wake?

D'Angelo rises from the couch, crossing to Sidney to hand
him a copy of the tabloid, The Record.  It is folded open at
Elwell's column.  As he passes it to Sidney, D'Angelo marks
with his thumbnail an item near the bottom of the column.
Sidney takes the paper and reads. (He reads a little too
quickly.)  Then he hands it back to D'Angelo.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve notes Sidney's too-perfunctory reading.

                         STEVE
            You read as you run, don't you?

Sidney turns on Steve, coldly:

                         SIDNEY
            It's a habit with me.  So now I'm
            briefed.  So what?

                         STEVE
                   (glancing at D'Angelo)
            Frank thinks I shouldn't have come
            here -

                         D'ANGELO
                   (a quick correction)
            Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely
            you shouldn't go around wild,
            blaming people without justification.

                         STEVE
                   (watchfully, to Sidney)
            I thought you might have a faint
            idea of how this item originated.

REVERSE ANGLE

Favoring Sidney.  He pauses.

                         SIDNEY
            Why me...?

                         STEVE
            Why not you?

                         SIDNEY
            That's your idea of logic?  I tell
            the Judge I didn't murder the man -
            the Judge says, "Why not you?"

                         STEVE
            Only two men in this town could be
            responsible for that smear - you or
            Hunsecker or both.

                         SIDNEY
                   (explosively)
            Dallas, ask your own manager - he's
            standing here like a pained
            wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell
            are enemies to the knife.  So how
            do you get him doing J.J. a favor?

                         STEVE
                   (quickly)
            It is a favor, isn't it?

                         SIDNEY
                   (as quickly)
            According to you, yeah.
                   (continuing rapidly
                   and with heat)
            Dallas, your mouth is as big as a
            basket and twice as empty!  I don't
            like you, comma, but neither do I
            go along with this column saying
            you smoke marijuana and belong with
            the Reds.  Also, since we're
            talking repulsive, J.J. won't like
            this for two cents!  Don't give me
            that look, Dallas - J.J. believes
            in fair play.  And secondly, this
            could splatter his sister with
            rotten egg by implication - your
            her boyfriend!

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney's manner is a little too vigorous. (In adopting an
aggressive tone, he is really trying to needle Steve.)
Steve, though on the verge of losing his temper, is sharp
enough to notice the point:

                         STEVE
            You're talking very fast.

                         SIDNEY
                   (expostulating)
            Well, I'll tell you what - excuse
            me for breathing, will ya?
                   (wheeling to Sally)
            How do you like it?  He comes to my
            office and -

D'ANGELO

Sensing the danger, D'Angelo moves forward soothingly
between them.

                         D'ANGELO
            Boys, this gets nobody nowhere -
            you're over excited, Steve and -

                         STEVE
                   (sharply)
            Don't apologize for me, Frank!

                         D'ANGELO
            ...excited with good reason, I
            wanted to say.
                   (to Sidney)
            Because this endangers the future
            of the whole quintet...

                         SIDNEY
                   (lightly)
            Should I cry...?

Steve, with a glare at both men, goes to the phone on
Sally's desk.  He dials.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            ...People catch on quick to such an
            item.  Van Cleve already called
            me - he's firing the quintet.

                         SIDNEY
            Then what are you doing here?  Go
            over there and fight!  If Van Cleve
            fires your boy, it gives a lie the
            ring of truth!

In background Steve speaks quietly into the phone:

                         STEVE
            I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker,
            please.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (replying to Sidney's question)
            We're on our way there now...

                         SIDNEY
                   (who has wheeled on Steve)
            What are you calling her for...?

STEVE

Sidney's reaction to the mention of Susan's name gives Steve
food for thought.  While he waits for Susan to be summoned
to the phone, he studies Sidney.

                         STEVE
                   (to Sidney)
            I'm the boyfriend, remember?  I
            hope one day she'll be my wife...
                   (into the phone, gently)
            This is Steve, Susie.  Don't be
            alarmed, Susie, but I want you to
            look at Elwell's column in The
            Record...today...No, about me...

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - SUSAN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Susan is on the phone.  Listening to what Steve says, she is
frightened - almost too frightened; it is as if, in some
curious sense, she had been expecting this blow.  It brings
an echo of an earlier tragedy.

                         SUSAN
            A smear?...What...What kind of
            smear...?  Where are you?

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Steve is on the phone in foreground, the others watching him.
In particular, Sally, who stands near Steve, is studying him
with obvious sympathy.  She looks slowly towards Sidney.

                         STEVE
                   (to the phone)
            We're on our way to the Elysian
            Room to dicker with Van Cleve -
            he's fired us already.  I'll call
            you later, dear... 'Bye!...

He hangs up quietly, looks at Sidney and walks towards the
door.

                         STEVE
            Come on, Frank.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the door closes behind Steve, Frank follows, more slowly.
As D'Angelo reaches the door, he pauses with his hand on the
doorknob and turns back to study Sidney.

SIDNEY

He feels uneasy under D'Angelo's scrutiny.  Sally, in
background, is also watching Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to D'Angelo)
            What are you looking at...?

D'ANGELO

He does not answer for a moment.  The unspoken accusation in
his look is very clear.  Then:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (quietly)
            The ugly world, Sidney...
                   (a pause)
            If I told Steve what I really
            think, he'd tear your head off...

RESUME SIDNEY

He brazens it out.

                         SIDNEY
                   (sneering)
            Tell him.

RESUME D'ANGELO

D'Angelo shakes his head.

                         D'ANGELO
            No.  I'm interested in his future.

D'Angelo goes slowly out.

RESUME SIDNEY

He hesitates before turning towards Sally (because he
realizes that this exchange with D'Angelo must have confirmed
Sally in her suspicions).

SALLY

Her face shows that Sidney is right.  Sally is deeply hurt,
disillusioned.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney turns to her, challenging.

                         SIDNEY
            What's the matter?

                         SALLY
                   (not looking at him)
            Nothing...

Resentfully, Sidney moves about the room.  Sensing the
silent accusation against him, he is aggressive.

                         SIDNEY
            You know, Sally, sometimes I get
            the impression you think you live
            in Star-Bright Park.  This is life,
            kid - get used to it!

Sidney comes to the phone on her desk.  He dials.  Then he
glances swiftly at Sally and, carrying the phone, walks into
the bedroom, dragging the long cord behind him.

INT. BEDROOM

When the phone comes alive, Sidney pushes the bedroom door
shut.  The gesture is as casual as he can contrive to make
it.  Keeping his voice fairly low so that it cannot be heard
in the other room, he says:

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Nikko, is Mr. Hunsecker there?
            This is Mr. Falco.  Well, have him
            call me as soon as he can.  It's
            important.

He sets the phone down on the bedside table, looks at it
thoughtfully before he goes back to the bedroom door, opens
it and goes back into the office.

INT. OFFICE

Sidney stands on the threshold, studying Sally.  His manner
is now more sympathetic as he asks:

                         SIDNEY
            Did you send my folks in Philly the
            check...?

                         SALLY
            Yes.

Leaving the bedroom door open, Sidney comes up to her,
watches her shrewdly, cautiously.

                         SIDNEY
                   (softly)
            I put a lotta trust in you,
            Chickie...

                         SALLY
                   (low-voiced)
            I know you do, Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't judge a situation where you
            don't know what's involved...

Sally is putting paper in the typewriter, trying to hold her
head up.

                         SALLY
            I'm not judging...

Sidney comes closer to her.  He puts his hand on the nape of
her neck, carrassing her.  Under his touch, the girl is
unhappy, and yet at the same time, responsive.  Sidney still
has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame.
Feeling her relaxed, Sidney bends and kisses her on the side
of the throat with more than negligence, for something about
her always excites him; his aggression tune in with her
submissiveness.

                         SALLY
                   (pathetically)
            I swear, Sidney, I can't help it -
            sometimes I wonder what I see in
            you...

                         SIDNEY
                   (murmuring)
            That's no way to talk...

                         SALLY
            Or what you see in me, for that
            matter...

                         SIDNEY
            Stay down town tonight.  Maybe
            we'll take in a show, etc.

                         SALLY
            If you want me to -

The phone in the bedroom rings.  Sidney, reacting sharply,
forgets his advances to Sally as he turns towards the bedroom.

                         SIDNEY
                   (exhilarated)
            You see?  Hunsecker's gotta phone ME!

He goes into the bedroom, closing the door as he goes.
Sally looks at the closed door.

INT. BEDROOM

Sidney has picked up the phone.

                         SIDNEY
                   (calmly)
            Hello, J.J....I presume you saw the
            Elwell smear.
                   (smiling)
            No, no medals - not yet.  Oh, it's
            worse than that - Aunty Van Cleve
            is firing them...from the horse's
            mouth... They were just here - in a
            panic...

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - THE STUDY - DAY

Hunsecker wears a dressing gown as he sits at his breakfast
table.  Behind him are the big glass windows to the terrace
overlooking the Manhattan skyline.  The papers are at
Hunsecker's elbow; his manner is crisp and cold:

                         HUNSECKER
            Who was just there?
                   (then)
            You'll be the death of me.  Sidalee!
            Why?  Didn't you just tell me that
            they've already traced this smear
            to you?  All they have to do now is
            to put two and two together and I'm
            a chicken in a pot!

RESUME SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Sidney smiles confidently, answers calmly:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., peace on earth, good will to
            men - it's working out just the way
            I planned.  Yeah, I guarantee this
            bomb will pop right on schedule,
            but you have to play your part -
            you be a Saint and let me be the
            Devil.  But I wanna talk to you
            first...

RESUME HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

Hunsecker pauses, eyes full of cold voltage.

                         HUNSECKER
            Don't come here.  Susie is up and
            about.
                   (listening)
            He called her?  You'd better see me
            at the TV - three o'clock.

He bangs down the phone, tense thought in his manner.

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Sally is busy with her typing again, but in a depressed mood
when Sidney comes out of the bedroom to put the phone down
on her desk again.  He seems satisfied with himself, smug.
Sally watches him for a moment.  Then:

                         SALLY
            What are you going to do?

Sidney prepares to leave the apartment.  His tone is full of
confidence, self-assertive.  (For once Sidney is certain
that he is smarter, more cunning than even Hunsecker).

                         SIDNEY
                   (the wise one)
            Chickie, a lotta people think
            they're smart.  You watch.  They're
            dumb: they'll do the work for me!
            Just watch.

Sidney makes for the door, goes out.

INT. CIGAR STAND - LOBBY

Susan buys paper - DOLLY with her - toward elevator - she
gets in.

INT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM

J.J. has not moved; he is thoughtful and morose.  Nikko, the
Japanese butler, comes in to remove the breakfast table.

                         HUNSECKER
            The table can wait.  No calls.  I
            have to think about my TV show.

                         NIKKO
            Pleased to do.  I will come back
            later.
                         HUNSECKER
                   (abruptly)
            Did you put the bread out on the
            terrace for the birds?

                         NIKKO
            Yes, but they don't come no more
            this time of year.

Smiling, Nikko leaves.  Hunsecker picks up a pencil and
makes a note on a pad, about birds no doubt.  Abruptly he
looks up, calling:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie!  Come in a minute, dear...

She has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room.  She
comes forward to him; her manner is serious and wary.  His
act is one of a tasteful Mammy singer, but he is watchful,
too.

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, you're very much in my
            thoughts today.

                         SUSAN
            Why?

                         HUNSECKER
            What a question, dear, with that
            newspaper in your hand...

                         SUSAN
                   (pausing)
            Did Sidney tell you about it?

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this
            boy too well.  Anything in these
            charges?

She shakes her head.

                         HUNSECKER
            Not being partial, are you?

                         SUSAN
                   (with quiet certainty)
            No, I'm not.  I'm not!

He soothes, smiles indulgent, but watchful:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, take it easy.  I'll trust
            your judgment - you don't have to
            protest with me.

With a paternal gesture of affection, he holds out his arms,
inviting her into his comforting embrace.  Not wanting to,
she walks into his open waiting arms.

                         HUNSECKER
            Why are you trembling, dear...?

                         SUSAN
            History repeats itself.  Everything
            that happened to Alan Leslie...began
            with a smear like this...

Hunsecker considers this gravely, as if it was a new and
troubling thought.

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes...

She leaves his arms; he watches keenly.

                         SUSAN
                   (incoherent)
            It's just as if I've seen a ghost
            today...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quickly)
            But that wasn't your fault, dear,
            what happened to Leslie.  I've told
            you that a million times...

He goes to her gently; she appraises both him and her
wrenched life with brooding, frightened eyes.

                         SUSAN
            Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It
            was someone's fault, wasn't it?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (gravely)
            I wouldn't have called the boy
            exactly balanced...

                         SUSAN
                   (stronger)
            Alan was not...unbalanced when I
            married him.  And he was
            not...'indifferent to women' no
            matter what they said!
                         HUNSECKER
                   (simply)
            I'm not fighting with you, puss...

She gets up and walks around in considerable agitation.

                         SUSAN
            He never would have killed himself
            if I hadn't gone through with the
            annulment.  Don't you see that made
            all the rumors seem true?  I should
            have stood up for him...not run out.

She turns to Hunsecker, her manner firmer.

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., I want you to get them back
            their job, Steve and the Quintet.

                         HUNSECKER
                   ("incredulously")
            You mean they've been fired already,
            on the basis of this crude smear?

He walks away with a wag of indignation,  but turns, asking:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, you're sure there isn't some
            fire where there's this much smoke?

Susan shakes her head emphatically.

                         SIDNEY
                   (earnestly)
            I know Steve.  No.

                         HUNSECKER
            Then maybe you can tell me if he's
            as solid as you say, why does he
            rap me every chance he gets?

                         SUSAN
                   (involuntarily)
            Sidney is a liar!

                         HUNSECKER
            Who said Sidney?

                         SUSAN
                   (defiantly)
            I said Sidney!...

Staring, he pauses; then he deftly changes the subject.

                         HUNSECKER
            You know, dear, we're drifting
            apart, you and I, and I don't like
            that.

                         SUSAN
            I thought we were talking about
            Sidney?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with rasp)
            Let me finish, dear.  You had your
            say, now let me have mine...

                         SUSAN
                   (interrupting)
            I haven't said anything yet, J.J.,
            but if -

Susan hesitates.  Hunsecker waits for her to continue.  But
she isn't yet sure enough of herself or of the point she
means to make.  She turns away.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (gently)
            I started to say we're drifting
            apart.  A year ago, in your wildest
            dreams, would you have walked by
            that door without taking up this
            situation with me?  Today I had to
            call you in!

                         SUSAN
            I'm taking up the situation with
            you now...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (interrupting)
            Susie, I want to help you--,
            there's nothing I won't do for you.
            You're all I've got in the whole,
            wide world.

Hunsecker strides about, elaborately playing on a note of
disillusion and pain.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            Well, what have I got?  Alimony to
            a pair of tramps?  They're of no
            concern to me.  It's you who count,
            but don't get me wrong - I don't
            intend to let you break your neck
            again!

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., you said you want to help
            me - prove it!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            How?

                         SIDNEY
            Get Steve back his job...please...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (pausing)
            He means that much to you...?

                         SIDNEY
                   (simply)
            Yes.
                   (then)
            With your "prestige" it only takes
            a minute - ten cents worth of
            American Tel and Tel.

                         HUNSECKER
            You're picking up my lingo, hon.

                         SIDNEY
                   (levelly)
            I read your column every day...

He looks at her with pursed lips and, for a change, some
real interest.  Her level, straightforward manner has pinned
him down completely; he shows a slow, charming grin, as he
goes for a private phone book:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, I like this new attitude of
            yours.  You're growing up and I
            like it!  I don't like it when
            you're limp and dependent, when
            you're odd and wayward.  This gives
            you a chance for real survival in a
            very lousy world.  Because, don't
            forget, dear, you won't always have
            me with you, will you...?

                         SIDNEY
            No, I won't...

He crosses to the white desk phone, delaying dialing for a
moment:

                         HUNSECKER
            This Dallas boy must be good for
            you.  Why not bring him around
            today, before the show?  This time
            I'll clean my glasses for a better
            look.

Susan doesn't like this idea, is evasive:

                         SIDNEY
            I'm not sure I can reach him in time.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (easily)
            Sure you can if you want to, and I
            know you'll want to...
                   (then)
            By the way, what's your beef
            against little Sidney?

                         SUSAN
                   (steadily)
            When I'm certain, I'll let you
            know...

                         HUNSECKER
            A man couldn't ask for a squarer
            shake.
                   (into phone)
            Let me have Billy Van Cleve...
                   (then)
            Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how
            I'm tied to your apron strings...
                   (to phone)
            Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about
            that boy?  What boy?  Where are we,
            lug, in a drawing room comedy?
            You're brain is warming up,
            sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...
                   (then)
            No, don't explain your point of
            view, but...

EXT. TV THEATRE - DAY

CAMERA SHOOTS TOWARDS the entrance to the TV theatre.  A
line of people are queuing for Hunsecker's TV Broadcast
which is advertised by large posters beside the entrance.  A
taxi drives up in foreground; Susan Hunsecker gets out.

SIDNEY

Sidney comes up Sixth Avenue towards the theatre.  As he
reaches the corner of the building, he halts, having seen...

SUSAN

Susan is seen in the act of paying the driver.  As the taxi
pulls away, Susan walks CAMERA left.

TV THEATRE

Susan pauses, deciding not to enter the theatre; turning she
looks about her and waits on the sidewalk outside.

SIDNEY

Sidney decides that this is not the moment to approach Susan.
He glances down the sidestreet then moves off in that
direction.

SIDESTREET

Sidney moves down the sidestreet towards a stage entrance,
through which are emerging some TV technicians.  He slips
inside.

INT. TV STATION

Hunsecker is standing at a table, stop watch in hand,
reading aloud from a script which he is rehearsing and
timing.  Beside him sits Mary busy typing more of the
material from Hunsecker's handwritten note.  Mary is calm,
but he is irritable, trying to concentrate despite the
bustle around him.

An old movie star, MILDRED TAM, sits waiting in one of the
canvas-backed chairs supplied for the guests on the show.
BURTON, a manager, also waits, deadpan, at Hunsecker's elbow.
Hunsecker clicks his stop watch as he reads:

                         HUNSECKER
            "I was reminded of it this morning,
            when I noticed that the birds had
            gone South.  We want the same kind
            of freedom for ourselves - that's
            what the man said!
                   (he clicks the watch,
                   pauses to underline
                   the phrase, continues:)
            A man has the right to face his
            accusers!  That's the American Way!
            Who said?  The man said!  From..."

He turns in exasperation to Burton.

                         HUNSECKER
            Burton, don't stand around.  If I
            go over I'll cut some items off the
            tail...

Burton departs.  Mary whips a second sheet out of the
typewriter, hands it to Hunsecker.  As he accepts it,
Hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium.

SIDNEY

SHOOTING towards the auditorium, from Hunsecker's viewpoint.
Sidney mounts the steps onto the stage.  Seeing that the
columnist is surrounded but knowing that J.J. wants to talk
to him privately, Sidney loiters so that J.J. can join him
as soon as he chooses to.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Hunsecker.  Only momentarily distracted by private
considerations connected with Sidney's arrival, Hunsecker
returns to the business of timing the script.  He clicks the
watch again...

                         HUNSECKER
            "From Washington through to
            Jefferson, from Lincoln and F.D.R.
            right up to today - the Democratic
            Way of Life!  That's what the man
            said!  Nowadays it doesn't export
            to well...
                   (then, concluding)
            But you know...and I know...that
            our best secret weapon is D-E-M-O-
            C-R-A-C-Y.
                   (dropping to a modest tone)
            Let's never forget it, ladies and
            gentlemen."

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening,
rapt, to Hunsecker's words.  Sidney is less impressed with
J.J.'s eloquence.  At the conclusion, Mildred applauds
lightly.  She stands up and moves towards J.J.  J.J. wants
to talk to Sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star.

                         MILDRED TAM
            That's grand, just grand, J.J.!
                   (then, anxiously)
            Is my makeup all right?  You know,
            despite the scads of movies I've
            made, I've never appeared on TV
            yet...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (cutting her short)
            Of course, Mildred.  Of course.
            You look fine.
                   (swiftly summoning Mary)
            Mary, help Miss Tam - anything she
            wants; she's our star today.

Under the pretense of studying the typed script, J.J. walks
away across the stage.  Sidney strolls after him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A TRACKING SHOT.  Sidney comes up beside Hunsecker, falls
into step beside him.  As they cross towards a water cooler
at the back of the stage, they talk in rapid undertone.

                         HUNSECKER
            I got that boy coming over here.
                   (a glance at Sidney)
            What's so funny?

                         SIDNEY
                   (who is smiling faintly)
            With a pocket fulla firecrackers -
            good.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (narrowly)
            I think you loused this up but good.
            If I can trust my eyes, and I think
            I can, Susie knows all about your
            dirty work.

                         SIDNEY
                   (shrugging)
            Can't hurt...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (incredulously)
            Can't hurt?  I had to get him back
            his job.

                         SIDNEY
                   (smugly)
            I like that, too.
                   (closer, faster)
            Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in
            one neat bundle, addressed to the
            dumps - to oblivion.  We're going
            great, but please play it my way.
            I cased this kid.
            Know his ins and outs...He's fulla
            juice and vinegar, just begging for
            some big shot like you to give him
            a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a
            favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. -
            the porcupine bit - needles.

                         HUNSECKER
            But it's too late.  I got him back
            the job...

                         SIDNEY
                   (impatiently)
            No, that's the point - he won't
            accept your favor!  The manager
            yes, but not the boy.

A pause.  Hunsecker renumerates.

                         HUNSECKER
            Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll
            tell you that!

                         SIDNEY
            Sure, he steams her up - wants her
            to stand on her own two feet and
            all that jazz!

                         HUNSECKER
            And who's feet is she on now?

                         SIDNEY
            Presumably yours...
                   (a hasty addition)
            That's according to St. Dallas.

                         HUNSECKER
            What's this boy got that Susie likes?

                         SIDNEY
            Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

                         HUNSECKER
            What does that mean - integrity?

                         SIDNEY
                   (repeating as before)
            A pocket fulla firecrackers -
            looking for a match!
                   (grinning)
            It's a new wrinkle to tell the
            truth... I never thought I'd make a
            killing on some guy's "integrity".

Hunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration:

                         HUNSECKER
            Full of beans, ain't you?  But you
            know that you'll stand or fall by
            what you're doing now...

                         SIDNEY
                   (grins; confidently)
            Calculated risk.  Only we happen to
            know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm
            your star pupil -- I reflect back
            to you your own talent.

Hunsecker permits himself a faint smile.  Burton is
approaching with script in hand.

                         HUNSECKER
            I wouldn't like to take a bite of
            you; you're a cookie full of arsenic.

Sidney smirks.  He turns away and goes off towards the
auditorium in the background.

EXT. TV STATION - DAY

Frank D'Angelo pays a taxi out of which he and Steve have
just emerged.  Frank turns towards the boy, resuming a
conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the
entrance of the theatre.

                         STEVE
                   (depressed)
            I still think he's responsible for
            the smear.

                         D'ANGELO
            Not that I'm convinced, but you'll
            never prove it in a million years.
                   (gently)
            Steve, you'll do what you want, but
            it can't hurt; he offers you an
            olive branch - so today like olives!

                         STEVE
            I guess you're right, but -

Steve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head;
compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult.

D'ANGELO

D'Angelo studies the boy with a paternal affection.

                         D'ANGELO
            Steve, sometimes it's better not to
            look at your own honesty; but to
            look the other man in the face.
            Not because you're my meal ticket -
            which you are - but because I like
            you and the boys, please take my
            advice: we -

D'Angelo stops, halted by an expression which he sees in
Steve's face.

STEVE

He is looking through the glass doors of the TV Theatre, no
longer listening to D'Angelo's words; his face has hardened
in anger.

INT. TV THEATRE FOYER

From Steve's viewpoint.  Sidney has come out of the curtained
entrance to the auditorium.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Steve in foreground.  With a movement that suggests his
annoyance at discovering Sidney present, Steve jerks open
the glass door and moves in.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Susan is waiting in the foyer.  She is standing in a position
where she has not been able to see Steve until he enters;
now she moves forward to greet him.  As soon as she is near
him, she speaks in a quiet, urgent manner:

                         SUSAN
                   (in an undertone)
            Steve, before we go in - I'd like
            to...

But she, too, is halted as Steve lays a hand on her arm.
Seeing his look over her shoulder, she turns...

SIDNEY

He is already strolling forward to join them.  CAMERA PANS
with him to include Susie, Steve and D'Angelo.

                         SIDNEY
            Hey, Susie - This is a real
            surprise -- not one but three.
            J.J.'s just finishing up his
            rehearsal.

STAGE

Hunsecker comes forward to the front of the stage looking
towards...

STEVE, SUSAN, D'ANGELO AND SIDNEY

In the group that comes down the aisle of the empty theatre.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies them, then calls out:

                         HUNSECKER
            Looks like a wedding.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker back to CAMERA in foreground; he begins to whistle
The Wedding March to the rhythm of Steve and Susan's walk.

STEVE

He breaks the rhythm of his stride, his face rigid.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He descends to meet them; his manner is full of welcome.

REVERSE ANGLE

Susan nervously makes the introduction - Steve is nervous;
D'Angelo hangs behind warily; Sidney is in background.

                         SUSAN
            Steve, you remember my brother...

                         STEVE & HUNSECKER
                   (together)
            Of course.

Steve shakes the hand that the smiling Hunsecker gives.

                         HUNSECKER
            Well, son, looks like you went out
            and bought yourself a packet of
            trouble...

                         STEVE
            You've been very kind about it, Mr.
            Hunsecker.
                         HUNSECKER
            Give Susie credit for that.  I took
            her word that there was nothing to
            the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll
            have my say about smears on the
            show today.  That's why I'd like
            YOUR personal assurance, too.

                         STEVE
                   (quietly)
            Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to
            that smear.  You have my sincere
            word...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (nodding judicially)
            I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME
            a favor.
                   (pausing; to Susan)
            Be good to my kid sister...

                         SIDNEY
                   (solemnly)
            Yeah, she's had a peck of trouble
            for a kid...

Hunsecker flicks a look at Sidney.  No one else, warier by
the minute, knows what to say.  Hunsecker purrs onward:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie likes to keep her girlish
            secrets.  But in her heart of
            hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she
            fancies you in an uncommon way.
            Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just
            tom-catting around...I hope?

                         SUSAN
                   (quickly)
            J.J., Steve isn't...

Hunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature:

                         HUNSECKER
            Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't
            be much of a man if he didn't
            understand my concern.  Would you,
            son?

                         STEVE
                   (pausing, quietly)
            No, I wouldn't...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (nodding)
            Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I
            like your style, son!  In a world
            of old rags and bones, I like it!
            For instance, take Sidney.

Hunsecker crosses toward Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER (CONT'D)
            If Sidney got anywhere near Susie
            I'd break a bat over Sidney's head!
                   (smiling faintly)
            Sidney lives so much in a moral
            twilight that, when I said you were
            coming here, he predicted disaster.
            You wouldn't take my favor -- you'd
            chew up the job, he said, and spit
            it right back in my face!
                   (sniffing)
            Any truth in that...?

D'ANGELO, STEVE AND SUSAN

Steve is thrown for a loss momentarily; Frank steps in.

                         D'ANGELO
            No, Mr. Hunsecker, and if I can
            amplify --

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

                         HUNSECKER
                   (motionless)
            Don't amplify.

RESUME D'ANGELO, STEVE AND SUSAN

                         D'ANGELO
            Steve wantsa thank you for this
            favor.  He --

GROUP SHOT

                         SIDNEY
                   (provocatively)
            Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just
            told you to shut your mouth!

                         STEVE
                   (hotly)
            Don't you think it's about time you
            shut yours?  Who are you to tell a
            man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!

                         D'ANGELO
                   (warningly)
            Steve, that isn't important --

But Steve, on a heated rip, has turned to Hunsecker:

                         STEVE
            Does he have to be here in our hair?

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
            Why, has he bothered you before?

STEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN

                         STEVE
            Is it news to you?

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
            Son, lots of people tell me I'm a
            gifted man, but I still can't see
            around corners.

GROUP SHOT

                         HUNSECKER
                   (tolerantly)
            Just exactly what are you so hot
            about?
                   (waiting)
            I mean, I know it's a difficult
            thing to be an artist in this
            crudest of possible worlds, but --

                         STEVE
                   (impatiently)
            Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist!
            I'm here as an average Joe, who
            happens to love your sister Susie!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with ironic smirk)
            Well, just be careful you don't
            knock her down, huh?

Steve stops dead.  Then, strangely and dangerously, he picks
up Hunsecker's smile.  On each man's face the smile broadens
and grows up into a chuckle from each; but the meanness
still flickers around Hunsecker's mouth.  Steve is out of
the net!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (affably)
            Frankly, son, you lost me on that
            last hill.  Just give us the punch
            line...

                         STEVE
                   (agreeably)
            No punch line.  Maybe I was just
            admiring your know-how---yours and
            Falco's.

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

                         HUNSECKER
            Why do you keep coupling me with
            Falco?

STEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN

                         STEVE
                   (innocently)
            He's here, isn't he?  Do you think,
            sir, when he dies he'll go to the
            dog and cat heaven?

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Even Hunsecker smiles.  Sidney likes neither the ridicule or
the turn of events.  He moves quickly past CAMERA.

SIDNEY, STEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN

Sidney comes round the row of theatre seats to attack Steve.

                         SIDNEY
            Let's forget cats and dogs and
            other pseudo-literary remarks---
            I'll just lay it on the line!  What
            about that big rumpus in my office
            today?  You were there, Frank!
            Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J.
            was responsible for the Elwell smear!

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
            Don't go wild, Sidney.

GROUP SHOT

                         SIDNEY
            Wild?  Take a look at them and see
            who's wild...

Playing along nicely, Hunsecker looks at Steve and Frank and
slowly removes his arm from Susan; he pauses before asking
Dallas:

                         HUNSECKER
            What about that...?

                         D'ANGELO
                   (uneasily)
            Steve was excited...he didn't mean
            it exactly the way it's stated
            here...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Steve)
            How did you mean it...?

           SIDNEY                         SUSAN
  What he likes to---            J.J., I don't want to say---

With a roar Hunsecker takes them both out of play; he stands
up.

SIDNEY, STEVE, D'ANGELO

Hunsecker enters from behind CAMERA.

                         HUNSECKER
            Both of you keep quiet!
                   (to Sidney)
            You've made more damage here in one
            minute than a plague of locusts!
            If you're tired, Susie, sit down---
            this needs investigation!
                   (to Steve, quieter)
            How did you mean it...?
                   (waiting)
            Come on, let's go!  Let's go!...

Steve is cornered, the other completely out of play.  He
pauses:

                         STEVE
            I don't take kindly to you and
            Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the
            injured party here, you?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with contempt)
            Right now you're in no position to
            ask questions!  And your snide
            remarks---

                         STEVE
                   (stronger)
            Wait a minute, I haven't handed
            over punishing privileges to you
            YET!  Put the whip down and I might
            respect what you're saying...

Switching his leonine tail, Hunsecker looks broodingly at
Susie.  Frank says one beseeching word, "Steve...", but no
one hears him.

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, did you know about this
            accusation...?

SUSAN

                         SUSAN
                   (mutely)
            No...

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
                   (abruptly)
            Before you leave, son, I'll answer
            your question---Susan Hunsecker is
            the injured party here!
                   (balefully)
            Or will I be hearing next that I
            don't even have my sister's welfare
            at heart...

STEVE AND SUSAN

Steve hesitates defensively but can't resist a small smile;
he moves nearer to Susan.

                         STEVE
            Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more
            twists than a barrel of pretzels.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (unturning)
            You hear that, Susie...
                   (to Steve)
            Continue please...

                         STEVE
                   (shaking his head)
            I'm afraid I can't cope with them.

REVERSE ANGLE

Susan in foreground, Steve, Hunsecker and Sidney beyond.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
                   (simply)
            You're too shrewd for me so I'll
            just be honest.  Susie and I love
            each other, if I'm not mistaken,
            and we want to get married.

Hunsecker pauses; Sidney throws in a stage whisper:

                         SIDNEY
            Give him credit---the boy's gall is
            gorgeous!

                         STEVE
            Why don't we hear what Susie has to
            say?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (sardonically)
            That's stout of you, Dallas, but
            Susie may not care to air her
            dismal views in public...

Steve walks to Susie, trying to lift her with his hopes and
air of gentle urging and support.

                         STEVE
            Susie...?

SUSAN

She stares at the floor.

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker doesn't like the drift of things; his mouth
tightens and he speaks to Susan with veiled warning:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, as always, is free to say
            anything she thinks.  Go on, dear,
            say exactly what's on your mind,
            dear.

                         STEVE
            Those "dears" sound like daggers.
            May I suggest that you stop DARING
            her to speak?

                         HUNSECKER
            May I lift my eyebrows?  What is
            this?  What are you trying to do?

                         STEVE
                   (strongly)
            I'm trying to get Susie to stand up
            to you.  But your manner is so
            threatening that she's afraid to
            speak!

                         HUNSECKER
            Son, you raise your voice again and
            you'll be outa here on your golden
            pratt!

SUSAN

Suddenly Susan lets loose, with restrained nervous energy;
she is near to tears.

                         SUSAN
            Steve, if only for my sake, I want
            this stopped!  And the same goes
            for you, too, J.J.!

HUNSECKER

He interjects.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (contritely)
            Susie, I'm sorry if---

RESUME SUSAN

                         SUSAN
                   (bitterly)
            Sometimes I think ALL men are
            fools!...

Restraining tears, she runs up the steps to the stage.

STEVE, HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Steve looks after her.  Sidney watches intently.  Hunsecker's
smile is frostily taunting:

                         HUNSECKER
            You see, Dallas, a plague on both
            our houses...
                   (then)
            We may have to call this game on
            account of darkness...

Steve turns a blank-eyed stare at him.  Tension gone, a slow
mumbling fatigue has set in.  Hunsecker plays it light:

                         HUNSECKER
            If looks could kill, I'm dead...

                         STEVE
                   (slowly)
            No, I don't care about you --
            you're fantastic.  My whole
            interest, if it's not too late, is
            in Susie...and how to undo what
            you've done to her...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (smiling)
            And what have I done to her,
            besides not buy her a new fur coat
            lately?  Sidney, you were right --
            the boy's a dilly.

                         STEVE
                   (stung)
            Why?  Because I don't like the way
            you toy with human lives? - Your
            contempt and malice?  Because I
            won't be the accomplice of your
            sick ego - and the way it's crippled
            Susie...?  You think of yourself -
            you and your column - you see
            yourself as a national glory...but
            to me, and thousands of others like
            me, you and your slimy scandal,
            your phony patriotics - to me, Mr.
            Hunsecker, you are a national
            disgrace!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (blandly)
            Son, I don't fancy shooting
            mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So
            suppose you just shuffle along and
            call it a day...

He turns and stares away, but Steve stops him with---

                         STEVE
            But my day with Susie isn't over
            yet and--

                         HUNSECKER
                   (cold)
            Ten'll get you fifty you're playing
            hookey from a padded cell!

STAGE

Hunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium, Sidney
following closely behind.  In background, beyond, Steve and
D'Angelo are walking up the aisle to the exit.  CAMERA
TRACKS CLOSE on Sidney and Hunsecker.  Hunsecker's face is
rigid.  Sidney, close at his elbow, whispers:

                         SIDNEY
                   (softly)
            You did it, J.J., you did it good...

Sidney is full of confidence.  But Hunsecker barely hears
him (Hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boy's
attack; in particular, by the appalling fear that what Steve
has said is the kind of thing which Susan may also secretly
believe.)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Susan is still standing in the wings.  Mary is with her,
obviously sympathetic.  The girl is drying her eyes with
Kleenex, and Mary glances at her employer with a look of
reproach.  Hunsecker walks round the table, obviously trying
to approach Susan; seeing this, Susan turns away and moves
further from him.  Hunsecker stops.

HUNSECKER

There is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the
girl.  More gently, he moves forward past CAMERA...

SUSAN

Sensing the approach of Hunsecker behind her, she moves away
again; she is still crying, but is trying to recover.
Presently Hunsecker approaches her again.  He speaks very
gently, soothingly, comforting...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (softly)
            You in a mood, Susie, to run over
            to Milgrim's later and buy a few
            new frocks?

                         SUSAN
                   (a small voice)
            No.  I'm going home.

Hunsecker again tries to come nearer to her.

                         HUNSECKER
            Want Sidney to drive you over?

Ignoring the shake of her head, he calls to Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER
            Drive Susie home.

HUNSECKER

Again we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl.
His eyes flick towards the stage behind him where Sidney
stands watching.  He moves gently forward and then speaks in
a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her
reassurance:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie...I...I'd have to take it
            very much amiss if you ever saw
            that boy again.

SUSAN

After a pause, she turns towards him; she looks him straight
in the face.

                         SUSAN
                   (levelly)
            I'll never see him again.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her.
Now he touches her.  His need for her is apparent; he tries
to reach her, tries to find an excuse to embrace her.  She
submits to this very passively.

SUSAN

A VERY CLOSE SHOT.  We see the effort with which she is
controlling herself.

RESUME TWO SHOT

Satisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister,
Hunsecker lets her go.  Susan moves away, still avoiding his
eyes.  Then she goes off towards the steps down into the
auditorium.  Sidney looks at Hunsecker, then after Susan and
follows her.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He goes back to Mary and the script.  He instructs her:

                         HUNSECKER
            Call Van Cleve.  Tell him he was
            right.  Tell him I said the Dallas
            boys are not worthy of his club.

Poring over the typewritten pages, he senses Mary's eyes on
him.  He speaks to her quietly without raising his head and
there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (without looking up)
            Mary...for Susie's own good...don't
            give her misplaced sympathy...

Mary says nothing.  Hunsecker gathers his papers and with a
visible effort to resume his public personality turns
towards the machinery of the television broadcast in
background.

INT. TV THEATRE FOYER

Susan crosses towards the doors out onto the street.  Sidney
comes behind her, watchful as he overtakes her near the
doors.  He goes past her to open the door for her.

                         SIDNEY
            I'll get you a cab...

Susan stops dead.

                         SUSAN
                   (coldly)
            Get away from me.

She goes out into the street.  Beyond, we see a crushing cab.
Hesitating, Sidney adds:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J. asked me to drive you over
            and -

But Susan has already moved out of shot, hurrying across the
sidewalk to hail the taxi.

RESUME SIDNEY

Uncertain what to do, whether to follow her or not, he moves
after her.

SUSAN

She has already opened the door of the taxi.  She turns to
see Sidney come up behind her.  As he enters SHOT, she
repeats:

                         SUSAN
            I told you to leave!  I don't know
            if Steve'll ever talk to me again
            and I'm ready to blame it all on you!

She starts to get into the cab...

SIDNEY

Alert, he moves to detain her (anxious to know exactly the
extent of her suspicion.)

                         SIDNEY
            Susie...!

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Sidney steps up, he grasps at the door of the taxi,
trying to hold it open, but Susan pulls it shut, catching
his fingers in the door.  Sidney steps back in pain...

TAXI

It drives off down Sixth Avenue.

SIDNEY

Nursing the injury to his hand, he looks after the
disappearing taxi.  As he recovers from the pain, his
expression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal.
(Susan's suspicions maybe of less importance than some other
considerations.)

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB WASHROOM - NIGHT

Hunsecker and Sidney are washing in adjoining basins.  Coat
off, the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence.
Sidney, despite his throbbing, bandaged finger, is feeling
satisfied and self-confident.  He hums quietly.  Hunsecker
throws him annoyed side-glances, but Sidney refuses to
"catch on".  The following dialogue is spaced between the
washing, the drying and hair-combing.

                         HUNSECKER
            So that's what "integrity" looks
            like.  Well, I'm always willing to
            learn...
                   (later)
            How is that slob, D'Angelo, your
            uncle?

Sidney no longer hums; after a moment, he answers.

                         SIDNEY
            My mother's side--her brother.
            That reminds me, J.J., Susie looks
            run down.  She can stand a vacation
            and so can you.  People say, "Oh,
            the great J.J., he's made of
            iron!", but you can use a rest, guy.

Sidney's cheerfulness annoys Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER
            What are you so chipper about?  If
            I put a cross on every one of your
            mistakes, you'd look like a
            graveyard!

                         SIDNEY
                   (smiling)
            But not for anything I did today...

                         HUNSECKER
            Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie
            lied to me - she'll see that boy
            again.

Hunsecker moves out of shot.

                         SIDNEY
            You're right, J.J. - she won't give
            him up, but it doesn't matter.
            Because the real "money ball" is
            the boy, not Susan.  And if --

Hearing the sound of the door, Sidney turns sharply.  CAMERA
MOVES to discover that Hunsecker has gone out.  Sidney,
quickly, finishing the brushing of his hair, follows...

INT. DINING ROOM - "21" CLUB

Two waiters are fussing over Hunsecker's table at which
places are already set for Sidney and Hunsecker.  Matre d'
hands him an envelope as he passes.

                         MATRE D'
            Mr. Hunsecker this was to be
            delivered to you personally -

When the columnist comes up to the table, the waiters
quickly pull out the table for him.  Sidney comes to join
him; Sidney gets some attention, but considerably less.
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.

                         HUNSECKER
            These drinks are warm.

                         WAITER
            You said you like to have them on
            your table.

                         HUNSECKER
            What are you a critic?

                         WAITER
            I'll change --

                         HUNSECKER
            Forget it.
                   (to Sidney)
            The real money ball is the boy...

                         SIDNEY
            Yeah, the boy...we're on the verge
            of a farce, a real farce.  As I see
            it, if Susie had stood behind him
            today he might have proved a threat.
            But since primarily he's wedded to
            his work, he's not going to be able
            to take it.

A waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at Hunsecker's
elbow.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to waiter)
            Stop tinkering, pal - that horse
            radish won't jump a fence!

The waiter retreats rapidly.

                         SIDNEY
            In brief, J.J., it's all over
            because any hour now the boy will
            give her up.  Is it a farce or not?

Delicately salting his oysters, Hunsecker looks obliquely at
Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER
            This syrup you're giving out,
            Sidney, you pour over waffles, not
            J.J. Hunsecker!  What do you mean
            that lousy kid will give up my
            sister?

Hunsecker, with a casual gesture, tugs lightly at the end of
Sidney's tie.

Hunsecker's gesture is playful, but it inflicts great injury
to Sidney's dignity; Sidney cannot bear to be touched; he
finds this liberty on J.J.'s part as intolerable as anything
he has experienced, and only with great difficulty controls
himself.  The SHOT FAVORS Sidney.

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Hunsecker continues:

                         HUNSECKER
            Are you listening?

                         SIDNEY
                   (warily)
            How does it matter who's sister?
            The main thing, they're through
            and -

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Without turning, Hunsecker
interrupts:

                         HUNSECKER
            Am I supposed to forget how that
            boy talked to me today?

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney senses a warning in Hunsecker's manner.  He protests:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., is he worthy of a second
            glance from a man like you?  Is he,
            I mean?...

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Pausing during the process of
eating, Hunsecker reaches into an inside pocket.

                         HUNSECKER
            Brief epitaph: "The boy was talking
            when he should have been listening."
                   (then)
            Bite on this.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney as Hunsecker tosses in
front of him an envelope.  Sidney opens it, extracts two
steamship tickets.

                         SIDNEY
            Steamship tickets?
                         HUNSECKER
                   (as he eats)
            For the next sailing of the Mary.
            Susan's run down - she's never been
            abroad and as you so cogently put
            it, I'm not made of iron.

Sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to Hunsecker, who
leaves it lying on the table before him.

                         SIDNEY
            That's good.  Now that louse is
            outa Susie's hair for good.

SIDNEY

He has an instinct to laugh; but something tells him not to.

HUNSECKER

As Sidney makes no response, Hunsecker slowly, carefully
continues in a voice which is dangerously soft:

                         HUNSECKER
            I want that boy taken apart.

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  Sidney puts down his
fork.  He sees now that the issue is serious and must be
faced.

                         SIDNEY
                   (seriously)
            Why do something that would drive
            them right back into each other's
            arms?  Not to mention that this
            time Susie would know who shot the
            arrow...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (interjecting quietly)
            She knows now.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            Why give her real proof?  You
            nearly ruined her with her first
            husband - and you were right,
            J.J., - but she almost followed him
            out the window.  What do you want -
            a chronic invalid?

HUNSECKER

He wants no advice from Sidney.  He interrupts with quiet
savagery.

                         HUNSECKER
            I know how to handle Susie.  You
            just handle the boy, Sidney...
                   (scribbles on scratch pad)
            ...preferably tonight.
                   (pushes pad across to Sidney)


SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  Sidney feels sick.

                         SIDNEY
            Why, what's tomorrow - a holiday?

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as Sidney picks scratch pad up.  We can
read two words: "Get Kello".

                         SIDNEY
            I think I'll go home - maybe I left
            my sense of humor in another suit.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker finishes eating.  During the ensuing speech, which
he begins quietly and sensibly, Hunsecker's venomous feelings
are unexpectedly betrayed.

                         HUNSECKER
            You've got that God-given brain -
            learn to use it!  Do you think it's
            a personal matter with me, this boy?
            Are you telling me I see things in
            terms of personal pique?  Don't you
            see that today that boy wiped his
            feet on the choice, on the
            predilections of sixty million men
            and women of the greatest country
            in the world!  If you had any
            morals yourself, you would
            understand the immorality of that
            boy's stand today!  It was not me
            he criticized - it was my readers!...

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney.  Hunsecker manages to
control himself; he reaches with nervous fingers toward his
scribbling pad.

SIDNEY

Sidney's face has tightened.  He has begun now to realize
the extent of this man's megalomania.  After a moment he
says:

                         SIDNEY
            I'm leaving, J.J....

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

SHOOTING ACROSS Sidney onto Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (a quiet warning)
            Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney;
            you may wanna get back on board.

SIDNEY

Sidney feels the chill of despair upon him.

                         HUNSECKER
            This crab gumbo - terrific!

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  A waiter has come to
serve the next course.  Hunsecker appears relaxed, but
Sidney is sightlessly staring at the piece of paper in his
hand.  He speaks with a quaver in his voice, for he has
worked hard to make a life which is now ready to relinquish:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., it's one thing to wear your
            dog collar...but when it gets to be
            a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.

                         HUNSECKER
            The man in jail is always for
            freedom.

Sidney begins to get up from the table.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he rises)
            Except, if you'll excuse me, I'm
            not in jail.

Hunsecker looks up at Sidney.

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (easily)
            Sure you're in jail, Sidney.
            You're a prisoner of your own
            fears, of your own greed and
            ambition; you're in jail.

SIDNEY

From Hunsecker's viewpoint.

                         SIDNEY
            J.J.  If you're trying to -

He leans over Hunsecker and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Hunsecker in f.g.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (interrupting)
            You, little boy, don't know who you
            are!  Talking around corners with
            the big shots, ten dollar dinners -
            fourteen suits and cashmere coats -
            you tell yourself THAT'S who you
            are!  Later you won't know who you
            are without a penthouse on upper
            Park!  But underneath it all,
            ratting around from day to day, you
            DO know who you are!  You're a
            fearful, ignorant nobody - a poor
            wop kid from the slums of Philly -
            hoping nobody else finds it out!

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP.  He knows the truth of what is said.  But he
takes refuge in quiet retaliation:

                         SIDNEY
            A little hunch occurs to me - you
            have just painted a self-portrait.
            You know who YOU are because you
            scare people - that's what you've
            got against this boy.  He -

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker is prepared to give it out, but not take it.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (cutting in)
            I told you what I want you to do
            tonight!

SIDNEY

He looks down on Hunsecker, leans over the table.

                         SIDNEY
            You're blind, Mr. Magoo.  This is a
            crossroads for me.  I won't get
            Kello.  Not for a life-time pass to
            the Polo Grounds.  Not if you serve
            me Ingrid Bergman on a plate.

CAMERA has PULLED BACK to include Hunsecker, whose attention
has returned to his food.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (over patient)
            Sidney, I told you -

                         SIDNEY
                   (continuing)
            J.J., I swear to you on my mother's
            life, I won't do it.
                   (he leans even closer)
            If you gave me your COLUMN I
            wouldn't do a thing like that...

But as he speaks the last words, Sidney's voice falters
because he has glanced down at the table...

SIDNEY

We see that an idea has entered his head - an idea that
takes the wind out of his indignation.  His eyes lift
rapidly to Hunsecker's face.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (delicately touching
                   the envelope)
            And who do you think writes the
            column while Susie and I are away
            for three months?...

RESUME SIDNEY

He is quite speechless.  Over scene Hunsecker's voice:

                         HUNSECKER (V.O.)
                   (continuing)
            ...The man in the moon?

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

CAMERA SHOOTS across Sidney again onto Hunsecker.  Hunsecker
leans back, looks at Sidney.

Seeing that Sidney has accepted the proposition, he smiles.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (softly)
            Thank you, Sidney.

In a pleasantly affable way, he leans across the table to
tap the hand with which Sidney is leaning on the table.

                         HUNSECKER
            And, Sidney, I'll have that piece
            of paper back...

Helplessly, Sidney unclenches a fist and reveals the slip of
paper which he had meant to keep.  Hunsecker takes it.  With
his eyes on Sidney, he slowly tears it up...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

CIGAR STAND AND PHONE BOOTH - EVENING

D'Angelo is buying a cigar at the counter.  He turns as
Steve opens the door of one of the booths and comes out.
Steve is in a gloomy, irksome mood; D'Angelo is sympathetic
and fatherly.

                         STEVE
            She'll be down in a minute.

CAMERA TRACKS with them as they come out into the hallway.
They move towards the side entrance, away from the elevators.

                         D'ANGELO
            What does she wanna see you about?

The boy shrugs impatiently.

                         STEVE
            She didn't say.

Some passersby come down the hall and enter a waiting
elevator, barely glancing at D'Angelo and the boy.  D'Angelo
feels uneasy.

                         D'ANGELO
            I could think of better places to
            meet her, instead of here.  He
            lives on the whole top floor.

                         STEVE
                   (carelessly)
            I doubt that it matters any more.

D'ANGELO

He addresses Steve soberly.

                         D'ANGELO
            Steve.  You made a very dangerous
            enemy of him today.  Matter of
            fact, I'm very glad we got the tour
            ahead.  If I'm any judge, you hurt
            him today where he lives... He
            won't forget it and he won't
            forgive...

RESUME STEVE AND D'ANGELO

Steve is silent.  He hears the sound of the elevator door
opening and turns.

Susan comes out of the elevator, the one farthest from them,
and looks around.

                         SUSAN
                   (as she comes forward
                   to join them)
            Good evening, Mr. D'Angelo.

D'Angelo acknowledges her greeting, touches his hat and
retires tactfully.  Susan faces Steve.  It's an awkward
meeting.  Each does not know where the other stands.  She
has thrown her fur coat about her shoulders like a cloak; it
will keep slipping off.  He is faintly embittered, a little
hurt and baffled, but he is sympathetic; he is involved and
concerned.

MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT OVER SHOULDER - SUSAN TO STEVE

                         SUSAN
            Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could
            come.

                         STEVE
            Why did you call me?

                         SUSAN
            Would you buy me a cup of coffee?
            In there...

REVERSE ANGLE

Susan nods in the direction of the door into the little cafe.

                         STEVE
            Sure.

As he walks with her towards the cafe:

                         STEVE
            We're on our way to Robard's for a
            benefit.  I've only got five
            minutes...

INT. CAFE

As they enter the cafe, the Counterman looks up from counting
the day's take at the far end.

                         COUNTERMAN
            Too late for service.

                         STEVE
            Just two cups of java.

                         COUNTERMAN
                   (with a twinkle)
            We serve here only moka coffee.

                         STEVE
                   (smiling faintly)
            Make it moke.

The Counterman goes to the urn for the coffee.

SUSAN AND STEVE

A closer angle.  They talk in quiet undertones.  Steve waits
for her to speak first; she starts slowly, hesitantly, with
difficulty:

                         SUSAN
            Steve...what you tried to do
            today...you tried to take me up on
            a high mountain...I couldn't go all
            the way...I failed you...
                   (a pause)
            Will you forgive me?
                   (then)
            Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?

                         STEVE
            Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But
            there's no doubt, Susie, that we
            have to face some serious things...

                         SUSAN
            No one's ever stood up to my
            brother the way you did.

                         STEVE
                   (quietly, to the point)
            But you didn't do much about it,
            Susie.  You walked out, and there I
            was...solo...and not too good at
            that.

                         SUSAN
            I just didn't think that I could
            antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR
            sake, I mean.

STEVE

                         STEVE
            Susie, I was there for OUR sake,
            too.  But what a world it would be
            if we were all afraid to learn to
            walk and talk because it might
            offend poppa!  By the way, I think
            your brother was completely
            responsible for the smears...

SUSAN

This accusation is made lightly, in passing.  But Susan
reacts to it, trying to interject:

                         SUSAN
            Steve, I...

                         STEVE
                   (overriding her)
            But I don't care about that now.
            He knew what he was doing today.
            He was laying down the conditions
            under which he MIGHT consent to our
            marriage - if I would bend to every
            whim of his, like Sidney!  I
            couldn't do that, Susie...

SUSAN

After a pause, she says:

                         SUSAN
            You're saying goodbye, aren't you?

SUSAN AND STEVE

Steve flares up.

                         STEVE
            No!  I'm saying that for your sake
            you have to make a clean break with
            your brother!

                         SUSAN
                   (wrenched)
            But, please, Steve, please - one
            step at a time!  I was born only
            yesterday!...

                         STEVE
                   (pausing, softer)
            I told your brother I couldn't be
            his accomplice.  I can't be yours
            either, Susie, and encourage him to
            go on pulverizing you.  I know what
            type - he's my old man all over
            again!

Susan, pathetically despairing, fingers the handle of her
coffee cup, which she has not touched.  The coat slips from
her shoulders...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve stoops to pick it up, replaces it on her shoulders.

                         STEVE
            This beautiful coat is more than
            just a coat... I hate it!  It's a
            mink straight-jacket!

Susan turns to him.  She is deflated, lacking all will power.

                         SUSAN
                   (drooping)
            Steve, I feel exhausted...what do
            you want me to do?

                         STEVE
                   (not sure of himself)
            Not what you're doing now.  At
            least don't ask me - don't ask him.
            You're fighting for your life!
            What do YOU want to do?

                         SUSAN
                   (pausing, woodenly)
            You are saying goodbye, aren't
            you...?

STEVE

He reacts vigorously, protesting:

                         STEVE
                   (impatiently)
            That's fish four days old...!  I
            can't buy it, Susie!  Right out of
            that mouth I love, like you're a
            ventriloquist's dummy, your BROTHER
            is saying goodbye!  Gee!...you want
            me to be honest, don't you?!

SUSAN

A despairing cry:

                         SUSAN
            No, Steve, I don't.  I don't.  Not
            if it KILLS me I don't!...

SUSAN AND STEVE

It takes her a moment to recover.  When she does so, she
gets up, leaving the counter.

                         SUSAN
                   (without luster)
            Let's not talk any more...you have
            to go...

She moves towards the exit into the hallway; he follows.

HALLWAY

D'Angelo is waiting for them.  Silently they come up to join
him, very depressed.  Susan looks towards D'Angelo, speaks a
little pathetically:

                         SUSAN
            Goodbye, Mr. D'Angelo.  Take care
            of Steve.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (softly)
            I will, Miss Hunsecker.

He walks a little way down the corridor, again leaving them
alone.

SUSAN AND STEVE

She smiles at him, trying to smile, trying to make a joke.

                         SUSAN
            Say something funny...Mr.
            Hasenfeffer.

Steve steps to her quickly, kisses her.  Then he turns and
swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward
glance.  He goes past D'Angelo, who walks quietly after him
towards the exit in background.

SUSAN

She remains just in the attitude in which he left her.

EXT. BRILL BUILDING - NIGHT

Steve comes out of the door, pauses without looking back.
D'Angelo comes up behind him.

                         STEVE
                   (after a moment)
            Look back, Frank, see if she's
            still standing there...

D'Angelo looks discreetly over his shoulder.

SUSAN

From D'Angelo's point of view.  She is still standing where
Steve left her.

RESUME STEVE AND D'ANGELO

D'Angelo turns back to Steve.

                         D'ANGELO
            Still there...

Steve, still without looking back, walks up the street;
CAMERA TRACKING WITH THEM.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (with sympathy)
            Not that I don't like her - she's a
            very lovely person, but who can
            tell?  A year from now you might
            thank your stars that it turned out
            this way.
                   (changing the subject)
            By the way, Robard said that...

Steve, his manner full of pain, stops.

                         STEVE
            Frank, I don't want to make the
            benefit.  They'll be jammin' all
            night, and the way I feel -- I'd
            like to be alone -- I'd like just
            to walk and walk and never come back.

D'Angelo takes him firmly by the arm.

                         D'ANGELO
            No.  I don't leave you alone on a
            night like this.  And, anyway, you
            promised...

Steve looks at him, knowing that he can never shake off the
devoted Frank; he shrugs.  They walk past CAMERA.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The heavy brass doors of the elevator slide open and the
Elevator Man pulls open the grille.  Susan, still in the
mood in which Steve left her, stands in the elevator for a
moment before she realizes that she has reached the top
floor.  As she walks out, the Elevator Man looks at her
anxiously.  CAMERA PANS with Susan towards the door to the
apartment.  Susan fumbles for her key.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

The apartment is dark as Susan enters.  She does not switch
on the lights.  She walks through the shadows of the big
room, which has a grim and menacing atmosphere.  She kicks
off her shoes and, hugging the coat about her for warmth
walks to the glass windows of the terrace.  After a moment
she opens them and steps out.

EXT. TERRACE - NIGHT

Susan walks across the terrace.  At this height the wind is
very strong.  CAMERA TRACKS with the girl, emphasizing the
dizzying panorama of New York at night.  The girl's manner
is strange; she moves as if under compulsion, a sleepwalker.
When she reaches the stone parapet, she leans against it
with her body slumped, still hugging the fur coat as if it
were some protection against her misery.

EXT. FROM THE TERRACE - NIGHT

Vertically downward.  From Susan's point of view.  The stone
sidewalks of Broadway are a terrifying distance below.

SUSAN

An angle, shooting sharply upwards against the night sky.
Wind blows the girl's hair, as she looks fixedly downwards.
Her face is blank, expressionless. (For a moment we may fear
for her, afraid that she may have suicide in mind.) But
presently she lifts her head looking towards the horizon...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA SHOOTS PAST the entrance to Robard's Club, framing
the outline of the bridge in sky in background.  From inside
comes the sound of music -- the Quintet.

The taxi drives up; Sidney gets out; he glances at his
wristwatch, looks around and then makes his way into the club.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Steve Dallas' Quintet on the stand.  CAMERA FRAMES the group
in foreground, SHOOTING towards the entrance way.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Sidney has come in through the entrance.  He is taking off
his overcoat.  He moves forward past the hat check room on
the left, approaching the recess in which several music
cases are stacked beside a coat rack on which the musicians'
overcoats are hung.

DETAIL

As he hangs up his coat, Sidney identifies the other coat, a
black and white check raglan which he (and we) saw Steve
wearing when he visited Hunsecker at the TV Studio.

SIDNEY

A CLOSE SHOT.  The coat appears to have some significance
for him; Sidney is under tension.

A waiter, carrying a carton of beer cans, comes out of the
doorway just behind Sidney, moving between him and the
overcoat.  Thus interrupted, Sidney turns away.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Robard is standing at the bar, surrounded by a group of his
cronies.  Drink is flowing and there is a sentimental mood
of celebration.

As Sidney arrives at the bar, ordering a drink, FRANK
D'ANGELO is seen coming from the interior of the club where
Dallas and the Quintet can be seen playing; D'Angelo accosts
Robard:

                         D'ANGELO
            Lew, Steve don't feel too good...

                         ROBARD
                   (interjecting)
            I'm sorry to hear it.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA shoots past D'Angelo and Robard in f.g. towards
Sidney, who overhears:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            ...So, if you don't mind, he'll
            leave after this set.

In b.g., Sidney sets down his drink, reacting to this
information.  Robard clamps D'Angelo on the shoulder,
reassuring him with warm emphasis:

                         ROBARD
            I like that boy, Frank.  Anything
            he does is okay with me...

SIDNEY

Sidney, thinking rapidly, leaves the bar, moving
unobtrusively but purposefully towards a telephone booth.
He enters and closes the door.

PHONE BOOTH

A CLOSER ANGLE.  Shooting through the glass panel we see
Sidney dialing.  His manner is urgent.

                                      QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

A long shot of the club exterior.  A different musical
number is now being played in the interior. (GOODBYE BABY).
A black car comes swiftly under the bridge, turns into the
little square opposite the club, braking sharply.

CLOSER ANGLE

As the car comes to a stop, CAMERA shoots across the hood
onto the windshield where we see the insignia: POLICE.
The occupants of the car are not visible.

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB

Sidney lingers near the doorway of the club.  He is looking
across the square towards the car which can be seen in b.g.
Now he turns and walks towards the coat rack, CAMERA tracking
with him.  He takes his own coat and, as he thrusts his arm
into the sleeve, contrives neatly to slip some unseen object
into the pocket of Steve's overcoat; CAMERA notes the
gesture, but only very briefly.  Overscene a voice addresses
Sidney:

                         D'ANGELO (O.S.)
            Hey!..........

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP.  As he turns in swift apprehension, we note the
moment of panic in his face.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA shoots past Sidney in foreground towards D'Angelo who
advances on Sidney.  D'Angelo's manner is unfriendly; for an
instant we feel, like Sidney, that D'Angelo may have seen
Sidney tampering with Steve's coat, but then we are reassured
as D'Angelo, deliberately using Sidney's surname, says:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            Mr. Falco...I hate to give you this
            satisfaction - they broke it off
            tonight for good.

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting across D'Angelo onto Sidney, who now relaxes, his
fears ungrounded.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            Tell that to Hunsecker - tell him
            we agree - he's a big man - he wins
            all the marbles!

SIDNEY

As D'Angelo moves away again Sidney looks after him.  Once
more his face goes tense. (He asks himself, does this
development - which he himself anticipated - change the
situation?) He turns away, moving out of shot.

ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA moves with Sidney as he walks towards the doorway.
There he hesitates again; he looks back into the club.

DALLAS

From Sidney's viewpoint.  A LONG SHOT of Steve on the
bandstand.  CAMERA PANS deliberately towards the coatrack in
f.g.  A group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot,
setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up
their coats. (Clearly, Sidney could not now return to the
coat rack - even if he decided that he did want to undo his
handiwork.)

RESUME SIDNEY

CAMERA, shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f.g.
Facing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the
sidewalk.  On the other side of the square the headlamps of
the car blink twice.  Sidney walks towards it.

POLICE CAR

A big man gets out of the seat next to the driver.  As he
comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing
truck illuminate him, identifying HARRY KELLO.  CAMERA PANS
as he walks to meet Sidney.

CLOSER ANGLE

Kello pauses as Sidney comes up to him, asks affably:

                         KELLO
            What's all the rush?  You said
            three o'clock.

                         SIDNEY
                   (glancing back
                   towards club)
            He's leaving early.  After this
            "set".  He'll be out in a couple of
            minutes...

They wait for a moment, listening to the sound of the music
in the distance.  It is a blues number (GOODBYE BABY) Kello
hums nonchalantly; Sidney glances at him with irritation,
finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner.

INT. POLICE CAR

There are two plainclothes policemen inside, one at the
wheel, the other in the back seat.  The latter leans forward
to ask the former:

                         1ST POLICEMAN
            What's this deal tonight?

                         MURPH
                   (the 2nd policeman)
            One of the lieutenant's "surprise
            parties", I think.

Murph's tone shows obvious repugnance.  The 1st Policeman
broods for a moment; he adds in a quiet, but viciously
resentful manner:

                         1ST POLICEMAN
            One of these days I'd like to turn
            in my badge and tangle with "POPSIE"
            myself - he's no good.

RESUME KELLO AND SIDNEY

Sidney, increasingly uncomfortable, turns to Kello.

                         SIDNEY
            Can't you wait up the block?  It's
            not going to look so good, right in
            front of the club...

To Kello this is a great joke.  He laughs, enjoying Sidney's
uneasiness.  He begins to "cat and mouse" Sidney.

                         KELLO
                   (heavily humorous)
            It's nice, Sidney, that you give me
            this tip...

                         SIDNEY
                   (interjecting)
            - He's got them on him.

                         KELLO
                   (solemnly nodding his approval)
            ...And he's got them on him.  I
            appreciate a thing like that - I
            appreciate where you are looking
            out for the virtue of the city.

Sidney, annoyed at this sarcasm, moves past Kello, not
deigning to respond.  As he goes by, Kello grasps him
forcibly by the arm.

                         KELLO
            What's your hurry, Snooks?

CAMERA HAS PANNED to SHOOT towards the car out of which
emerges a second detective.

                         SIDNEY
                   (revolted)
            Take your hands off, Kello...

Kello, holding Sidney, turns towards the second detective in
background.

                         KELLO
            Murph, how do you like this face?
            Why, I'll be darned -- it's melting!
            Something got you scared, Sidney...?
            Listen, rectify me a certain thing.
            Wasn't you kidding, Snooks, when
            you told J.J. I was fat...?

Sidney jerks his arm away, rapidly retreats a few yards, a
safe distance from Kello.  CAMERA PANS with him to the
bottom of the steps.

                         SIDNEY
            Sleep in peace, Kello -- you're
            skinny -- but J.J. says you sweat!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney in foreground, Kello and Murph beyond.  Kello laughs;
but obviously he would like to be nearer to Sidney.  Perhaps
to detain Sidney, Kello drawls:

                         KELLO
            Is that a fact?  He's a dilly,
            ain't he?  By the by, what did he
            have against this boy?

                         SIDNEY
            He goes out with girls.

                         KELLO
            Well, I'll be darned.  And what
            does J.J. think he SHOULD do?

                         SIDNEY
                   (impudently)
            Go out with DIFFERENT girls!

KELLO

He moves forward a little.

                         KELLO
                   (softly now)
            I get the peculiar impression,
            Snooks, that you don't like me.
            Could I be wrong?

SIDNEY

He turns swiftly and goes up the stairs out of Kello's reach.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he goes)
            You could be right, you fat slob?

ANOTHER ANGLE

From half-way up the stairs.  Sidney comes up the steps two
at a time.  Kello and Murphy are seen beyond.

                         KELLO
                   (with a guffaw)
            Come back here, Sidney...I wanna
            chastise you!...

FROM THE BRIDGE

Sidney reaches the top.  He comes along the pedestrian walk
up to CAMERA, slowing down he turns across the rail and
looks down towards the square.  CAMERA MOVES to take in the
scene in WIDE ANGLE: Sidney in foreground, the police car
and detectives below, the entrance to Robard's across the
square.  Sidney waits.  In the distance we can hear the
music of Dallas' last number coming to an end.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB

The last bars of the number.  Enthusiastic applause.

STEVE

He responds to the ovation, nicely but a little wearily.  He
gets down off the stand.  There is too much noise to hear
his parting words to his fellow musicians, but it is clear
that he is urging them to stay without him.  He walks off
towards the entrance to the club.

D'ANGELO

D'Angelo leaves the bar, in search of Steve.  He sees...

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Steve is putting his guitar away in the case, collecting his
overcoat.  In this gesture he is arrested by the sound of
D'Angelo's voice over scene.

                         D'ANGELO (O.S.)
                   (urgently)
            Steve!

Steve, mildly startled, looks up.

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting into the club.  D'Angelo comes forward from the bar.
He is a little drunk, a little emotional.  He waddles toward
Steve, then takes the white carnation out of his buttonhole
and puts it in the buttonhole of Steve's coat, saying:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (fondly)
            Press this in your friendship
            book...Love is a crooked thing,
            friendship not...
                   (then, sheepishly)
            You see, it comes out in the wash
            of a few drinks -- I'm a very
            sentimental guy.

RESUME ROBARD'S CLUB

Steve is touched.

                         STEVE
            I like it that way, Frank...don't
            change.

He picks up his guitar case and makes for the door.  D'Angelo
goes a few paces with him, CAMERA TRACKING.  Then it moves
past D'Angelo, following Steve out onto the sidewalk, where
he stands under the light of the club framed against the
dark background of the square.

FROM THE BRIDGE

CAMERA PANS from the small figure of Steve to include Sidney
big in foreground.  Below him Kello and Murph turn towards
the club.

KELLO

CLOSER ANGLE downward from Sidney's viewpoint.  Kello turns
deliberately to look at the bridge above.

RESUME BRIDGE

Sidney sees Kello's look; he nods deliberately.  Below him
we see Kello and Murphy move swiftly to get into the car.
Sidney, as if shrinking from a sight from which he doesn't
wish to witness, draws back from the balustrade.  He turns
and begins to walk towards CAMERA.

POLICE CAR

A LOW ANGLE SHOOTING upwards at the car, the stairs to the
bridge in background.  As the doors of the car slam, it
starts to move forward and, abruptly, its headlamps are
switched on, glaring into the lens.

EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Steve, concerned only with his only melancholy thoughts,
walks down the sidewalk under the bridge.  The car headlamps
illuminate him in their glare as they move across him.
Steve, without undue, interest, glances back but continues
on his way.

CAMERA SHOOTS eastward towards the silhouette of the bridge.
The Police Car turns as it comes out of the square under the
bridge towards CAMERA.  It moves slowly; again its headlamps
flare into the lens.  CAMERA PULLING BACK includes Steve in
foreground.  Behind him the Police Car slows down at the
curb; it barely stops as Kello slips out of the off-side
door; then the car moves forward along the curb leaving him
behind Steve.  As the car goes out of picture past CAMERA,
Kello strolls across the sidewalk, following Steve.  Steve,
looking past CAMERA, notices...

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA SHOOTS toward 2nd Avenue.  The Police Car slows down
again at the curb and Murph gets out of it, turning to face
Steve.

RESUME

Steve, seeing the man ahead of him, notes something slightly
menacing in his manner and slows down in his walk.  Then,
instinctively, he realizes that there is a second man behind
him, turns to look at Kello.  Kello approaches.

                         KELLO
            Hey, fella...!

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and CLOSER on Steve.  In his face we see
a growing sense of something wrong...

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB

A JUMP CUT.  Loud noise, Chico Hamilton on the drums...

INT. BAR

Another jump cut in the sound track.  Silence.  It is an
empty saloon, occupied only by a solitary drinker at one end
of the long bar, nursing a beer, and by the bartender who is
making out a dope sheet.  Sidney enters, strides to the bar
and throws down a jangling half dollar.

                         SIDNEY
            A bunch of nickels, mister!

While the change is made, Sidney stands with cocked head,
listening in reality or imagination to what is happening
down the street.  As the barman supplies the change, Sidney
goes to the juke box and loads it with nickels saying over
his shoulder:

                         SIDNEY
            A double Johnny Walker Black.  Or
            whatever you got.  Scotch.

Sidney puts both hands on the juke box as if leaning on it.
With a click, drop and whirl, the music box comes to life;
music blares out.  Pausing a moment, Sidney turns back
toward the bar.

SIDNEY

He reaches for his drink, downs it.  He is shivering.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Once more, an abrupt sound transition: the jam session at
full blast.  CAMERA FRAMES the musicians in foreground, but
moves away from them towards the entrance in background.
Near the doorway there is some activity; an attendant
beckons to Robard who is drinking with D'Angelo.  Robard
moves toward the entrance.

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA STARTS on D'Angelo at the bar.  He looks off after
Robard.  There is little concern in his face, but as he
watches, curiosity grows.  He strolls out after the
proprietor.  CAMERA TRACKS with him as D'Angelo comes to
join the little mob of two or three people on the sidewalk.
PANNING, THE CAMERA now SHOOTS TOWARDS 2nd Avenue.  Beyond
the bridge we can see the Police Car.  Kello and Murphy are
beside one of the open doors (into which Steve has been
carried). Murphy turns back, walks a few paces across the
sidewalk and picks up Steve's music case, which he carries
back to the Squad Car.  He gets in and the car drives off.

                         BOUNCER
            Hey, Robard, somebody just picked
            up one of your boys.

                         ROBARD
            What sa -- Wha --

REVERSE ANGLE

D'Angelo's face shows a bewildered astonishment and dismay
as he turns back to the couple of people who are talking to
Robard.  D'Angelo is a little befuddled with drink.  He
pushes towards Robard.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (dazed)
            Whatsa matter, Lou?

                         ROBARD
                   (turning to D'Angelo)
            I'm trying to find out myself.
            They just picked up Steve.

                         LOITERER
                   (blankly)
            Some fat guy...

                         2ND LOITERER
            A cop, a couple of cops.

                         LOITERER
            They smeared him all over the lot.

D'ANGELO

He turns to look back towards the direction in which the
Police Car has departed.  He seems unable to comprehend what
he has heard; but a slow and terrible fear is dawning on
him...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

Susan opens the door to discover Frank D'Angelo in lobby.
He speaks at once:

                         D'ANGELO
            I'm looking for your brother.  Is
            he home?

                         SUSAN
            No.
                   (sensing the
                   seriousness of his manner)
            Mr. D'Angelo - is something wrong?

D'Angelo has no wish to become involved with the girl; he
doesn't reply.

                         D'ANGELO
            When does he usually gets in, your
            night-owl brother?

                         SUSAN
            Seldom before five.
                   (again)
            What's the matter?  Would you care
            to come in a minute?

D'Angelo backs away, shaking his head.

                         D'ANGELO
            No...no.  Thanks.

He turns back to the elevator.  Susan closes the door, but
slowly; she is watching D'Angelo.  CAMERA MOVES WITH D'Angelo
as he goes to the bell of the elevator and rings it.  He
remains in this position, waiting for the elevator, but now
(believing himself to be alone) he leans his head against
the wall and begins to weep, quietly.  Surprisingly, Susan
is abruptly at his elbow, she seizes him forcibly by the
arm, demanding:

                         SUSAN
                   (taut)
            Something's happened.  To Steve.

D'Angelo, with his face contorted in grief and bitterness,
can no longer refuse to answer her.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (in a broken voice)
            He's in the hospital...He's under
            arrest, too... They planted reefer
            cigarettes on him...in his overcoat
            pocket.

Susan is becoming hysterical.

                         SUSAN
                   (wildly)
            Where is he...I want to go to him...

D'Angelo recovers his self control.  There is force and
authority in his voice as he insists:

                         D'ANGELO
            Miss Hunsecker, if you see him
            again they might...might kill him.

Susan is sobered by his seriousness.

                         SUSAN
                   (slowly)
            Who is "they"?

                         D'ANGELO
            Don't ask foolish questions.
                   (then)
            Tell your brother I'm a sensible
            man.  He understands only two
            things - power-politics and homage -
            tell him I came tonight to pay
            homage!

INT. HALLWAY - HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

The elevator door opens and Sidney steps out: He crosses to
the door of the apartment, pushes the button.  The bell is
heard ringing inside.  While he waits, Sidney produces a
handkerchief, dabs his face, straightens his tie; clearly he
is trying to sober up.  He goes to the bell push to ring
again.  Now he notices something that had escaped him
before: the door is not quite shut.  He pushes it open.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

From inside.  Sidney hesitates, enters tentatively.

LONGER ANGLE

The apartment appears empty.  Only one light is lit; the
place is eerie.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney closes the door, goes into the main living room,
CAMERA pans with him.  Something chills him, he calls
softly, "J.J.?"

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney walks towards the study, there is nobody there either.
He goes back towards the stairs to the upper floor; in doing
so he repasses the door of Susan's bedroom, sees that it is
half open, goes to look in.

INT. BEDROOM

From Sidney's viewpoint.  The bed has been slept in but is
unoccupied.  The room is empty.

On the seat at the foot of the bed is a drawer that has been
pulled out of the wardrobe; it contains a collection of
miscellaneous objects, a snapshot album, letters, souvenirs,
disarranged as if someone had been looking at them.

SIDNEY

He looks at the empty room, disturbed.

RESUME BEDROOM

The curtains of the window onto the terrace are blowing: the
window is open.  Sidney walks into shot form behind CAMERA.
He calls:

                         SIDNEY
            Susan?

Susan steps into the room from the terrace, confronting
Sidney.  She is dressed, wearing the fur coat over a skirt
and blouse.  Her manner is very strange; the effect of the
drugs, no doubt.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney is very uncomfortable in her presence; Susan is the
last person he wants to have conversation with.

                         SIDNEY
            Where's J.J.?

He retreats across the threshold of the bedroom, into the
outer room.

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

She walks forwards.

                         SUSAN
            He isn't here...

INT. LIVING ROOM

Sidney stands back to let her pass.

                         SIDNEY
            But he called and said...

Susan comes out of the bedroom, walks past CAMERA.

                         SUSAN
            No, I called...

He studies the girl, says nothing.

LONGER ANGLE

She walks listlessly across the room, moving like a
somnambulist.

                         SUSAN
            Mr. D'Angelo phoned about Steve...I
            went down to the hospital, but they
            wouldn't let me in.  He promised to
            keep in touch with me - Mr.
            D'Angelo, I mean...

RESUME SIDNEY

He watches her cautiously, not sure of how to deal with her.

                         SIDNEY
                   (carefully)
            It's all over town about Dallas...
                   (moving towards her)
            How is he?

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  Susan's expression is blank; her eyes are
unseeing.

                         SUSAN
            He's...unconscious...

There is a tone of great despair in her voice.  Presently,
she recovers, CAMERA eases back to include Sidney beyond.
She glances at him.

                         SUSAN
            I...I gave Steve up...
                   (then)
            Why did you and J.J. do it?

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney looks at her, tensely.  Her voice is so calm, so
certain that Sidney finds it difficult to play-act innocence.
He protests a little too loudly:

                         SIDNEY
            Susie, if I get your meaning,
            you're pitching very wild balls.
            What -

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

Susan interrupts, with a simplicity which is damaging.

                         SUSAN
            Don't bother to lie, Sidney.
                   (moving away)
            I don't care anymore.

LONGER ANGLE

Sidney decides that it is wiser not to argue.  He assumes a
tolerant sympathy.  He moves towards her.

                         SIDNEY
            Listen, get a good night's sleep -
            tomorrow's another day.  Feeling
            sorry for yourself won't help.

                         SUSAN
                   (shaking her head)
            I'm sorry about Steve, not myself.
            I'm even sorry for my brother.  To
            be so lonely, without one real
            friend in the world - to have to
            hang on to a worthless rag of a
            girl like me because she's his only
            real family -

                         SIDNEY
                   (moving towards her again)
            Come on now, chickie, why don't you
            go to bed...?

Now she turns to him.

                         SUSAN
            And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney.
            You're going down with the ship.

                         SIDNEY
            What ship?

She walks past him, still aimlessly wandering about the
room; then she turns back, indicates herself.

                         SUSAN
            THIS ship.

She studies Sidney.

                         SUSAN
            Don't you know how my brother will
            see you after tonight?  You'll be
            the man who drove his little
            stainless sister to suicide...
REVERSE ANGLE

Shaken, Sidney decides to ridicule the implied threat.

                         SIDNEY
            Honey, I'll just have to smile at
            that.

He walks past CAMERA.

RESUME SUSAN

Sidney walks into shot, going past her on his way to the door.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he goes)
            It's late and I'm going home...

Susan, in foreground, remains quite still, says nothing.  In
background, Sidney slows down, his confidence failing him;
he looks back at her.

SIDNEY

He can't go.  Probably, she's bluffing.  But he can't be
certain.  He is suddenly angry.

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

He strides back towards her.

                         SIDNEY
            Susie, whatever problems you have
            with J.J. - I didn't invent them!
            What're you blaming me for?  If you
            learned to let out your hatred you
            would be better off!

                         SUSAN
            Like you?

                         SIDNEY
            Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on
            my own gall - I fight back!  Let
            THEM choke, not me!

                         SUSAN
            I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -

                         SIDNEY
            I know that bit - you're a girl;
            you need a man to give you strength!
            So what do you pick such weak
            sisters for?  Don't you know yet
            that you fight fire with fire, not
            with tear drops?

                         SUSAN
            I could almost forgive you if what
            you did to Steve came from jealousy
            and love...

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            I didn't do anything!

                         SUSAN
            ...but you did it for greed,
            Sidney - and that's pathetic.

She moves past him.  He grips her, turning her around.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't run away - I was always the
            man for you!  I'm talking to you
            out of two years of silence -
            listen to what I say!  Inside of
            six months -

                         SUSAN
                   (helplessly)
            Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -

CAMERA HOLDS Sidney and Susan in foreground.  But it is now
shooting towards the door of the apartment.  A PANNING
movement has included a figure at the other end of the big
room...

HUNSECKER

He is taking off his overcoat near the door of the apartment.
We don't know how long he has been there, how much he has
overheard.  Without appearing to be consciously spying,
Hunsecker is listening to Sidney's voice over scene.

                         SIDNEY
                   (over scene)
            Listen to me, lunatic!  All your
            life you've been doing penance for
            crimes you never committed!  I
            could change that, I'd teach you,
            I'd show you - !

CAMERA PANS round with Hunsecker who strolls across the
room, making his presence known.  Sidney breaks off, drops
his hands, releasing the girl.  Susan turns towards Hunsecker.
Hunsecker lays his briefcase and papers on the table.  He
addresses Susan without looking at her.

                         HUNSECKER
            Go to bed, Susie.  It's late...

Susan makes no move.  Hunsecker glances at her, sees Sidney
but treats Sidney as if he were invisible.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Susan)
            What is he doing here?

Susan walks towards Hunsecker.

                         SUSAN
            I called him.

Sidney moves forward also.

                         SIDNEY
                   (carefully)
            She was depressed - she heard about
            Dallas.

Hunsecker still ignores his existence, he walks past Susan
carrying his papers to the desk.  Susan turns, watching him.

                         HUNSECKER
                   ("controlling" his feelings)
            That subject it might be better not
            to start me on.
                   (angry)
            He's made all the papers tonight.

Hunsecker studies the item in the paper.

SUSAN

She is staring at her brother.  Suddenly, she is unable to
suffer his authoritative air; she goes to him; he ignores
her...

HUNSECKER AND SUSAN

Childishly, she snatches the paper from his hand, throws it
to the floor.  He looks at her.  Patiently, as with a
hysterical infant, he stoops, recovers the paper.

                         HUNSECKER
                   ("mildly")
            Is there something you wanted to
            say...?
                   (as she does not
                   answer, continuing
                   with growing viciousness)
            I've put up with a lot of your
            guff, Susie, because you were a
            child.  But you're a woman now and
            I suspect, despite my best
            intentions, more than a bit of a
            slut...

SUSAN

Her head comes up sharply at the insult.

HUNSECKER AND SUSAN AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker glances at Sidney, clearly reminding them of the
compromising situation in which they were found.  Sidney
moves to answer.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            J.J., if you think -

                         SUSAN
                   (cutting in)
            Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't
            matter now...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            Whose arms will I have to pry you
            out of next?  Not that I don't
            think you didn't invite it!  I know
            that look of yours, that pose of
            being wronged - and how it arouses
            the crusading instinct in even a
            Sidney Falco -

Hunsecker's rising tide of brutality is having some effect
on Susan, and Sidney, fearing for her, tries to intervene.

                         SIDNEY
            I was trying to build her up, not
            tear her down -

                         HUNSECKER
                   (viciously)
            Is that why you were romancing her,
            you mutt!
                   (turning back to Susan)
            Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd
            like it fine if you found another
            home.  That means the front door is
            open!  Pack your things, rent a
            moving van and GIT!
                   (pacing the room)
            And as for marriage, let me hit you
            with a few choice facts: you aren't
            ready for marriage!  You're
            incompetent - a capricious and
            shaky frail with a sick fatality
            for frail and useless men!

Susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near Hunsecker's
feet.  After a moment she turns and moves to the door of her
bedroom; her walk is a little unsteady; she goes inside,
closes the door in Hunsecker's face.

INT. BEDROOM

With the door closed, she leans against it as if afraid of
falling.  She gropes for the door handle, finds the key and
turns it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker is studying the closed door.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to himself)
            Another crisis past.
                   (walking away)
            She'll be fast asleep in five
            minutes, loaded with those headache
            pills...

SIDNEY

Sidney seems not to hear this remark.  He is concentrated on
the door; he moves hesitantly towards it, apprehensive.
CAMERA includes Hunsecker in background.

                         HUNSECKER
            Now we'll get to you, Sidney.
                   (turning to Sidney)
            As far as the column is concerned -
            tonight you have forfeited every
            ethical consideration I ever felt
            for you...

Much more concerned with his anxiety for Susan, Sidney
interrupts.

                         SIDNEY
                   (cutting in)
            Look, J.J., I'll grant you anything
            you want.
                   (as Hunsecker is
                   about to interrupt)
            Susie's off her rocker tonight!  Go
            in and see what she's doing!  Go in
            and talk to her quietly - unless
            you want a corpse!

Sidney's conviction is impressive.  But Hunsecker is
unwilling to admit the danger, he continues.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (acid)
            Let me finish what I started to
            say -

Seeing that Hunsecker is not taking his advice, Sidney
strides swiftly to the door of Susan's bedroom.  He knocks
on it.

INT. BEDROOM

SHOOTING TOWARDS the door.  Susan is sitting on the bed in
foreground.  In a methodical, hypnotic way, she is destroying
the contents of the drawer, tearing letters into small
fragments.  Sidney's voice is heard outside: "Susie!" Susan
appears not to hear it; CAMERA TRACKS closer to her.
Sidney's voice is heard again, louder: "Susie!" Susan turns
sharply towards the door.

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  Susan rises to her feet, staring at the door.
She begins to back away from it.

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA PULLS BACK as Susan glances down at the record player
beside her.  She turns the knob.  We hear the clatter of a
record dropping and music begins.  The tune is "The Sage."

INT. LIVING ROOM

CLOSE SHOT of Sidney.  He hears the music starting.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker has come forward.  But now, as he listens to the
gramaphone record playing in the bedroom, Hunsecker relaxes,
assuming that this is a sign that Sidney's suspicions are
unfounded.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (coming forward)
            What a cornball you are, Sidney...

CAMERA TRACKS to include Sidney.  He does not share
Hunsecker's confidence; he knocks again, calling:

                         SIDNEY
                   (anxiously)
            Susie!
                   (in growing fear)
            SUSIE!

CAMERA TRACKS closer to Sidney.  As he tries the doorknob,
CAMERA TILTS DOWN.  Sidney's hand tries the doorknob, finds
it locked, shakes it forcefully.

DETAIL

From inside the bedroom.  We see the doorknob rattled.

RESUME SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  She realizes that Sidney means to insist.  She
turns away towards the blowing curtains in background.

RESUME LIVING ROOM

A DETAIL SHOT.  Sidney's hand is still shaking the doorknob.
He releases it.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to a TWO SHOT of Sidney
and Hunsecker as Sidney retreats from the door in
apprehension.  Now Hunsecker has begun to share Sidney's
anxiety.  He moves to the door, knocks and then pounds on it.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with authority)
            Susie, this is J.J.!  Open up!

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  She comes forward past the blowing curtains.
The wind whips at her hair.  Over scene we hear the rumble
of the traffic on Broadway far below.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He is pounding on the door again.  CAMERA makes a quick pan
to Sidney who, in a split second, realizes that Susan may
have gone out on the balcony.  He turns, dashes towards the
study to look out on the terrace.

RESUME SUSAN

She has now started to climb onto the parapet.  Sidney leaps
into shot, dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of
shot.  We hear Susan cry out, a hysterical gasp.  CAMERA,
looking through the windows of Susan's bedroom, sees the
door fly open as Hunsecker bursts into the room.  He looks
swiftly around, advances towards the open window.
Exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone, he switches it
off; he steps out onto the terrace.  CAMERA PANS with him as
he turns to look back into the study where Susan's inanimate
figure is sprawled on the floor, half across the low
upholstered footstool.  Sidney, white and shaking, is
standing over her.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA at floor level.  Susan is framed in foreground.  The
lower half of Sidney can be seen beside her.  Hunsecker is
on the terrace in background.  Shocked, he moves quickly
into the room.

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE UP.  He looks down at his sister.  He is badly
shaken.  The sharp bite of terror produces a reaction of
something akin to anger.  But he swiftly controls it.  He
moves past CAMERA.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker stoops into shot.  Tenderly, he lifts the girl's
body to get it into the arm chair.  Susan is quite lifeless,
limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any
instinct for self-preservation.  But as she feels her
brother's arms, and as she recognizes who it is, she breaks
out in hysteria.

                         SUSAN
                   (wildly)
            No!  NO!  Don't touch me!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (sharply)
            Susan!...

But Susan strikes at him, a vicious gesture of revulsion.
Hunsecker lets her go.  She falls into the arm chair, her
face hidden from him; she begins to sob.

                         SUSAN
                   (her body shaking)
            Go away!...Go away!...

Hunsecker would like to comfort her, but he dare not touch
her again for fear of inviting another rebuff.  He is deeply
hurt and wounded.  Embarrassed that Sidney should watch this
moment, Hunsecker rises.  To cover his emotion, he walks to
the tray of drinks in background; he pours a brandy and
comes back.  Stooping, he offers it to Susan.  Her only
reaction is again to wrench herself away from him, facing
the opposite direction.

                         SUSAN
                   (sobbing bitterly)
            GO AWAY!

Hunsecker sets down the drink, stands up.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (in a choked voice)
            Talk to her, Sidney...

                         SIDNEY
                   (hushed)
            Talk to her yourself...

Over scene the telephone rings.  It is ignored.  While
Hunsecker looks down at the girl, helplessly, the telephone
continues to ring.

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  It is she who first becomes aware of the
telephone.  Her weeping has stopped now.  Slowly, she raises
her head.  CAMERA EASES BACK to include Sidney beyond her;
he notes this movement, seeing in it a revival of the girl's
will to live; he is moved.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The telephone is framed in foreground, Susan beyond.  It
continues to ring.  As Hunsecker crosses to his desk to pick
up the instrument, CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Hunsecker speaks:

                         HUNSECKER
            Yuh...Yuh...
                   (he listens)
            Just a minute...
                   (turning back to Susan)
            Susie, it's Mr. D'Angelo - from the
            hospital...

RESUME SUSAN

A CLOSE SHOT.  She raises her head higher, still weakly.  We
see in her face a mixture of terror and hope.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker comes forward to set down the telephone in front
of her, on the footstool.  Hunsecker and Sidney watch.  She
reaches a hand, which is still trembling, picks up the
receiver.  Her voice as she speaks to the instrument is
barely audible.

                         SUSAN
            Yes...yes...yes...

Presently, she hangs up.  When she becomes aware that
Hunsecker and Sidney are waiting for an explanation, she
tells them:

                         SUSAN
                   (speaking with difficulty)
            Steve...is out of danger...

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker nods.  He already knows this.  Then:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (soberly)
            That means a lot to you?

SUSAN

She does not look at him, she lowers her eyes but answers
with a nod.  And then, more positively:

                         SUSAN
            Yes.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies the girl.  His face has hardened.  He moves,
beginning to pace. (And also beginning his 'manipulations'.)

                         HUNSECKER
            But I have to warn you, Susie - for
            your own sake - he'll still do
            time...

CAMERA FOLLOWS Hunsecker.  It now takes in Sidney who is
standing beside him.  Sidney has begun to stare fixedly at
Hunsecker. (He is now realizing that Hunsecker, although he
has been faced with this demonstration of the girl's
willingness to kill herself, has still learned nothing, is
still continuing in the old pattern.)

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing, warming
                   to his theme)
            He's a hop-head - that's a felony
            in New York.  I can try, of course,
            to...

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP.  Revolted, Sidney breaks in:

                         SIDNEY
            You're unholy, J.J.!  You'd rather
            kill this girl than let her go!

GROUP SHOT

Hunsecker wheels on Sidney, bellowing:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (in blind rage)
            GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

Sidney, with equal heat, spins round to Susan, crying out
before he has time to check himself:

                         SIDNEY
                   (impulsively)
            Susie, YOU get out of this house! -
            Get out before it's too late!

SIDNEY

Sidney has gone too far now to pull back.  Inevitably, he
continues.  During the speech, CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Susan and then Hunsecker.

                         SIDNEY
                   (with sincerity)
            Listen with care - this will cost
            me everything, so you know I'm
            telling you the truth!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (trying to stop him)
            You're incapable of the truth...

                         SIDNEY
                   (who will not by stopped)
            Susie, there's nothing wrong with
            Dallas!
                   (turning toward Hunsecker)
            Your brother and I arranged it all.
            And if the Leslie boy is still a
            squooshy item in your life, forget
            it! - your brother arranged that
            one, too!  I don't usually give
            away presents; but this is my gift
            to you: Get out of here!  Leave
            this man!

During the latter part of the speech, Susan rises slowly to
her feet, staring first at Sidney and then, with fearful
significance, at her brother.  Hunsecker does not look at
her; he is concentrated on Sidney.  Twice he has been about
to demolish Sidney, but he now stops, A THOUGHT IN HIS HEAD.

HUNSECKER

He is perfectly controlled, smiling.

                         HUNSECKER
            Like most Italians, Sidney's got a
            big gift for dramatics.  I, however,
            prefer the cool and stubborn facts.
            Sidney has not appeared in my
            column in weeks - check that fact
            with Mary.  That leads right to
            another fact: Sidney had nothing to
            lose tonight!  To the contrary,
            dear - ONLY HIS OBVIOUS GREED TO
            BEAT HIS WAY BACK INTO THE COLUMN
            EXPLAINS HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME!
            In brief, BLACKMAIL!

Hunsecker pauses impressively.

GROUP SHOT

Framing Hunsecker in foreground, Susan and Sidney beyond.
Susan listens to Hunsecker objectively, with a mounting
sense of his diseased reasoning.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            Mind you, not that one true fact
            didn't come out of Sidney's mouth
            tonight: self-admittedly, he
            committed a vicious crime of
            jealousy against Steve Dallas!
                   (pausing)
            Now we have to clear Dallas, don't
            we?...But I'll have to sacrifice
            him...
                   (he indicates Sidney)
            ...to do it.
                   (turning to Susan)
            Am I doing right?

SUSAN

She is looking at Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (over scene)
            Yes or no, Susie...?

Slowly, Susan nods.

REVERSE ANGLE

SHOOTING ACROSS Susan onto Hunsecker.  Hunsecker turns away
from her and walks to the telephone.  He picks it up and
begins to speak.  While the scene continues, we hear his
voice off screen, speaking to the phone, saying: "This is
J.J. Hunsecker.  I want you to get a message through to
Lieutenant Kello.  Ask him to ring me back.  It's urgent."
Susan backs slowly away from Hunsecker.  Then she turns into
CAMERA, which TRACKS with her and includes Sidney.  Susan
looks at Sidney and then, ashamed, avoids his eye.  But
Sidney comes nearer to her.  Susan is deeply distressed.

                         SUSAN
                   (very quietly)
            He's sick.

She looks again at Sidney.  Deliberately, Sidney nods.
Susan walks toward her bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM

Susan comes into the room, finding shelter from the
revelation which has so appalled her.  Inexorably Sidney
follows her.  He comes across the threshold, closes the door.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quietly)
            Yes, he's sick and you're the only
            idiot alive who didn't know it.

A pause.  Sidney moves closer to her.

                         SIDNEY
            But what are you going to do?

There are some tears of pity in Susan's eyes.  Once more she
moves away from Sidney.  Sidney senses that her compassion
for Hunsecker might easily lead her once again to slip back
into the trap.  He insists:

                         SIDNEY
                   (with emphasis)
            You don't owe your brother a cup of
            water!

Another pause.  Sidney again repeats:

                         SIDNEY
            What are you going to do?

She moves away from Sidney, CAMERA following her.  After a
moment, she answers:

                         SUSAN
            Go to Steve.

SIDNEY

Sidney is moved, having done his solitary act of chivalry.
To hide his feelings, he is harsh:

                         SIDNEY
                   (sharply)
            For Pete's sake, straighten out the
            seams of your stockings - comb your
            hair - don't be so helpless all the
            time!

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Susan.  From the other room, we
hear the telephone ring.  Sidney turns and goes quickly out.
After a moment, Susan looks back at the door through which
Sidney has disappeared.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Hunsecker is framed in foreground, speaking into the
telephone.  Sidney is in background, outside the door of
Susan's bedroom.  Hunsecker is fully aware of Sidney's
presence, as he says:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to phone)
            No, he's admitted that, Harry.  My
            kid sister's a witness.

SIDNEY

A CLOSE SHOT.  He watches Hunsecker with a curious detachment.
Producing a cigarette, he lights it and then looks up
towards Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (over scene)
            No, he admits he planted the stuff
            on the Dallas boy...

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker framed in foreground, Sidney beyond.  Hunsecker
has at the same time been tapping a cigarette on the desk.
Sidney walks across to Hunsecker, offers the lighted match.

HUNSECKER - REVERSE ANGLE

As he accepts the light he continues speaking to the phone:

                         HUNSECKER
            Yeah...jealousy.

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Sidney turns on his heel, walking out of the apartment.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...He's been trying to make my
            sister behind my back.

CAFE ON BROADWAY

Kello is in a phone booth.

                         KELLO
                   (to phone)
            Oh, that's serious, J.J.  Real
            reprehensible...

Kello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through
the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls
ahead to a position ready for him outside the door.

                         KELLO
                   (to phone)
            Don't worry, I'll get there.  I'm
            on Broadway now.

Kello hangs up.  Hurries out.  We see him get into the squad
car which rapidly accelerates.

INT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM

Hunsecker has hung up.  He stares at the telephone for a
moment.  Then he moves towards Susan's door, CAMERA TRACKING
with him.  He comes to the threshold, looks at Susan who is
standing in much the same position in which Sidney left her.

SUSAN

Unaware that her brother is watching her, she picks up the
fur coat on the bed. (She is about to start packing her
belongings.) She turns as she hears Hunsecker speak.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (over scene)
            That's a pretty coat.

REVERSE ANGLE

SHOOTING ACROSS Susan, towards Hunsecker.  Hunsecker comes
into the room.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            - but it's about time you had a new
            one.

Susan turns squarely to face him.

RESUME SUSAN

She braces herself to tell him:

                         SUSAN
                   (soberly)
            I'm leaving, J.J.

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

He does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone
(or, if he does, refuses to recognize it.)

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with a faint scoff)
            Don't kid a kidder.  I'll see you
            for breakfast around eleven.

Without waiting for a response, Hunsecker goes out, closing
the door.  Susan stares at it for a moment.  Then she moves
to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed.

TERRACE

Hunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace, comes out and
looks over the parapet, (looking to see how far Sidney has
got, hoping to see Kello's squad car.)

RESUME SUSAN

She completes her simple packing, closing the suitcase.
With a gesture that is obviously automatic, she starts to
put on the fur coat; then she halts, realizing what she is
doing.  She pauses; CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  Now, deliberately
she throws the coat back on the bed.  CAMERA PANS down with
the gesture.  She looks down at the coat, the discarded
symbol of her dependence upon her brother.  CAMERA PULLS
BACK again as she takes a quick look round, then goes to
take a duffle coat from the wardrobe.  She throws this over
her arm, picks up the suitcase, goes to the door.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Susan comes out of the door.  She moves with a sober
determination, expecting to find Hunsecker in the room.
CAMERA TRACKS with her.  But then she realizes that Hunsecker
has gone out on the terrace.  She takes a step or two
towards him, then pauses.

HUNSECKER

From Susan's viewpoint, SHOOTING through the big glass
windows.  Hunsecker is at the parapet.  He is impatiently
looking down into Broadway.

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  She now realizes that there is no point in
saying goodbye to him: she has already told him that she is
leaving and, if she becomes involved in further argument
with him, it can do no good.  Yet there is some emotion on
her face as she takes a last look at her brother; she turns
away.

HUNSECKER

Framing him in foreground at the parapet.  Susan can be seen
through the windows before she disappears to the door.
Hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on Broadway
below...

EXT. BROADWAY

The squad car comes down Broadway at speed.

EXT. DUFFY'S SQUARE

Sidney is walking across the square.  The squad car appears
in foreground; it pauses hardly at all as Kello slips out of
it, and starts to move after Sidney.  Then the car
accelerates round Duffy Square to cut Sidney off on the
other side.

SIDNEY

Sidney comes up towards CAMERA.  Seeing something ahead, he
halts...

SQUAD CAR

From Sidney's viewpoint.  The car breaks to a stop.  It's
door opens and a detective gets out slowly.  It is Phil.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney is framed in foreground, the squad car beyond.
Sidney knows what this means.  He starts to speak before he
turns to look over his shoulder.

                         SIDNEY
            Hello, Harry...

REVERSE ANGLE

Kello, moving silently up behind Sidney, slows down, amused
at Sidney's prescience.

                         KELLO
            Hi!
                   (coming to join Sidney)
            I just been on the phone to J.J.

Kello's manner is almost affectionate.  He shakes his head,
admonishing Sidney.

                         KELLO
                   (mildly)
            You been a bad boy, Sidney.  J.J.'s
            going to write about you in his
            column tomorrow.

REVERSE ANGLE

SHOOTING ACROSS Kello onto Sidney.  Sidney's smile is tired.

                         SIDNEY
            I thought he would.

                         KELLO
            Yeah...
                   (then)
            And another thing - he's gonna say
            you 'resisted arrest'...
                   (as Sidney nods)
            You know J.J....!

Sidney turns away to look back towards Phil.  Then, taking
Kello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop
viciously across the mouth.

KELLO

Kello's head jerks back.  Recovering at once, he guffaws,
lurches into CAMERA with a sudden vicious movement.  There
is a sharp guttural cry over scene.

LONGER ANGLE

Phil runs forward towards the figures of Sidney and Kello
seen beyond him.  In doing so, he blocks the view so that we
do not clearly see the violence with which Kello strikes
Sidney down.  Phil, in foreground, is seen to relax.  When
he moves aside, clearing the view, Sidney is writhing on the
ground at Kello's feet.

CLOSER ANGLE

Kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief.  He signals to
Phil to help lift the body at his feet.  Phil enters shot
and they raise Sidney, half carrying, half dragging him out
of shot.

LONG SHOT

The cops carry the figure of Sidney Falco across Duffy
Square; they bundle him into the police car.  The pigeons in
the square, circle.

HUNSECKER'S TERRACE

CAMERA LOOKS down towards Duffy Square in the distance.  The
police car can be seen moving off, circling the square and
disappearing southward on Broadway.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Hunsecker in foreground.

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE SHOT, SHOOTING sharply upward at Hunsecker.  He
looks down, quiet impassively, and there is a slightly
insane grandeur, a paranoiac superiority in the way that he
turns back, dismissing Sidney from his thoughts.

INT. LIVING ROOM

CAMERA SHOOTS towards the closed door of Susan's room.
Hunsecker walks into the shot, stops before the door.  He
begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt, clearly
preparing to go to bed.  As an after-thought, he comes back
to the door, addresses it:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (gently)
            Susie?
                   (getting no answer)
            Are you in bed...?

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  It is at a low level, still emphasizing
the man's dignity.  He strolls for a few paces.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            I don't have to tell you, of
            course, that I cleared your
            boyfriend's name; I didn't let you
            down...

CAMERA has now moved so that we are shooting past Hunsecker
onto Susan's door.  He gets no answer except silence.

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE SHOT, REVERSE ANGLE.  We now see in his face a
flicker of fear.  With what is clearly an effort, he
reassumes a confident manner.

                         HUNSECKER
            ...I was saving this news for
            breakfast, but I think I'll jump
            the gun!  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AND
            DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS
            TOWN HAS EVER SEEN!

Still no answer from inside the bedroom.  Hunsecker's forced
expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face.  He
calls out:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie...?

INT. BEDROOM

The room is quite empty.  CAMERA SHOOTS across the bed
towards the door in background.  Susan's discarded fur coat
lies on the bed.  And the doors of the wardrobe are open.
Hunsecker's voice can be heard continuing over scene:

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (outside)
            I'm getting the Mayor to perform
            the ceremony and - NO, I think I'll
            fly the Governor down from Albany...
                   (a pause)
            Do you hear...?

A pause.  Then, very tentatively, the bedroom door is opened.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (outside)
            Are you listening?...

Now he opens the door and comes in.

HUNSECKER

A BIG CLOSE UP.  The sight of the empty room freezes his
face for a moment.  His eyes look round.

INT. BEDROOM

From Hunsecker's viewpoint.  A PANNING SHOT, from the open
door of the cupboard to the fur coat.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Hunsecker.  He steps to the bed, picks up the coat.

REVERSE ANGLE

There is a dazed, incredulous look on his face.  But, as he
glances over his shoulder, CAMERA ZOOMS PAST him towards a
little door in the wall behind him: It is ajar, showing a
couple of inches of light.

RESUME HUNSECKER

Once again Hunsecker reassures himself that Susan must be
behind the door.  But his voice is even more false as he
declares:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (a note of anger
                   appearing in his voice)
            Susie!...You won't threaten
            me!...Nobody walks out on J.J.
            Hunsecker!
CAMERA NOW MOVES CLOSER and closer to Hunsecker.  The ANGLE
is a weird one, tilting grotesquely upward.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            You need me - you all need me!...

Hunsecker, his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat,
walks towards the door.  CAMERA PANS with him.  He stands a
few inches from the narrow opening.  He seems about to push
the door open further, but is afraid to do so.

INT. BATHROOM

CAMERA SHOOTS ACROSS the bathtub, showing enough of the tiny
room to make it clear that it, too, is completely empty.
Through the slit in the door, we can see only a glimpse of
the movement of Hunsecker outside.  Hunsecker's voice
continues:

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall
            not want".
                   (a sneering laugh)
            That's bunk in a book!  I'm the
            Shepherd of millions of little men
            and women!...

INT. BEDROOM

A DOWNWARD ANGLE, SHOOTING past Hunsecker to the door.  As
Hunsecker retreats from the door, he is still clutching the
fur coat.  He stands alone in the middle of the room and his
gestures are a little wild.  CAMERA rises higher to shoot
down at Hunsecker, alone in the little room.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...I don't ask them to get on their
            knees, but they come to me for
            advice and guidance!  Who are you
            to reject me!

With an increasingly eccentric manner, Hunsecker strides out
of the bedroom door into the living room again.

INT. LIVING ROOM

A similar ANGLE, SHOOTING down on Hunsecker as he comes out
of the bedroom.  But as he starts to roam the vast room,
CAMERA rises higher still, pulling backwards and upwards to
a LONG SHOT which holds the entirety of the big room in all
its ugliness.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            What makes YOU fit to sit in
            judgment on a man like me.  Only a
            great person understands another
            great person, and that leaves you
            out!

Hunsecker is now addressing the whole of the apartment, no
longer pretending even to himself, that the girl is still
listening.  He moves off towards the windows to the terrace
where the curtains are now blowing in the morning wind.  He
goes out towards the terrace, his voice becoming more
distant - a man shouting empty nonsense, addressing no one.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            - That leaves you ALL out!  You're
            pigmies!  You're all sick, weak
            midgets!  I'm proud to be alone!...

EXT. BROADWAY

CAMERA SHOOTS STEEPLY UP towards the top of the Brill Bldg.
(At this angle Hunsecker's terrace will not be visible but
its position is established in relationship to the Budweiser
sign.) CAMERA PANS DOWN to pick up the figure of Susan
Hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto
Broadway.

CLOSER ANGLE

Susan pauses on the sidewalk.  She stays there for a moment.
She breathes in the fresh morning air, looking around with
the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes.
Then she starts up Broadway - away from the Times Square
area.  The girl's step has a purpose in it; she has
confidence and courage.  Music for the end titles is quiet,
simple and lyrical.

                 THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS

FADE IN:

EXT. INT. GLOBE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DUSK - N.Y.

A row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the
long loading bay, waiting for the edition.  In the foreground
a large clock establishes the time as 8:10 PM. A rumbling
noise warns the men to take their positions; a few seconds
later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes
onto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto
the trucks.  Much noise and shouting.

The front truck moves out to the city street.  As it does
CAMERA EMPHASIZES the big poster on its side.  The design
features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims - a
trademark of Hunsecker's. (It will later be seen as the
masthead of the gossip column.)

                     "GO WITH THE GLOBE"

                            Read

                       J.J. HUNSECKER

                   "They eyes of Broadway"

EXT. BROADWAY - DUSK - N.Y.

The truck starts on its journey along Broadway.  Some shots
are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic (taken
from a camera car).  Others are from the inside of the
truck; as it slows down, the delivery man tosses the heavy
bundle of papers onto the sidewalk.  CAMERA following the
truck, holds it in foreground against the blazing electric
signs of Broadway and Times Square.

EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

The southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and
46th Street, CAMERA, fairly high, shoots north towards the
impressive vista of electric signs, silhouetted against the
darkening sky.  Very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks.
CAMERA descends towards the Orange Juice stand on the
corner, passing the booth which sells souvenir hats.  It
moves through the congestion of chattering passersby,
steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man, who stands
at the counter of the Orange Juice stand.  Oblivious of the
hub-bub around him, SIDNEY FALCO is concerned only with his
private problems.

He turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb
behind him; this is what he has been waiting for...

CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT

The news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the
sidewalk besides a newsstand.

DETAIL

The bundle of newspapers.  It hits the sidewalk with a smack.
CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney Falco crosses the sidewalk.  The
owner of the newsstand, IGGY, comes to pick up the bundle;
he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor;
Sidney snaps his fingers with impatience.  Iggy wears
spectacles and is clearly more or less blind, he has to
grope for the cord that binds the papers.

                         IGGY
            Aw Lady, if I looked like you, I'd--

                         SIDNEY
            C'mon...C'mon...

                         IGGY
                   (recognizing Sidney's voice)
            Keep ya sweatshirt on, Sidney.

Majestically taking his time, Iggy lifts the bundle to his
stand and cuts the cord.

                         IGGY
            Hey, Fresh, the Globe just came
            in -- Hey, Sidney, want an item for
            Hunsecker's column?  Two rolls get
            fresh with a baker!  Hey, hot, hot,
            hot -- etc.

Annoyed, Sidney throws him a dime, seizes a paper and
returns briskly to the orange juice stand.

ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

Sidney's place at the crowded counter has been taken by
newcomers.  Rudely, he recovers his half-consumed glass of
orange juice and sandwich.  He takes them further down the
counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the
paper.  CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM, picks up further snatches of
overheard dialogue. (See dialogue attached at the end of the
scene) We move close enough to see Sidney's hands open the
paper expertly at HUNSECKER'S column - identifiable by the
picture of the spectacled eyes.  Over scene there is a
babble of offstage dialogue.

CLOSE UP OF SIDNEY

His face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column.
He is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment.

EXT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - BROADWAY - NIGHT

CAMERA SHOOTS WEST on 46th Street, as Sidney comes down the
side street from the newsstand in background.  Irritably, he
jerks open the door of a shabby entrance.  As the glass door
closes, Sidney is seen striding up the stairs.

FIRST FLOOR - OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Beside the top of the stairs is the door to Sidney's office.
On it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads:

SIDNEY FALCO

Publicity

From inside comes the sound of desultory typing.  Sidney
comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door.

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SALLY is on the phone as Sidney strides in.

                         SALLY
            Just a minute, Mr. Weldon.  I
            think...

Sidney vigorously indicates that he doesn't want to take the
call.

                         SALLY
                   (to phone)
            I'm sorry.  I thought that was Mr.
            Falco returning.  Yes, I'll tell
            him when he comes in.  I know he's
            been trying to reach you.

She hangs up.

                         SALLY
            That's the third time he's called
            today.

                         SIDNEY
            He wants me to break a leg?

                         SALLY
                   (literally)
            No, an arm, he said.
                   (then)
            I told him you were sure the item
            would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column
            in tomorrow's...

                         SIDNEY
                   (interrupting, sharply)
            It isn't.  I've just seen the early
            edition.

                         SALLY
            But...

                         SIDNEY
            But what?

                         SALLY
            That makes five days in a row that
            Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his
            column.

                         SIDNEY
            May I rent you out as an adding
            machine.

He has begun to change his clothes.

                         SIDNEY
            Get me Joe Robard.

Sally goes back into the outer room.

                         SIDNEY
            Who else phoned?

                         SALLY
            The renting agent and the tailor.

                         SIDNEY
            Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.

                         SALLY
            It won't leave much of a balance in
            the bank...
                   (to phone)
            Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?

Sidney, in a state of semi-undress, comes to take the phone
from her.

                         SIDNEY
                   (gloomily)
            Watch me run a fifty yard dash with
            my legs cut off!

Very abruptly, he comes alive on the phone.  A real laughing
boy.

                         SIDNEY
                   (effusively)
            Sidney, Joe.  How do you like it?
            I'm running out of alibis!  No, I
            asked Hunsecker to withhold the
            item, until he could give it a
            fine, fat paragraph.  The column
            was running over and I didn't want
            you kissed off with just a line...

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Robard is a stolid, secure man, balding and with a moustache.
He has a morose sense of humor.  He is speaking from a
telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar.  In
background, the Club is open, but there are few customers as
yet.  Some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians
are still arriving, strolling past in background, depositing
their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned
to them.

                         ROBARD
                   (in answer to Sidney)
            Of course.
                   (he listens to
                   protest from Sidney)
            What is this, Sidney, a kissing
            game?  You're a liar - that's a
            publicity man's nature.  I wouldn't
            hire you if you wasn't a liar.  I
            pay you a C-and-a-half a week
            wherein you plant big lies about me
            and the Club all over the map.
                   (a pause)
            Yeah, I mean in that sense.  But
            also in the sense that you are a
            personal liar, too, because you
            don't do the work I pay you for.
                   (new protests on the
                   other end of the line)
            Oh, stop it, Sidney.  You're from
            the country, not me.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sally is watching him, unhappy on his behalf.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Now, wait a minute, Joe.  When I
            saw J.J. last night he said...

But Robard has cut off.  Sidney hangs up.  A silence.  Sally
tries to be comforting.

                         SALLY
            I wish I could help in some way,
            Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
                   (aggressively)
            Help me with two minutes of silence!

Sally, hurt, says nothing.  Presently, he adds:

                         SIDNEY
            Go home, Sally.  It's late...

                         SALLY
            I hate to see you like this --

Sidney, with another mercurial change of manner, begins some
sarcastic clowning.

                         SIDNEY
                   (horsing around)
            Yes, but as a new subscriber you're
            under no obligation to take more
            than three books.  And if you mail
            the enclosed card within ten days --

                         SALLY
                   (pleadingly)
            Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't
            do a dance with me...

                         SIDNEY
                   (still clowning)
            You mean you don't want the extra
            free gift of a colorful giant map
            of the world???

                         SALLY
                   (distressed)
            Sidney, please, dear, if you feel
            nervous...

Sidney is abruptly savage.

                         SIDNEY
                   (with cruelty)
            So what'll you do if I feel nervous?
            You'll open your meaty, sympathetic
            arms...?

                         SALLY
                   (breaking down)
            Sid...you got me so...I don't know
            what...

She is crying.  Sidney feels uncomfortable.  Not too
generously, he relents:

                         SIDNEY
            You ought to be used to me by now.

                         SALLY
                   (pathetically)
            I'm used to you...

                         SIDNEY
                   (with a touch of bitterness)
            No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no
            hero.  I'm nice to people where it
            pays me to be.  I gotta do it too
            much on the outside, so don't
            expect me to kow-tow in my own
            office.  I'm in a bind right now
            with Hunsecker so --
                   (grimly)
            Every dog has his day!
                   (going)
            Lock up and leave the key.

The phone rings.  Sidney is dressed by now.  As Sally goes
for it, he makes for the outer door.

                         SIDNEY
            If that's for me, tear it up!

                         SALLY
            Take a top coat.

                         SIDNEY
            And leave a tip in every hat-check
            room in town?

He is already gone as she picks up the phone.

                         SALLY
            Sidney Falco office... Oh, Miss
            Kay, he tried to reach you.  No,
            he's at the barbers now.  No,
            that's held over till the Tuesday
            column...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ELYSIAN ROOM - NIGHT

The quintet.  As the dissolve clears, a clatter of polite
applause greets the end of a previous number.  CAMERA is on
the bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five
musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the
leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo
to...the bass, who "walks" with the beat, bringing in...the
drums, which start a quiet, insistent wire-brush background
for...the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases,
set the stage for...

STEVE DALLAS

...the guitar, the leader again.  It comes in after this
short preamble with the first statement of melody. (The tune
has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the
themes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the
background score of the title music.) CAMERA lingers a
moment on the guitarist, STEVE DALLAS.  He is a youth of
pleasant, intelligent appearance.  He plays with the intent
air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work
very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in
the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening
audience.

SIDNEY

A close shot.  Sidney has just entered the club, strolling
into the vestibule near the entrance.  He wears an expression
of oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward...

DALLAS

Seen in long shot from Sidney's viewpoint.  CAMERA moves to
include Sidney in foreground again.  He turns as he is
accosted by RITA, the cigarette girl of the club.  She is a
pert creature, attractive and not unaware of the fact.

                         RITA
            Don't you ever get messages,
            Eyelashes?  I called you twice.

                         SIDNEY
                   (irked)
            I've been up to here.  Listen,
            honey, tell me something.  You know
            Susan Hunsecker...?
                   (Rita nods)
            Has she been in?  I mean lately, in
            the last coupla days...?

                         RITA
            I don't think so.

                         SIDNEY
            You're sure.  Find out for me.

                         RITA
                   (with a nod)
            Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?

Rita wears an injured air.  Sidney, preoccupied with other
worries, callously ignores it.

                         SIDNEY
            Is Frank D'Angelo around?

                         RITA
            At the bar - Sidney...

But Sidney has moved away from her.

D'ANGELO

He is at the bar, listening with satisfaction to the music,
watching the performers and studying the audience.  Sidney
comes up behind him.  We see Sidney's eyes flick from
D'Angelo towards the bandstand and back again.  Then, as he
takes the stool next to D'Angelo, he assumes a different
manner, a sulky resentment.  D'Angelo sees Sidney.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (to the bartender)
            Joe, give my nephew a drink.

                         SIDNEY
                   (sullen)
            Your nephew doesn't want a drink.

D'Angelo is still watching the quintet.  The guitar can be
heard again.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Shooting past D'Angelo and Sidney towards the bandstand.

                         D'ANGELO
            That's a lollipop that, boy.  The
            kid is only great.

                         SIDNEY
            And with ten percent of his future,
            you're great, too, Frank.

D'Angelo looks quickly at Sidney, sensing the undercurrent.
Then he turns his back on the musicians, remarking in a
quiet tone.

                         D'ANGELO
            Went over to Philly yesterday an'
            seen the folks...it's nice you send
            them the fifty a month...

                         SIDNEY
                   (after a pause)
            See my mother?

                         D'ANGELO
                   (shaking his head)
            I only had a few hours.

A glum moment.  Frank sips his highball: Sidney lights a
cigarette, animosity on his face.

                         D'ANGELO
            Thanks for the publicity spread you
            got the boys for the benefit
            tomorrow.

                         SIDNEY
                   (begrudgingly)
            Robard's my client.  I did it for
            him and his club, not your boys.

Frank again notes Sidney's resentful manner.  Sidney looks
towards the musicians.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quietly)
            Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (quietly)
            Looka, Sidney, you're my own
            sister's son, but where does that
            give you the right to call me a liar?

                         SIDNEY
                   (looking towards Steve)
            You told me that your boy was
            washed up with Susie Hunsecker,
            didn't you?

                         D'ANGELO
            Yeah, and it's the truth, to the
            best of my knowledge.  And, frankly,
            I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm
            glad, not yours.  I manage these
            boys and I got their best interests
            at heart.  Steve shouldn't get
            mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

                         SIDNEY
                   (narrowly)
            You told him that?

                         D'ANGELO
            Not in those exact words - you know
            what a temper he's got.

A pause.  Sidney is thinking.

                         SIDNEY
            When do these hot-headed boys of
            yours go on the road?

                         D'ANGELO
            Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.

                         SIDNEY
            That's a nice tour.  All booked?
                   (Frank nodding)
            When was Susie around here last?

                         D'ANGELO
            Four five nights ago.  That's how I
            know the romance is off.  Also
            Steve's in a very bad mood.

                         SIDNEY
                   (abruptly)
            Listen, Frank, you'd better make
            sure you're telling me the truth.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (annoyed)
            I don't like this threatening
            attitude.  When it comes to it,
            what the heck is it your business
            what they do, this boy and girl...

RITA

Locating Sidney, she comes up behind him.  He turns away
from D'Angelo as she whispers to him.  As she departs,
Sidney turns back.

                         SIDNEY
            If you knew Hunsecker as well as I
            did, you might understand why it's
            my business.  Maybe you're walking
            around blind, Frank, without a cane.

Sidney gets off his stool.  Casually, but to effect, he adds:

                         SIDNEY
            ...and in case you didn't know it,
            Susie Hunsecker's out there on the
            back step right now.

He turns away, glancing towards Steve on the bandstand
behind him.

D'ANGELO

He looks disturbed.

INT./EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD

From D'Angelo's point of view.  CAMERA LOOKS UP at Steve.
The Quintet is now reaching the end of the number, a driving
rhythm of considerable excitement.  A waiter passes in f.g.
and the CAMERA CRANES BACK through the curtained doorway to
the backstage part of the club.  This movement is continued
as we see some other employees, including Jerry Wiggins, the
intermission pianist, who is waiting in the corridor near
the fire-exit.  As he steps out of the door to discard a
cigarette, CAMERA AGAIN CONTINUES ITS MOVEMENT, CRANING BACK
AND DOWNWARD into the little courtyard.  Here, it discovers
the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow
near the steps of the fire-escape, listening to the music.

CLOSER ANGLE

This is SUSAN HUNSECKER.  She wears an expensive mink coat.
It is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is
sensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic.  A girl
in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her
capacity.  Over scene, the music continues.  Susan shifts
her position, knowing that the session will soon be at an
end and that the musicians will be coming backstage.

INT. ELYSIAN ROOM

Steve is playing the last bars of the number; the whole
group now in unison.

QUINTET

The music comes sharply, dramatically to its finish.  There
is some applause.  The boys relax.  Steve reaches for the
microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of
the "cool" musician, announces the end of the set, thanking
the audience, identifying the quintet by name and introducing
the intermission pianist.  During this, Carson, Chico and
Paul wander off the bandstand behind him.

EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD

Chico, Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage.
As they do so, Chico, glancing out of the open door sees
Susan in the courtyard.  He goes out onto the fire-escape;
Paul following behind.

                         CHICO
            Hi!  Susie...

                         SUSAN
            Hello, Chico.  Paul.

                         CHICO
                   (to Paul)
            Throw a rope round this chick while
            I go get Steve.

Chico goes swiftly back into the club.  Paul remains with
Susan.  There is a momentary silence; Paul is embarrassed
because Susan is.  Susan makes an effort at conversation,
she nods towards the club.

                         SUSAN
            Full house...?

                         PAUL
            Packin' 'em in.

INT. CLUB

Steve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles, a
much-too-earnest devotee of progressive jazz.

                         DEVOTEE
            I'm terribly interested in jazz --
            serious jazz.  You studied with
            Milhaud, didn't you?  This is such
            an interesting fusion of the
            traditional, classical form with
            the new progressive style, I just
            wanted to ask you how you came to
            form the group...-

CHICO

He comes through the curtains of the doorway, pausing as he
sees that Steve is involved with the Intellectual Young Woman.

REVERSE ANGLE

Steve glancing at Chico over the shoulder of the Intellectual
Young Woman.  Seeing that Chico has something to say to him,
he wriggles out of the young woman's clutches by passing the
buck to the unfortunate to Fred Katz, who is descending from
the bandstand behind him.

                         STEVE
            Well, we just sort of got together.
                   (turning to introduce Fred)
            Maybe if you ask Mr. Katz...He
            writes the stuff, you know.

                         FRED
                   (blankly)
            Huh?

RESUME CHICO

Steve joins Chico and they go through the curtains into the
corridor outside.

CORRIDOR

Chico, smiling, explains:

                         CHICO
            Don't waste your time there, man.
            You've got something better waiting
            outside...
                   (as Steve looks at him)
            Susie's out there.

STEVE

His reaction betrays some emotion. (Over scene the
intermission pianist has begun to play a Blues number.)
Steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard,
then hesitates - almost as if he was afraid to go out.  He
meets Chico's eye again.

                         STEVE
            What did she say...?

CHICO

He is amused, but sympathetic.

                         CHICO
            You proposed to her, not me.
                   (slapping him on the back)
            Go get your answer...

COURTYARD

Susan, waiting at the foot of the iron steps, turns as Steve
comes out on the fire escape above.  Steve comes quickly
down the steps towards her, slowing down when he gets a few
paces away from her.

SUSAN

She looks up at Steve.

STEVE

A CLOSE SHOT.  In his expression we read his mute inquiry...

RESUME SUSAN

Quite deliberately, with her eyes moistened by love and
affection...she nods.

REVERSE ANGLE

Great relief and happiness can be seen in the boy's face.
After a moment, he moves to her and she to him.  They
embrace swiftly, hold each other close and then kiss with
passion.  Presently, when the kiss is over, Susan speaks
softly.

                         SUSAN
                   (in a whisper)
            Steve...I'll...I'll try to make a
            good wife.

Steve is still too choked with relief to speak.  For answer,
he clasps her more tightly to him.  The beam of light which
falls on the iron stairs behind them, narrows and then is
extinguished...

CORRIDOR

Paul has closed the door.  Turning, he shares a look with
the grinning Chico and Fred Katz who has managed to escape
from the young woman.  Before there is time for either of
them to make a remark, Sidney comes through the curtains
from the Club.

                         SIDNEY
            Hi, Fellows.  Where's the Chief?

Sidney's manner is very friendly.  But it is immediately
apparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none
of them likes Sidney.  Fred is deliberately uncomprehending.

                         FRED
            Who?

                         SIDNEY
                   (who gets the point)
            Dallas.  Is he around?

Chico's back is to the closed door which opens onto the
courtyard.  Chico nods in the opposite direction towards the
stairs.

                         CHICO
                   (unhelpfully)
            Yeah, he's around somewhere.
            Upstairs, maybe.

                         SIDNEY
                   (coldly, as he goes)
            Thanks.

COURTYARD

Steve and Susan are still embracing.  Steve is exultantly
proud and happy.

                         STEVE
                   (incoherent)
            This is big, you know.  Very big!
            Let's go out later, drink some
            firewater.  With the boys.  Fred
            can call Millie and -

                         SUSAN
            Steve, I'd rather you didn't say
            anything for a day or two...until I
            tell my brother...

STEVE

His sobering reaction shows this is something important.

                         STEVE
                   (gently)
            You haven't told him yet...

SUSAN

                         SUSAN
            I'm telling him in the morning
            after breakfast.

STEVE AND SUSAN

Turning her head, she makes a little gesture, an unconscious
movement, putting her fingers to her brow as if feeling a
headache.

                         STEVE
            He isn't going to like it.

Susan says nothing.  She looks to Steve, smiling, but the
smile is not too confident.

                         STEVE
            You sure you don't want me to be
            with you...?

Susan stoutly shakes her head.  Defensively she reassures
Steve:

                         SUSAN
            Steve, my brother isn't as bad as
            he's painted.  He isn't perfect,
            but -

                         STEVE
            But he isn't going to like this,
            Susie.  And he makes you nervous,
            not me.  No, I take that back - he
            makes me nervous, too.  But I
            wouldn't give him a second thought
            if not for you.

The topic evidently makes Susan uneasy.  In an effort to
dismiss something that she does not want to think about,
Susan puts her arms around Steve's neck again.

                         SUSAN
            Let's forget him and -

But Steve is not so ready to change the subject.

                         STEVE
            His stooge, Falco, is around - I
            saw him walk in.
                   (soberly)
            He's been spying on me for weeks,
            Susie.

                         SUSAN
                   (quickly, perhaps too quickly)
            Darling, I don't care - really I
            don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush
            on me for years, but nothing we do
            is his business -

                         STEVE
                   (gently insisting)
            But he could be reporting back to
            your brother, couldn't he?

                         SUSAN
                   (pleading)
            Steve, dear, please forget all of
            this.  What can it matter after
            tomorrow?

Now Steve responds.  He grins, holds her closer.

                         STEVE
                   (softly)
            I have a message for you; I love
            you.
                   (kissing her lightly)
            May I dedicate the next number to
            you?...And the next, and the next.
            Every Sunday I'll buy you a new
            bonnet -

                         SUSAN
                   (amused, but moved)
            If the stores are open -

                         STEVE
            And on Monday, I'll take it off and
            stroke your light brown hair and -

                         SUSAN
            And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer.
                         STEVE
                   (abruptly grinning)
            How do you think I realized I love
            you?

                         SUSAN
            I made you write a beautiful song...

                         STEVE
            No, you had me eating that Chinese
            food!...

They laugh and enjoyably; but then, as the CAMERA MOVES, we
realize that Sidney is there on the fire escape above them;
his manner is affable.

                         SIDNEY
            Can more than two enjoy this joke...
                   (to Susan)
            Hello, Susie, I didn't expect to
            find you here.

Steve says nothing.  But he obviously resents the intrusion
and finds it difficult to conceal the fact.  Sidney comes
down the fire escape towards them.

                         SIDNEY
            Where's those glossy prints you
            promised?  Tonight's the latest I
            can place them -

                         STEVE
                   (barely polite)
            Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget
            it.
                   (to Susan)
            It's cold out here, Susie.

Steve makes a move to lead Susan back inside.  It is a
gesture which appears to dismiss Sidney.  Sidney chooses to
take umbrage:

                         SIDNEY
                   (lightly sarcastic)
            Let me apologize for getting you
            that press spread.  It's been an
            honor to serve you gratis.

Steve turns to Sidney; his manner is quiet but challenging:

                         STEVE
                   (levelly)
            I get the feeling, Falco, that
            you're always snooping around...

                         SUSAN
                   (quickly intervening)
            Steve, stop it please...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Frank D'Angelo has followed Sidney out onto the fire escape;
other members of the Quintet have also appeared.

                         D'ANGELO
            What are you boys fighting about?

Aggressively indignant, Sidney throws up his hands; he
knocks on the metal of the fire escape.

                         SIDNEY
                   (sarcastic)
            Kill me!  Find me a door somewhere -
            I walked in without knocking!

Sidney is trying to needle Steve; Steve's temper would
normally have exploded; but now he controls it.

                         STEVE
            I'm feeling too good to fight with
            you, but that isn't what I said - I
            said you snoop.  For instance, what
            were you doing around my hotel the
            other night?

                         SIDNEY
                   (needling)
            Begging your pardon, I haven't been
            down the bowery in years!

                         D'ANGELO
                   (soothingly)
            Come on boys, break it up...

                         STEVE
                   (overriding D'Angelo)
            The next time you want information,
            Falco, don't scratch for it like a
            dog - ask for it like a man!

SIDNEY

His face tightens; he appears to be mortally insulted and
controlling himself with difficulty.  He turns his back
swiftly on Steve, addressing Susan in a voice that has a
sharp edge.

                         SIDNEY
            If you're going home, Susie, I'll
            drop you off...

Sidney starts quickly up the fire escape.  This makes Steve
angry and he steps forward to follow him.  But Chico
contrives, without seeming to interfere to obstruct Steve.

                         CHICO
                   (easily)
            Time for the next set, Chief...

                         STEVE
            Just a minute, Chico.

CORRIDOR

Sidney comes inside.  When he is out of sight or the group
in the courtyard, his manner swiftly changes.  It's obvious
now that his indignation was assumed; now he looks back
towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes;
he is assessing Steve's temper.  But, presently, seeing
D'Angelo and the boys returning, he moves back to the
curtains into the Club.

COURTYARD

As D'Angelo and the other boys go inside, Steve turns back
to Susan.

                         STEVE
                   (fondly)
            Just so you don't leave me in a
            minor key.

INT. CLUB

Rita has succeeded in recapturing Sidney near the entrance
to the club.  Sidney, alert and interested, listens to her
while keeping his eye on the bandstand in b.g. where the
intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the
quintet are returning, ready to mount the bandstand again.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't tell me you started a polka
            with Leo Bartha?

                         RITA
                   (shaking her head)
            No.  That's what I mean - I'm being
            fired for what I didn't do.

Sidney is amused.  Rita continues in a confidential manner
which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not-very-
convincing air of injury.

                         RITA
                   (soto voce)
            He came in last week on a very dull
            rainy night.  I know who he was,
            but I didn't let on.
                   (emphatically)
            He didn't take his eyes off me all
            night.  Listening...?

Rita has mistaken Sidney's shrewdly calculating expression
for inattention.

                         SIDNEY
            Avidly.  He was staring.

                         RITA
                   (continuing)
            Staring.  Consequently, when he
            approached me on his way out I
            wasn't surprised, but I didn't let
            on.

                         SIDNEY
                   (prompting)
            He was writing a special Sunday
            piece on...?

                         RITA
                   (nodding)
            ...cigarette girls... And naturally -

                         SIDNEY
            You were thrilled to be interviewed.
                   (she nods)
            Were you "interviewed"?

                         RITA
            In his apartment -

                         SIDNEY
            And where was his wife?

                         RITA
            I don't know - it's a big apartment.
            But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact,
            I was totally unprepared for what
            happened.

                         SIDNEY
                   (grimacing)
            We're old friends, Chickie - quit
            it!  A big columnist comes in this
            room, without his ball-and-chain
            and you make like a delicatessen
            counter!  What did you think would
            happen in his house?

                         RITA
                   (with a nod)
            But, Sidney darling, the man must
            be out of his mind - it was only
            eleven o'clock in the morning!

Despite himself, Sidney chuckles; but she is distressed.

                         RITA
            For a moment I was so taken aback
            that I said anything that popped
            into my sleepy head.  If I'm not
            mistaken, I even ordered the man
            out of his own house.

Sidney's eyes have been caught by something at the other end
of the big room.

STEVE AND SUSAN

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Susan has come back into the club
with Steve and seems to be taking leave of him.  She starts
to walk through the club on her way out.

RESUME SIDNEY AND RITA

Sidney, with half his attention on Susan and Steve, listens
to Rita's rueful protest.

                         RITA
                   (rapidly)
            He was furious and, by the time I
            could have put on a Tropical Island
            mood, I was out on the street!...
                   (dolefully)
            That night Mr. Van Cleve calls me
            into his office here.  He's got
            nothing against me, he says but he
            can't afford to antagonize
            columnists.  I told him I still
            have Sonny at military academy, but
            Van Cleve's made of ice...

Aware that Sidney is moving to leave her so that he can
catch Susan, Rita detains him with an appeal:

                         RITA
                   (tentative)
            Do you think you could do something,
            Sidney?

                         SIDNEY
                   (a quick nod)
            That's what I'm thinking, Rita.
            Maybe...

Rita is anxious to cement the offer.  Delicately, she asks:

                         RITA
            Do you still keep your key under
            the mat?

                         SIDNEY
                   (eyeing her)
            Can you be there by two-thirty?

She drops her eyes, nods.  Sidney pats her arm and is gone.
She looks after him.

SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Sidney overtakes Susan at the front entrance in time to open
the door for her.  He has now reverted to another mood in
which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to
him by Steve.  He goes out ahead of her.

BANDSTAND

The quintet are resuming their positions on the stand.
Steve lingers a moment, his guitar already in his hand while
he talks to D'Angelo.

                         STEVE
            Frank, I don't want any secrets
            from you.  I proposed to Susie
            tonight.

D'Angelo hides his feelings, asks:

                         D'ANGELO
            Did she accept?

                         STEVE
            You don't like it, do you.  I think
            she will accept, but I'm not sure.
            She may be too dependent on her
            brother.

He mounts the bandstand.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (solemnly)
            Lots of good people in this town
            are dependent on her brother...

Steve sits on the stool, quietly gives the beat to his group
and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and
lonely melody. (The Sage.)

ANOTHER ANGLE

While D'Angelo watches him, the boy continues.  CAMERA
tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and
babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation
of the quiet melancholy of the music.

OUTSIDE THE ELYSIAN ROOM

Susan is standing beside the poster which features Steve,
listening to the music from inside the club.  Sidney comes
to join her.  He is now pretending to be hurt.

                         SUSAN
            You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so
            touchy...

                         SIDNEY
                   (gruffly)
            I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I
            came to bring him a present.
                   (then)
            Wanna bite to eat?

Susan shakes her head.  She looks up as she hears the
doorman's whistle off screen.  Sidney moves forward to
escort her to the taxi.

LONGER SHOT

They cross the sidewalk and get into the cab.  It starts off
and CAMERA PANS with it.

INSIDE CAB

Susan is relaxed, content but thoughtful.  Sidney flicks her
a quick, anxious look.  Finally, gloomily:

                         SIDNEY
            Feels like a Monday night, don't
            it...?

                         SUSAN
                   (softly)
            Not to me.  Sometimes, the world
            feels like a cage.  Then someone
            comes along and opens the door...and
            it's never Monday night again...
                   (turning to Sidney)
            I wish you and Steve could like
            each other.

                         SIDNEY
                   (grimacing)
            We stick in each others craw.

                         SUSAN
            Yes, but why?

                         SIDNEY
            Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J.
            is some kind of monster.

SUSAN

Quizzically, she studies Sidney.

                         SUSAN
            Don't you?

SIDNEY

He looks up sharply, (he is momentarily startled at Susan's
insight.) Swiftly, he assumes a protesting air.

                         SIDNEY
            Susie, your brother's one of my
            best friends, and -

RESUME SUSAN

She is not totally convinced by this performance.  She
smiles skeptically.

                         SUSAN
            I know.  But someday I'd like to
            look into your clever mind and see
            what you REALLY think of him -

RESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Sidney makes a show of indignation.

                         SIDNEY
            Where do you come off to make a
            remark like that?

                         SUSAN
                   (quietly)
            Who could love a man who keeps
            jumping through burning hoops, like
            a trained poodle?

Sidney doesn't immediately answer.  Susan drops her eyes,
becoming absorbed in her own problems.  Cautiously, Sidney
lets the momentary silence continue.  Then:

                         SUSAN
                   (thoughtfully)
            Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?

                         SIDNEY
                   (glibly)
            Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He
            thinks he's very gifted - those
            boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.

Susan says nothing.  Sidney, watching her closely, probes
further:

                         SIDNEY
                   (gently)
            You feel pretty strong about this
            boy?

A pause.  Then Susan nods.  She is not looking at Sidney and
cannot see the watchfulness in his face.  Sidney prompts
again:

                         SIDNEY
            Wedding bells, you mean?

Again Susan nods.

                         SUSAN
            He wants me to go on the road with
            them.  It's an eight month tour,
            all the way to Oregon...

SIDNEY

The news has considerable impact on him.  But he hides it,
saying lightly:

                         SIDNEY
            Well, congratulations.  But don't
            go just for the ride!  Or didn't
            you accept the proposal?

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

Susan continues.

                         SUSAN
            I'm going to discuss it with J.J.
            in the morning.

A pause.  Each is concerned with private thoughts.  Susan,
relaxed, adds quietly:

                         SUSAN
                   (softly)
            It's given me a big lift to know
            that some people want me for
            myself, not just because I'm my
            brother's sister.

                         SIDNEY
            Chickie, I'll have to laugh at
            that - an attractive girl like
            you...!

Susan ignores his remark, continuing thoughtfully:

                         SUSAN
            I hope that J.J. really likes
            Steve, that it isn't an act.

                         SIDNEY
                   (with an indignant edge)
            Why should he put on an act?  Your
            brother has told PRESIDENTS where
            to go and what to do!

The taxi has pulled to a stop.  Susan sits for a moment
before she remarks.

                         SUSAN
            The act would be for my sake, not
            Steve's...

Realizing that they have come to their destination, Susan
gets up, moving out of CAMERA as she disembarks from the
taxi.  CAMERA catches a glimpse of apprehension in Sidney's
eyes.  Quickly, he decides to follow her.

EXT. BROADWAY

Susan, getting out of the taxi, moves past CAMERA.  Sidney,
following her, instructs the driver.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to cabbie)
            Wait for me.  I'll be right back.

LONGER SHOT

Sidney moves after the girl, calling: "Susie!"

SUSAN

Hearing him, Susan turns back.  Sidney walks into shot to
join her.

                         SIDNEY
                   (lightly)
            It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll
            talk to you like an uncle...

                         SUSAN
                   (smiling)
            But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.

They move through the doors.

REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney quickly corrects himself, saying earnestly:

                         SIDNEY
            No, I mean because I admire you -
            in fact, more than admire you -
            although that's neither here nor
            there.
                   (quickly skipping to
                   the important point)
            Susie, don't sell your brother
            short.  Talk this over with him, I
            mean - you'll find him a real friend.

SUSAN

Susan looks thoughtful, making no comment.

RESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Carefully (again probing) he prompts her:

                         SIDNEY
            Any message, in case I see J.J.
            later?

Susan turns away and walks out past CAMERA.  Sidney watches
her.

SUSAN

She looks back at Sidney, quietly firm.

                         SUSAN
            Yes.  Tell him for me that Steve
            Dallas is the first real man I've
            ever been in love with...

She turns away and walks through the inner door, going down
the corridor towards the elevators in background.

RESUME SIDNEY

The sincerity of the girl's manner strikes home to Sidney.
Now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain
with which he hears the statement of her feelings for
another man.  Angered, he wheels, striding out of the door
onto Broadway.

EXT. BROADWAY

Sidney returns to the cab, instructing the driver:

                         SIDNEY
            The Twenty One Club.

He climbs in and the taxi drives off down Broadway.

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA HIGH, SHOOTING WEST down 52nd Street, as Sidney's cab
pulls up, double parking in front of the 21 Club.  Sidney
maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the
entrance and the CAMERA DESCENDS to SHOOT ALONG the courtyard
towards the entrance.  We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and
his girl friend coming out of the Club.

CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT

Jimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a
girl; he is slightly tight.  As he steps through the outer
doors, Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk; he steps
to one side of the entrance way.

Sidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to
enter the Club, Weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing
him, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard.  Sidney is
instantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust
himself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon.

                         SIDNEY
            Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I
            am just going -

                         WELDON
                   (overlapping)
            Yeah.  A coincidence you should run
            into the very man you've been
            ducking all week!
                   (to the girl)
            This is my press agent, Joan.

Weldon, jibing at Sidney, plays his remarks off the girl,
who is amused; Sidney, of course, is not.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            I tried to reach you twice -

                         WELDON
                   (overlapping)
            What do you do for that hundred a
            week.  Fall out of bed?

                         SIDNEY
            Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right
            now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can
            promise you -

                         WELDON
                   (horsing)
            Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest
            this kid for larceny!

Sidney flinches, his pride touched.

                         SIDNEY
            Listen, when your band was playing
            at Roseland -

                         WELDON
                   (cutting in)
            That was two months ago.  Take your
            hand out of my pocket, thief!

The girl tries to quiet Weldon, who has gone from horsing to
loud contempt.

                         THE GIRL
            Take it easy, Jimmy dear...

                         WELDON
                   (indignantly)
            Why?  It's a dirty job, but I pay
            clean money for it, don't I?

Abruptly Sidney bursts out, giving as good as he has taken:

                         SIDNEY
            No more you don't!  What is this -
            You're showing off for her?  They're
            supposed to hear you in Korea?

                         WELDON
                   (smirking to the girl)
            He's intuitive - he knows he's
            getting fired!

                         SIDNEY
            If you're funny, James, I'm a
            pretzel!  Drop dead!

Weldon, shepherded by the girl, is already on his way across
the sidewalk.

                         WELDON
            It was nice knowing you, Sidney.
            Not cheap - but nice.  Happy
            unemployment insurance.

INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT

Sidney, entering the Club, threads his way through the
crowded foyer, coming up to CAMERA near the foot of the
staircase.  There he meets a Captain who turns to him.

                         CAPTAIN
            How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?

                         SIDNEY
                   (nodding towards the restaurant)
            Is "he" inside?

                         CAPTAIN
            But of course...

                         SIDNEY
            Alone or surrounded?

                         CAPTAIN
            A Senator, an Agent and Something -
            With - Long - Red - Hair.

Sidney moves past CAMERA, coming a couple of paces towards
the door to the restaurant.  He pauses.

REVERSE ANGLE

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Shooting through the doorway into
the restaurant, we can see the group at the table.
(Hunsecker's back is turned to us.) CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Sidney in foreground.  He decides not to go into
restaurant and turns away out of shot.

INT. LOUNGE

Sidney comes round the corner from the foyer and walks
through the lounge to the door into the alcove where the
phone booths are, CAMERA PANNING.

PHONE BOOTHS

Sidney moves briskly past the girl at the switchboard,
instructing her:

                         SIDNEY
            Honey, get me Mr. Hunsecker.

The girl reaches for a book of phone numbers, then remembers:

                         OPERATOR
            He's right inside, Mr. Falco.

                         SIDNEY
                   (from inside the booth)
            So it isn't Long Distance.

As the girl, shrugging, puts through the call, CAMERA moves
closer to Sidney in the booth.  He hears the connection
made, speaks at once.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            J.J.?  It's me --

We are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a
voice on the other end.  Though the words are not
distinguishable, it is quite clear that the speaker is not
talking to the phone.  Sidney seems to relax, as if this is
something that happens often.  He waits, studying his
manicured fingertips...

Presently Sidney hears the voice on the other end become
clearer.  It asks: "Yes?" CAMERA moves closer as Sidney says:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., it's Sidney.  Can you come
            outside for one minute?

Hunsecker's voice, filtered through the sound of the
telephone, is sharp and tiny; but the words are now very
clear.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            Can I come out?  No.

                         SIDNEY
                   (tensely)
            I have to talk to you, alone, J.J.,
            that's why.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            You had something to do for me -
            you didn't do it.

                         SIDNEY
            Can I come in for a minute?

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            No.  You're dead, son - get yourself
            buried!

There is a click as Hunsecker hangs up.  Sidney, more
slowly, also hangs up.  Brooding, he comes out of the booth.

INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - LOUNGE

Sidney comes out of the door to the phone booths, walks
through the lounge to the hallway.  He turns towards the
dining room.

INT. HALLWAY

Sidney comes to the door into the dining room, CAMERA
tracking with him.  Here he pauses, looking towards...

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Hunsecker is seated at a table
which is cleverly his habitual position.  We see him only in
semi-back view, a broad and powerful back.  He is listening
to a man who has paused at his table, stooping over Hunsecker
to whisper in his ear.  As the columnist listens, his hands
play with an omni-present pad and pencil which lie on the
dinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes, mimeographed
sheets and a telephone.  Beyond Hunsecker and the man
talking to him are the SENATOR, the AGENT, and an attractive,
if fatuous GIRL.

                         HUNSECKER
            I'll check it in the morning, Low -
            thanks.

The man leaves; Hunsecker is scribbling a note on the pad.
Meanwhile the Senator whispers something to the girl, who
giggles softly.

REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney comes across to the table, nervous but deliberate.
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker in foreground.
Sidney, without accosting him, stands a few feet from the
columnist's elbow and deliberately lights a cigarette.
Hunsecker, barely turning his head, sees him.  We have heard
of Hunsecker as a monster, but he is evidently in a mild
phase of his metabolism, for he seems gentle, sad and quiet,
as he turns his gaze casually to the Senator, totally
ignoring the young man who stands behind him.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (softly)
            Harvey, I often wish I were dead
            and wore a hearing aid...with a
            simple flick of a switch I could
            shut out the greedy murmur of
            little men...

SIDNEY

A close shot.  Sidney shows no reaction to this insult.  He
steps in closer, an Indian fixity in his face.

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., I need your ear for two
            minutes...

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting across Sidney, onto Hunsecker.  J.J. turns - but
not to Sidney.  He raises his hand in a small gesture which
summons a passing Captain, who steps into picture at Sidney's
elbow.

                         HUNSECKER
            Mac!  I don't want this man at my
            table...

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly but quietly interrupting)
            I have a message from your sister.

The Captain is already there.  But now Hunsecker's eyes have
switched to Sidney's face.  For the briefest of moments,
nothing happens.  Then Hunsecker, seeming to relax and
ignoring the Captain whom he has summoned, turns back to
casual conversation with the Senator as if nothing had
happened.

                         HUNSECKER
            Forgive me, Harvey.  We were
            interrupted before -

In foreground, Sidney turns to the Captain with a carved
smile, indicating that Hunsecker's change of topic is to be
interpreted as sanction for Sidney to remain.  The Captain,
not entirely convinced, retreats.  Sidney finds himself a
chair, places it and takes a seat which is near enough to
the table to establish his presence.  During this:

                         SENATOR
                   (who is mildly
                   surprised and faintly embarrassed)
            Err...the Supreme Court story, I
            was telling you - Justice Black.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (nodding)
            Yes, the Justice, that's right.
            But I think you had it in the column.

                         SIDNEY
                   (smoothly, casually)
            Last July, the lead item...

Sidney's interjection is quietly well-mannered.  Hunsecker
totally ignores it.  The other members of the party are a
little astonished at the interplay.  The girl, in particular,
is fascinated; she clearly admires Sidney's looks.  The
Senator, noting this, glances at Sidney, accepting the point:

                         SENATOR
                   (laughing)
            And I believe that's precisely
            where I read it, too.  You see,
            J.J., where I get my reputation for
            being the best-informed man in
            Washington.

                         HUNSECKER
            Now don't kid a kidder.

THE SENATOR, THE GIRL, AND THE AGENT

The girl looks again towards Sidney.  The Senator again sees
this, addresses Sidney pleasantly.

                         SENATOR
            I don't think we caught your name,
            young man.

REVERSE ANGLE

Group shot.  The Senator in foreground, Sidney beyond
Hunsecker in background, and the others on edge of shot.

                         SIDNEY
            Sidney Falco, sir.  And, of course,
            everyone knows and admires you,
            Senator Walker.

                         SENATOR
                   (humorously)
            Every four years I get less
            convinced of that.  This young lady
            is Miss Linda James.
                   (indicates the Girl)
            She's managed by Manny Davis.
                   (he indicates the Agent)


SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney nods pleasantly to the Girl and the Agent.

                         SIDNEY
            I know Manny Davis.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Everyone knows Manny Davis...
                   (as the phone rings
                   on the table)
            ...except MRS. Manny Davis.

Hunsecker is picking up the phone, continuing:

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes?  Go ahead, Billy - shoot...

REVERSE ANGLE

To intercut with the above.  The Senator, the Agent and the
Girl watching Hunsecker.  The Agent's reaction to Hunsecker's
remark is a sickly smile.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He repeats aloud a story which is told him over the telephone.

                         HUNSECKER
            Uh huh.  Sports cars in California
            are getting smaller and
            smaller...the other day you were
            crossing Hollywood Boulevard and
            you were hit by one...you had to go
            to the hospital and have it
            removed...
                   (coolly)
            You're not following the column: I
            had it last week.

During the speech, CAMERA eases back to include Sidney again.
At the end, Sidney looks up in the direction of the Senator.

                         SIDNEY
            Do you believe in capital
            punishment, Senator?

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

The Senator, amused, asks:

                         SENATOR
            Why?

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Sidney glances sidelong at Hunsecker.

                         SIDNEY
                   (pointing to the phone)
            A man has just been sentenced to
            death...

Hunsecker's face hardens; aware of Sidney's impertinence, he
does not design to react directly; he turns towards the Agent.

                         HUNSECKER
            Manny, what exactly are the UNSEEN
            gifts of this lovely young thing
            that you manage...?

THE AGENT AND THE GIRL

The Agent glances uneasily at the Girl beside him.

                         AGENT
            Well, she sings a little...you
            know, sings...

                         GIRL
                   (by rote)
            Manny's faith in me is simply awe-
            inspiring, Mr. Hunsecker.  Actually,
            I'm still studying, but -

RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies the Girl intently.

                         HUNSECKER
            What subject?

RESUME THE AGENT AND THE GIRL

                         GIRL
            Singing, of course...straight
            concert and -

RESUME HUNSECKER

Hunsecker's glance flicks between the Girl and the Senator.

                         HUNSECKER
            Why "of course"?  It might, for
            instance, be politics...

As the Girl betrays herself with a nervous glance at the
Senator beside her, CAMERA eases back to include him.  The
Senator is unruffled; gravely, he lights a cigar.  The Girl
laughs.

                         GIRL
            Me?  I mean "I"?  Are you kidding,
            Mr. Hunsecker?  With my Jersey City
            brains?

RESUME HUNSECKER

Again his glance links the Girl and the Senator.

                         HUNSECKER
            The brains may be Jersey City, but
            the clothes are Trainor-Norell.

THE SENATOR, THE AGENT AND THE GIRL

The Girl and the Agent are both nervously uneasy.  The
Senator closely examines the tip of his cigar and, with
deliberation, turns towards Sidney.

                         SENATOR
            Are you an actor, Mr. Falco?

                         GIRL
                   (supporting the
                   change of subject)
            That's what I was thinking.  Are
            you, Mr. Falco?

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Hunsecker, for the first time, half-turns in Sidney's
direction, amused.

                         HUNSECKER
            How did you guess it, Miss James?

RESUME THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

They all look at Sidney.

                         GIRL
            He's so pretty, that's how.

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney bitterly resents the adjective, but contrives to hide
the fact; he smiles, gracefully accepting the compliment.
Hunsecker (who knows what Sidney feels) is pleased; he turns
towards Sidney expansively.

                         HUNSECKER
            Mr. Falco, let it be said at once,
            is a man of FORTY faces, not one,
            none too pretty and ALL deceptive.
            See that grin?  It's the charming
            street urchin's face.  It's part of
            his "helpless" act - he throws
            himself on your mercy.  I skip the
            pleading nervous bit that sometimes
            blends over into bluster.  The
            moist grateful eye is a favorite
            face with him - it frequently ties
            in with the act of boyish candor:
            he's talking straight from the
            heart, get it?  He's got about
            half-a-dozen faces for the ladies,
            but the real cut one to me is the
            quick dependable chap - nothing he
            won't do for you in a pinch.  At
            least, so he says!  Tonight Mr.
            Falco, whom I did not invite to sit
            at this table, is about to show in
            his last and most pitiful role:
            pale face with tongue hanging out.
            In brief, gentlemen and Jersey
            Lilly, the boy sitting with us is a
            hungry press agent and fully up to
            all the tricks of his very slimy
            trade!

Hunsecker has started his speech lightly, but it has built
up to enough cold contempt and feeling to embarrass and
intimidate the others at the table.  In conclusion,
Hunsecker, his eyes on Sidney, picks up a cigarette and
waits expectantly...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Match me, Sidney...

                         SIDNEY
                   (coolly)
            Not just this minute, J.J....

Amused, Hunsecker lights his own cigarette, turns towards a
man who comes up to the table.

HUNSECKER

A single close up, to intercut with the above.

SIDNEY

A matching single; Sidney's reaction to Hunsecker and to the
others at the table.

THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

To intercut with the above; their reactions of embarrassment.

GROUP SHOT

A florid MAN comes up to the table, obviously anxious to
catch Hunsecker's attention.  Hunsecker, in the act of
lighting, his own cigarette, scarcely looks at the man as he
dismisses him:

                         HUNSECKER
            I know - that loafer of yours opens
            at the Latin Quarter next week.
                   (more sharply)
            Say goodbye, Lester!

The florid man retreats.  To cover the embarrassment, the
Senator makes a sally in Sidney's direction.

                         SENATOR
            May I ask a naive question, Mr.
            Falco?  Exactly how does a press
            agent work...?

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney doesn't answer.

                         HUNSECKER
            Why don't you answer the man,
            Sidalee?  He's trying to take you
            off the hook.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to the Senator)
            You just had a good example of it.
            A press agent eats a columnists
            dirt and is expected to call it
            manna.

RESUME THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

                         GIRL
            What's manna?

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker glances spitefully at the Girl.

                         HUNSECKER
            Heaven dust.

RESUME THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

The Senator continues to Sidney:

                         SENATOR
            But don't you help columnists by
            furnishing them with items?

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney leans forward, indicating to the Senator some of the
items of paper that litter the table in front of Hunsecker;
these are both handwritten notes and mimeograph sheets,
scraps of assorted items from professional and amateur
agents who supply the columnist.  Sidney fingers some of them.

                         SIDNEY
            Sure, columnists can't get along
            without us.  Only our good and
            great friend, J.J., forgets to
            mention that.  We furnish him with
            items -

Sidney lifts a mimeographed sheet, as an example.

                         HUNSECKER
            What, some cheap, gruesome gags?

                         SIDNEY
                   (to Hunsecker now)
            You print them, don't you?

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes, with your clients' names
            attached.  That's the only reason
            those poor slobs pay you - to see
            their names in my column all over
            the world!  Now, as I make it out,
            you're doing ME a favor!

                         SIDNEY
            I didn't say that, J.J.

                         HUNSECKER
            The day that I can't get along
            without press agents' handouts,
            I'll close up shop, lock, stock and
            barrel and move to Alaska.

THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

The Agent makes the mistake of trying to agree with Hunsecker.

                         AGENT
                   (nodding)
            Sweep out my igloo, here I come.

CAMERA pulls back as Hunsecker leans forward across the
table.  He vents upon the unfortunate Agent some of the
annoyance prompted by Sidney's impertinence.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to the Agent)
            Look, Manny, you rode in here on
            the Senator's shirt tails, so shut
            your mouth!

The Senator doesn't like this treatment of others and his
manner and face show it.

                         SENATOR
                   (slowly)
            Now, come, J.J., that's a little
            too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game
            for you tonight.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (not as harsh, but -)
            This man is not for you, Harvey,
            and you shouldn't be seen with him
            in public.  Because that's another
            part of a press agents life - he
            digs up scandal among prominent men
            and shovels it thin among the
            columnists who give him space.

SENATOR

He finds Hunsecker's manner disturbing, but addresses him
frontally.

                         SENATOR
            There is some allusion here that
            escapes me...

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
                   (an edge of threat)
            We're friends, Harvey - we go as
            far back as when you were a fresh
            kid Congressman, don't we?

RESUME SENATOR

                         SENATOR
            Why does everything you say sound
            like a threat?

RESUME HUNSECKER

He leans back, speaking more quietly, enjoying himself.

                         HUNSECKER
            Maybe it's a mannerism - because I
            don't threaten friends, Harvey.
            But why furnish your enemies with
            ammunition?  You're a family man.
            Someday, with God willing, you may
            wanna be President.  Now here you
            are, Harvey, out in the open where
            any hep person knows that this one...

AGENT

Hunsecker leans into shot pointing directly at the Agent.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...is toting THAT one...

Hunsecker points to the Girl and the CAMERA makes a slight
crab movement to include the Girl as Hunsecker points in
turn to her.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...around for you...

Another CAMERA movement.  Now Hunsecker is directly
challenging the Senator.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He smiles disarmingly.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...Are we kids or what?...

Hunsecker rises.

GROUP SHOT

As Hunsecker stands up, Sidney follows suit.  The Agent,
very nervous, gets to his feet and the Girl does likewise.
The Senator, whose face is sober, also rises from the table.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to the Senator, affably)
            Next time you come up, you might
            join me at my TV show.

With Sidney making way for him, Hunsecker walks round the
end of the table to the Senator.  The Senator faces Hunsecker
solemnly.

                         SENATOR
                   (quietly and cautiously)
            Thank you, J.J., for what I consider
            sound advice.

Hunsecker matches the Senator's solemnity.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (deadpan)
            Go, Thou, and sin no more.

Hunsecker moves out of shot.  Sidney murmurs a "pleased to
meet you" to the Senator; then he follows Hunsecker.  The
Senator remains looking after Hunsecker.  Behind him, the
Agent and the Girl, watch him apprehensively.  The Senator,
his face now showing the traces of guilt which he did not
reveal to Hunsecker, seems unwilling to turn back to face
them.

ON THE WAY TO THE FOYER

Hunsecker and Sidney.  Hunsecker addresses the Captain on
his way out of the restaurant.

                         HUNSECKER
            Mac, don't let the Senator pay that
            check...

                         CAPTAIN
            I'll take care of it, Mr. Hunsecker.

CAMERA tracks with Hunsecker and Sidney as they move out
towards the hat check stand.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (murmuring)
            President!  My big toe would make a
            better President!

By now they are at the coatroom, Hunsecker smiling.

                         ATTENDANT
            Mr. Hunsecker's coat, Joe.

                         HUNSECKER
            Find me a good one, Joe.

He accepts the proferred coat as he moves past CAMERA.

LONGER SHOT - NIGHT

The Doorman on the sidewalk has noticed Hunsecker, almost
before the columnist has appeared.  The Doorman wheels,
snapping his fingers and signaling towards the car park
attendant, who can be seen at some distance in the background
under the lights of the Kinney Car Park.  The attendant is
seen to react with alacrity, running into the Park.

HUNSECKER

Putting on his overcoat, he addresses another of the Captains
who has escorted him out of the Club.

                         HUNSECKER
            Dan, anyone calls, tell 'em I'll be
            at the Morocco, maybe the Embers.

                         DAN
            Very good, Mr. Hunsecker.

Sidney catches up with Hunsecker as he moves out onto the
sidewalk.

                         HUNSECKER
            Where's your coat, Sidalee?  Saving
            tips?

Sidney thinks of an impertinent reply, decides not to be
drawn and says nothing.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Sidney)
            My curiosity is killing me; what
            are you so rambunctious about
            tonight?

Sidney again does not answer; this time he points across the
street...

                         SIDNEY
            There's your fat friend.

LONGER SHOT - POLICE CAR - NIGHT

The car is framed in foreground; We can read the sign POLICE
attached to the visor.  Two men in plain-clothes, detectives,
are in the front seats.  The man nearest is HARRY KELLO.
Wanting to look like a prosperous business man, Kello looks
soft, fat, mild and well-barbered; but he is dangerous; he
knows it and enjoys it.  With "big shots" he is playful and
kidding, always says just enough, not too much.  He is very
relaxed, and mild in manner, but underneath there is not
only an animal energy, but a feral pressing at you.  His
voice is on the hoarse side.  He measures situations
automatically and instantly.

The police radio is chattering.  Also in evidence is the
telephone, the radio link with headquarters.  The detective
at the wheel nudges Kello, pointing across the street.
Kello gets out of the car and moves to meet the columnist.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (as he approaches)
            Hello, Harry.

                         KELLO
                   (cheerfully)
            Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?

Sidney follows a couple of paces behind Hunsecker; he is in
no hurry to meet the detective, whom he clearly dislikes.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (turning to Sidney)
            You see, Sidalee, that shows that
            Lt. Kello likes your people.

REVERSE ON KELLO

Kello offers his hand to Hunsecker.

                         KELLO
            It's my Brooklyn background, J.J.
            I'm good on Yiddish, too.

Hunsecker accepting the handshake, winces with pretended
pain at what is clearly an over-enthusiastic grip.

                         HUNSECKER
            Harry, am I supposed to say "uncle"?

Kello laughs, releases the grip; Hunsecker strolls past him
stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on
the radio.

                         HUNSECKER
            Anything fit to print, tonight?
                   (to the policeman in
                   the car)
            Hello, Phil.  How're the kids.

The detective inside the car answers, respectfully.

                         PHIL
            Fine, Mr. Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER
            Any news fit to print tonight?

                         KELLO
                   (joining Hunsecker)
            I just checked "downtown".  Quiet
            everywhere tonight.

                         HUNSECKER
            Incidentally, what happened to that
            doll? - You gave me the item last
            night.  Still alive?

                         KELLO
            Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging
            on.  But they still don't know if
            she was pushed.

                         HUNSECKER
            She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?
                   (to the policeman in
                   the car)
            Check it for me, Phil...it's a real
            heart throb.

While Phil lifts the radio phone, calling headquarters,
Hunsecker turns back to Kello and Sidney.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mischievously, Hunsecker nods at Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Kello)
            Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle
            him - he's been a bad boy tonight.
            He called you my fat friend.

                         KELLO
                   (mildly)
            I don't believe it.

Instantly aware that J.J. is toying with Sidney, Kello
offers his large hand to Sidney, who refuses it.

                         SIDNEY
            I know...I know you're the strongest
            cop in town.

                         KELLO
                   (with a laugh)
            I call him the boy with the ice
            cream face!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (laughing)
            Say, that's good - it's nice - in
            fact, it's APT, Harry!

                         KELLO
                   (modestly)
            Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things
            together.

                         HUNSECKER
            I remember ONCE when you didn't
            quite "put things together".  Boy!
            Was the Mayor mad!

The memory of something unpleasant clouds Kello's face.

                         KELLO
            Citizens committees!  I didn't mean
            to hit the boy that hard.  Yeah,
            that's when a feller needed a
            friend and I won't forget his
            initials, J.J.

The policeman in the car sticks his head out of the window.

                         PHIL
                   (to Hunsecker)
            She died twenty minutes ago, Mr.
            Hunsecker.  They're still
            investigating.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (shaking his head
                   with total dismissal)
            That's show business.  Thanks, Phil.
                   (to Kello)
            See you.

ANOTHER ANGLE - 52ND STREET - NIGHT

Kello gets into the police car.

                         KELLO
                   (as he does so)
            Hasta La Vista, J.J.  Hasta Luego.

ANOTHER ANGLE - 52ND ST. - NIGHT

The car moves off eastward.  Sidney and Hunsecker walk
westward.  Sidney, falling into step with Hunsecker, glances
back at the departing police car.

                         SIDNEY
            Spahish...that must show he likes
            "spigs", too.

                         HUNSECKER
            I like Harry, but I can't deny he
            sweats a little.

CAMERA now SHOOTS down 52nd Street.  Hunsecker, back to
CAMERA, studies the evening, hearing the sound of a screech
of female laughter from one of the groups in the distance.
A drunk is being thrown out of one of the strip tease joints.

                         HUNSECKER
            I love this dirty town.

Amused, Hunsecker turns back; he signals across the street
to the car park, indicating that the big black Lincoln
Continental should follow as he strolls with Sidney.

HUNSECKER.  SIDNEY FOLLOWING.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (after a pause)
            Conjugate me a verb, Sidney.  For
            instance, TO PROMISE!

CAMERA TRACKS with them in a CLOSE TWO SHOT.  Sidney is
alert now.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            You told me you'd break up that
            romance - when?

                         SIDNEY
                   (hesitantly)
            You want something done, J.J., but
            I doubt if you yourself know what's
            involved.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (soft and sardonic)
            I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.

                         SIDNEY
                   (carefully)
            Why not break it up yourself?  You
            could do it in two minutes flat.

Hunsecker pauses, halts.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (harshly)
            At this late date you need
            explanations...?  Susie's all I
            got - now that she's growing up, I
            want my relationship with her to
            stay at least at par!  I don't
            intend to antagonize her if I don't
            have to.
                   (starting to walk again)
            Now, be warned, son - I'll have to
            blitz you...

Sidney follows quickly.

                         SIDNEY
            Frankly, J.J., I don't think you
            got the cards to blitz me.

                         HUNSECKER
            I don't?

                         SIDNEY
            Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
            don't think so...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (turning to eye him)
            I'll listen one more minute.

Sidney steps in front of Hunsecker, blocking his way for a
moment.

                         SIDNEY
                   (very rapidly)
            About a year ago, you asked me to
            do a favor.  It was a thing - well,
            I never did a thing that dirty in
            all my life.

Hunsecker, totally disinterested in Sidney's problems of
conscience, signals to his car again, walks past Sidney, who
continues rapidly:

                         SIDNEY
            Awright, that brings us up to five
            weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty
            little problem here." Did I say no?
            I'm frank to admit - it don't jell
            as fast as we like... But all of a
            sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE
            NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of
            this date, am I frozen out of the
            column...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (scornfully)
            Are you finished?

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE
            THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on
            matinee days - otherwise he's got a
            head.  And Susan, like you said,
            she's growing up.  Two heads.
            What I mean, we got a slippery,
            dangerous problem here!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (incisively)
            Not "we", Sidney, you!

                         SIDNEY
                   (gamely)
            Correct me if I'm wrong - WE!
            Because when I'm out on this very
            slippery limb for you, you have to
            know what's involved.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (sardonically)
            Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my
            left hand for thirty years!

Sidney quickly moves into J.J.'s path, desperate to hold his
attention.

                         SIDNEY
            I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me
            wrong - in for a penny, in for a
            pound.  I'll see it through, but
            stop beating me around the head.
            Let me make a living!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (his mouth tight and mean)
            What you promised - do it!  Don't
            finagle around.  It's later than
            you think.

Hunsecker walks past Sidney, now making for the car at which
the attendant still waits.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as Hunsecker passes him)
            Excuse it, but it's later than you
            think.  That boy proposed tonight.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker is HIT: he stops in his stride; he pauses and he
turns slowly to look at Sidney.  Lowering, he hesitates,
mind clicking...

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie told you that...?

REVERSE ANGLE - FAVORING SIDNEY

Sidney, his eyes bright, nods.  Hunsecker studies Sidney,
then:

                         HUNSECKER
            No wonder you've been so 'feisty'
            tonight.

A pause.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Can you deliver?

Sidney nods.

                         SIDNEY
            Uh huh.

                         HUNSECKER
            When?

                         SIDNEY
            Tonight.  Before you go to bed.
            The cat is in the bag and the bag
            is in the river.

HUNSECKER

Expressionless, he examines Sidney.  Then he walks off
toward the car.  He tips the attendant, who thanks him, but
instead of getting into the back of the car, he makes a
small authoritative gesture to Nikko (double) to move over
so that Hunsecker himself may drive.  While Nikko does so,
Hunsecker turns back to Sidney, whom the CAMERA now includes.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            Don't be a two time loser, Sidalee.
            The sentence could be severe...

SIDNEY

He is satisfied.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker gets into the driver's seat beside Nikko, the
Japanese houseboy.  CAMERA is CLOSE on Hunsecker who does
not look back but is clearly aware of the position of Sidney
as he puts the car into gear, revving the engine...

SIDNEY - NIGHT

The big car accelerates with impressive power.  In doing so,
it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in Sidney's
direction.  He leaps out of the way, too late.  CAMERA MOVES
closer to him as, with anger and ignominy he inspects his
precious clothing for damage.  But, as he looks after the
car, his face hardens into grim humor; he senses that this
petty gesture from Hunsecker is an indication of his
vulnerability, not his strength.  As, dusting his coat,
Sidney walks away, CAMERA RISES, watching his jaunty figure
cross the street in the direction of 51st Street.

                                      QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TOOTS SHOR'S RESTAURANT

A LONG SHOT looking over the round bar towards the entrance.
Sidney comes in through the revolving doors and comes toward
CAMERA.  His eyes search among the crowd.

CLOSER ANGLE

REVERSE ANGLE.  A CAPTAIN approaches Sidney.

                         CAPTAIN
            Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?

                         SIDNEY
                   (shaking his head)
            Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha
            been in?

                         CAPTAIN
            Yeah, having supper with the Mrs.
            She's over there.

The Captain nods towards a booth on the other side of the
bar where Mrs. Bartha is sitting alone.  Seeing that Bartha
is not with her, the Captain looks around the bar...

                         CAPTAIN
            He's somewhere...

                         SIDNEY
                   (interrupting)
            Thanks, I see him...

Sidney is looking back towards the entrance hall, where...

BARTHA

Bartha comes forward (from the Men's Room) passing the
Captain and Sidney.  Sidney moves to intercept him.

                         SIDNEY
            Hello, Leo.  How goes that Sunday
            piece on cigarette girls?

ANOTHER ANGLE

A CLOSE SHOT on Bartha as he turns towards Sidney, stopping.

                         BARTHA
                   (cautiously)
            Who told you about it?

SIDNEY

Sidney smiles at Bartha, but the threat is clear.

                         SIDNEY
            The cigarettes girl...Rita.  And
            she took out all her hairpins, too.

RESUME BARTHA

He throws a quick glance at his wife in the booth in
background.  CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney, who has noted the
look, moves closer to Bartha.

                         SIDNEY
            I never had the pleasure of meeting
            your wife.  You know what I wonder,
            Leo?  Could you use a hot little
            item for tomorrow's column?

Sidney is pulling out of his pocket a pad on which to
scribble the item.  But Bartha faces him squarely, speaking
sotto voce but with emphasis:

                         BARTHA
            What is this, blackmail?  Beat it!

Bartha turns on his heel and turns to walk towards his wife
beyond.

SIDNEY

Sidney's face tightens.  After a pause, he makes a decision
and walks towards the booth.

BARTHA AND HIS WIFE

Bartha's wife is reading a tabloid and sipping champagne
while her husband resumes eating a sandwich.  These two are
antagonists in a long war.  Sidney comes up to the table,
repeats:

                         SIDNEY
            Leo, I've never had the pleasure of
            meeting your wife...

Bartha looks up.  What can he do?  Begrudgingly:

                         BARTHA
            Loretta...Sidney Falco...

                         WIFE
                   (chatty)
            How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you
            know anything about horses, sit a
            minute.  Help yourself to a glass
            of this N.Y. State champagne -
            that's what my husband buys me.

Mrs. Bartha pushes the champagne bottle in Sidney's direction
as Sidney sits pleasantly; Bartha concentrates on his
sandwich.

                         SIDNEY
            All the imported wines aren't what
            they're cracked up to be.

                         WIFE
            Whose side are you on, Mr. Falco,
            his or mine?

                         SIDNEY
            Frankly, Mrs. Bartha, I'm a neutral
            observer for the United Nations.

WIFE

Mrs. Bartha laughs, enjoying his deftness; then:

                         WIFE
            What's your first name?

                         SIDNEY
                   (over scene)
            Sidney.

Mrs. Bartha turns to concentrate on the names in the racing
column of the tabloid.

                         WIFE
                   (searching the column)
            No horse running tomorrow by that
            name...

BARTHA, WIFE AND SIDNEY

An ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney.  Bartha glowers at his
wife, resenting the fact that she has permitted Sidney to
join them.

                         BARTHA
            You ought to stop this nonsense,
            Loretta, these two dollar bets.

                         WIFE
                   (cheerfully)
            It's compensation, Leo, for the
            marginal life we lead.
                   (to Sidney)
            Sidney, did you hear the story
            about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?

                         BARTHA
                   (sharply interrupting)
            That's right!  Tell him, so I can
            read it in Hunsecker's column first!

                         WIFE
                   (to Sidney, brightly)
            Oh, are you a spy for the other side?

                         SIDNEY
            No, I actually sat down to give Leo
            an item.

produces his pad again, begins to write on it.

                         WIFE
            Leo, he wants to give you an item -
            don't be sullen.

Bartha notes Sidney's writing.

                         BARTHA
                   (to his wife)
            Will you mind your own business!

                         WIFE
                   (calmly)
            Hitler!

She returns to her paper, ignoring them, Sidney finishes
scribbling the item.

                         SIDNEY
            Just in case you'd like to print
            it, Leo.  It's a blind - no names
            mentioned.  But for your private
            information, the guy's name is
            Dallas.

He pushes the item to Bartha, who reads it, briefly.
Meanwhile:

                         WIFE
                   (concentrating on the tabloid)
            There isn't a single name here that
            gives off vibrations...

Bartha pushes the item back towards Sidney.  Sidney glances
quickly at Bartha's stony face then, significantly, turns
towards his wife.

                         SIDNEY
            Anything there with a name like
            "cigarette girl"?

Bartha raises his head, looks squarely at Sidney with
contempt and anger.  His wife is unaware of this reaction.
Still looking at the paper, she murmurs:

                         WIFE
            MMmmmm..."cigarette girl"... No, no
            horse with a name like that...

Sidney pushes the item back towards Bartha.

WIFE

Mrs. Bartha's attention is attracted by Sidney's gesture.
She looks up, made aware of this strange by-play.

BARTHA AND SIDNEY

A CLOSE TWO SHOT.  Sidney waits; Bartha is white-lipped, but
pushes the item back again:

                         BARTHA
            I don't print blind items.

RESUME WIFE

She looks from Sidney to her husband and back.

                         WIFE
            What is this, chess or checkers...?

RESUME BARTHA, MRS. BARTHA AND SIDNEY

The THREE SHOT favoring Bartha and Sidney.  Both Sidney and
Bartha are now aware of Mrs. Bartha's curiosity.

                         SIDNEY
                   (pointedly)
            Neither does Hunsecker.
                   (fractional pause)
            He likes to use the real names...

A moment of chill silence.  Then Bartha gets to his feet,
signals for a waiter.  As Sidney rises also:

                         WIFE
            Where are we running?  What am I
            missing here?

                         BARTHA
            Waiter, the check.
                   (to wife)
            This man is trying to hold a gun to
            my head!

                         WIFE
                   (abruptly)
            That's the horse!  Shotgun -
            Shotgun in the fifth!

She quickly studies her newspaper again.  As quickly, Bartha
leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands.  In
doing so, he upsets the glass of champagne, which contains
only a few drops.

SIDNEY AND BARTHA

Bartha turns challengingly to Sidney.

                         BARTHA
                   (sternly)
            What do you want to tell my wife,
            Sidney...?

WIFE

She is brushing her lap with her napkin.

                         WIFE
                   (indignantly)
            He wants to tell me that you poured
            champagne all over my lap.

RESUME BARTHA AND SIDNEY

Bartha ignores her, again challenges Sidney.

                         BARTHA
            Go on, tell her, I'm waiting!

                         SIDNEY
                   (flustered)
            What are you talking about?  Are
            you nuts or what?

The Waiter arrives in picture beside them, puts the check on
the table and goes.  Bartha picks it up.

RESUME WIFE

Still mopping her dress with her napkin, she waits for her
husband to speak.

BARTHA

He glances unhappily at his wife.

                         BARTHA
            Lorry, I can't let this man
            blackmail me...

MRS. BARTHA, BARTHA AND SIDNEY

A THREE SHOT favoring Mrs. Bartha, her husband and Sidney in
foreground.

                         WIFE
            Blackmail...?

Sidney decides to retreat.  He turns, starts to go.  But
Bartha blocks his way, holding Sidney and explaining to the
Wife.

                         BARTHA
            He wants me to print a dirty smear
            item for keeping his mouth shut

A momentarily pause.  Then:

                         WIFE
            About what?

RESUME BARTHA

He is uneasy, ashamed of himself.

                         BARTHA
            Foolishly, Lorry, and I hope you'll
            understand... this cigarette
            girl...I was kidding around with
            her...this girl, I mean...I was
            kidding around and she took it
            seriously.  It was a case of bad
            judgment, Lorry, bad taste...and
            I'm just sorry, Lorry, that's all...

RESUME WIFE

She says nothing.

RESUME BARTHA, SIDNEY AND MRS. BARTHA

The ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney, Mrs. Bartha in
foreground.  Bartha now turns on Sidney.

                         BARTHA
            Your friend Hunsecker - you can
            tell him for me - he's a disgrace
            to his profession.  Never mind my
            bilious private life - I print a
            decent, responsible column - that's
            the way it stays!  Your man -
            there's nothing he won't print if
            it satisfies his vanity or his
            spite!  He'll use any spice to
            pepper up his daily garbage!  Tell
            him I said so and that, like
            yourself, he's got the morals of a
            guinea pig and the scruples of a
            gangster!

Sidney tries to brazen it out, sneering:

                         SIDNEY
            What do I do now?  Whistle "The
            Stars and Stripes Forever?"

Mrs. Bartha slides along the seat, reaching for her fur.

MRS. BARTHA

CAMERA PULLS BACK with her as she collects her belongings,
slides out between the tables and comes forward, passing
Sidney to her husband.

                         WIFE
                   (lightly)
            What you do now, Mr. Falco, is crow
            like a hen - you have just laid an
            egg.

She presents her fur to her husband, and turns her back,
inviting him to put it around her shoulders.

BARTHA AND WIFE

ANOTHER ANGLE, favoring Bartha.  He has not fully understood
the significance of his wife's gesture.  He studies her.
She confirms his hopes as she adds:

                         WIFE
            Leo, this is one of the cleanest
            things I've seen you do in years...

With the fur around her shoulders, she turns and takes her
husband's arm with some pride.  They walk away.  CAMERA
ERASES BACK to include Sidney.  He is angry at himself -
more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any
sense of shame at the attempt.

OTIS ELWELL

A MEDIUM LONG SHOT.  At a booth on the other side of the bar
sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes.
He has been watching the altercation with keen interest and
satisfaction.  Elwell gives some instructions to a waiter
who is serving him with drinks, pointing towards Sidney.

SIDNEY

Sidney's face shows a burning resentment.  He glances about
him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been
observed.  As he moves away, the waiter walks into shot,
addressing him.

WAITER

A waiter approaches Sidney.  He has a message.

                         WAITER
            Otis Elwell wants to see you, Sidney.

The waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar.
Sidney, his humiliation and rage still burning, looks off
towards...

OTIS ELWELL

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Elwell beckons.

SIDNEY

He comes round the circular bar.  He shows no eagerness to
join Elwell, but approaches the table.  Elwell makes a
gesture, inviting Sidney to sit.  Sidney doesn't accept it.

                         ELWELL
                   (pleasantly)
            I see Bartha gave you cold tongue
            for supper.
                   (as Sidney starts to leave)
            Hey, wait a minute!

                         SIDNEY
                   (hesitating)
            I'm late for a date with a dame.

Then, returning, he leans over the table addressing Elwell
with quiet anger.

                         SIDNEY
            Otis, if you're trying to blow this
            brawl into an item for your column -
            forget it!

REVERSE ANGLE

Across Sidney and Elwell.  Elwell is quietly enjoying
Sidney's display of hurt dignity.

                         ELWELL
                   (affably)
            How is dear old J.J. by the way?

                         SIDNEY
                   (his anger relapsing)
            Call him up and ask - he might drop
            dead with shock.

                         ELWELL
                   (lightly)
            If it were that easy, you wouldn't
            find an empty phone booth for the
            next two hours...

SIDNEY

A CLOSE SHOT.  While Elwell continues, he is not looking at
Sidney.  Elwell's expression of dislike of Hunsecker is not
overemphatic; but Sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is
very real - and this gives him a new idea.

                         ELWELL
                   (continuing over scene)
            ...Talk of a wake! - they'd club
            each other to cater the affair for
            free!

RESUME ELWELL AND SIDNEY

Elwell looks up at Sidney as he continues.

                         ELWELL
                   (happily)
            By the way, did I hear something
            about J.J. giving you the flit gun
            treatment - he shut you out of the
            column.
                   (amused)
            Why?

REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment (in
order to exploit Elwell's dislike of Hunsecker).

                         SIDNEY
            You don't know that lunatic yet?
            Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the
            gag - when you got him for a
            friend, you don't need an enemy!
                   (a pause, then:)
            That's what the fight with Bartha
            was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker
            froze me out.  So I'm eating humble
            pie this month - please print me an
            item."

                         ELWELL
                   (pleased)
            And, instead, he printed his heel
            in your face?

                         SIDNEY
                   (morose)
            I see you're full of human
            feelings...

ELWELL

He has lost interest in Sidney.

                         ELWELL
                   (with a shrug)
            Like most of the human race,
            Sidney, I'm bored.  I'd go a mile
            for a chuckle...

Elwell's voice fades: his attention has been caught by...

REVERSE ANGLE

...three people are passing the table, squeezing their way
past; a man with two very fetching young women.  Elwell's
eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed.

                         SIDNEY
                   (noting Elwell's preoccupation)
            ...and two miles for a pretty
            girl...?

ELWELL

He is unembarrassed at Sidney's all-too-accurate estimate.

                         ELWELL
                   (lightly)
            Three...even four...

Elwell turns back towards the papers on his table, a zippered
document case and some publications among which a columnist
might search for scandal; among these is a magazine of
semipornographic nature.

                         ELWELL
                   (continuing, casually)
            Then you're really washed up with
            Hunsecker...?

REVERSE ANGLE

The nature of Elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on
Sidney.  With his eyes glancing at the magazine, Sidney now
accepts the original offer to sit down.  He produces the
slip of paper that Bartha rejected, offering it as
illustration.

                         SIDNEY
            This is how much I'm washed with
            J.J....

As Elwell reads, Sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny -
apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazine
cover.

                         SIDNEY
            Look, Otis, I make no brief for my
            bilious private life, but he's got
            the morals of a guinea pig and the
            scruples of a gangster.

Elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item.

                         ELWELL
                   (dryly)
            A fine, fat dirty item.
                   (offering it back to Sidney)
            Who's it about?

But Sidney doesn't take the paper back; he explains:

                         SIDNEY
            A kid named Dallas, who runs a
            dinky jazz quintet.
                   (he leans closer)
            He keeps company with J.J.'s
            screwball sister...

ELWELL

This does get a reaction, a flicker of genuine interest.
Elwell reads the item for a second time.

SIDNEY AND ELWELL

Watching Elwell read, Sidney encourages:

                         SIDNEY
            It's a real goody if, like me, you
            wanna clobber J.J.!

Now Elwell lays the item down in front of him.  Clearly, he
is considering it.  Sidney prompts again.

                         SIDNEY
            He's got his TV tomorrow.  He'd
            read it just before rehearsals.

Elwell nods.  But he is still reluctant.

                         ELWELL
                   (cautiously)
            Mmm.  Trouble is I can't think of
            any good reason why I should print
            anything you give me.  I can't even
            think of a bad reason.

SIDNEY

Sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more.  He fingers
it in a preoccupied but significant way.

                         SIDNEY
                   (gently)
            Suppose I introduce you to a lovely
            reason, Otis.  One that's good and
            bad...and available?

ELWELL

His eyes go from the magazine to Sidney; he gets the point
alright.

                         ELWELL
            I'm not an unreasonable man...

Elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more.

SIDNEY AND ELWELL

In picking it up, Elwell clearly implies his readiness to
accept the item - on conditions.  Sidney, in his turn, gets
this point.  He turns towards the passing waiter.

                         SIDNEY
            Waiter!  The check.

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rita is in the bedroom.  She appears to have some familiarity
to the premises... She hears the doorbell.  She makes swift
adjustment to her appearance and takes a swift gulp of a
drink as she carries it through to answer the door.

SIDNEY'S OFFICE

The outer room is lit only by one of the lamps on the desk.
Rita crosses and goes to the door.  Sidney's shadow can be
seen through the frosted glass.  At the door, Rita opens it
slowly and with a seductive manner.

                         RITA
                   (coyly)
            Hi!

Sidney steps into the room.  Rita begins to close the door
prior to stepping into his embrace.  Sidney puts one arm
about her.  But now she reacts to...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Otis Elwell stands on the landing outside.  In most
gentlemanly fashion, he takes off his hat.

RITA

This new arrival gets a dismal reaction from the girl.

                         SIDNEY
                   (unembarrassed)
            Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.

                         RITA
                   (with no welcome whatsoever)
            Hello.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Elwell is not unaware of his cool reception.  He glances at
Sidney as he comes into the room.  But his manner is suave.

                         ELWELL
            Friends call me Otis - sometimes
            Tricky Otis.

                         SIDNEY
            Otis was outraged when I told him
            Van Cleve was going to fire you.
            Tell him not to pay any attention
            to anything you-know-who says about
            you-know-what.
                   (to Otis)
            Right, Otis?

                         ELWELL
            Right!

Elwell sits down on the sette, stretches his limbs, smiles
at the girl.  Rita still says nothing.  Sidney mistakes her
attitude for acquiescence.  He swallows his drink, sets it
down.

                         SIDNEY
            I thought you two could talk the
            whole thing over till I got back.

Rita looks at him sharply.

                         RITA
            Back?

                         SIDNEY
            One of those business meetings,
            honey - always coming up in the
            middle of the night.

He grins at Rita.  She doesn't respond.  Turning, she goes
swiftly through the door into the bedroom.

                         RITA
                   (sharply)
            Hold on.  You can drop me off on
            your way...

Emphasizing the asperity in her voice, she closes the door
behind her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Elwell looks at Sidney; Sidney looks at Elwell.  Elwell gets
up slowly from the settee.

                         ELWELL
                   (amused by acid)
            Consternation reigns...

Sidney is uncomfortable, not sure how Elwell is taking the
rejection.  Elwell glances at his wristwatch, lays down his
drink.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            Now, Otis...

Elwell shrugs, remarks pleasantly but with significance:

                         ELWELL
            I hate J.J. -- but not that much at
            this moment...

                         SIDNEY
            Give me a chance --

He goes into the bedroom, closing the door after him.

INT. BEDROOM

Rita is in a flurry of indignation.  Sitting on the bed, she
is fastening one high-heeled shoe.  Sidney stands glaring at
her.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't you know who that man is?

                         RITA
                   (bitingly)
            Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.

                         SIDNEY
                   (nodding with emphasis)
            Yeah!

                         RITA
                   (aggressively)
            And he's a perfect stranger to me.

                         SIDNEY
                   (explosively)
            So take five minutes!  Get
            acquainted!  He's an important
            man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!

Rita, who one shoe on, has begun to search for the other.

                         RITA
            What do you want all of a sudden -
            Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other
            shoe?

                         SIDNEY
            What kind of an act is this?

Rita jumps to her feet.  Her righteous indignation is
handicapped by the lop-sided stance caused by the lack of
one shoe.

                         RITA
            Don't you think I have any feelings?
            What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A
            tangerine that peels in a minute?

                         SIDNEY
                   (caustic)
            I beg your pardon!  I turn myself
            inside out to help you and now I'm
            a heavy.
                   (stooping swiftly as
                   he discovers her shoe)
            Here's your shoe, there's your
            coat, that's the door!

Contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her
arms.  The positive force of his manner gives the girl pause.
There is a silence.  Rita searches for words to explain the
offense to her sensibilities.

                         RITA
            Sidney...I...I don't do this sort
            of thing...

                         SIDNEY
            What sort of thing?

                         RITA
                   (emphatic)
            This sort of thing!

                         SIDNEY
                   (as emphatic)
            Listen, you need him for a favor,
            don't you!  And so do I!  I need
            his column--tonight.
                   (then)
            Didn't you ask me to do something
            about your job?  Don't you have a
            kid in Military School?

A pause.  Sidney has struck brutally home.  Rita's lower lip
trembles.

                         RITA
            You're a snake, Falco.  You're a
            louse, a real louse.

Sidney's manner becomes swiftly sympathetic - but still
urgent.

                         SIDNEY
                   (persuasively)
            Honey - he's going to help you!
            You want to lose your job?

Rita begins to waver, her moral indignation losing ground
before Sidney's reminders of her dire necessity.

                         RITA
                   (remonstrating)
            A girl needs a little romancing
            before she -

                         SIDNEY
                   (cutting in)
            Next time I'll call in a guy to
            paint silver stars on the ceiling!

                         RITA
                   (in a small voice)
            What would you think of me if -

                         SIDNEY
                   (cutting in to
                   reassure her)
            Nothing I didn't think of you before.

                         RITA
                   (dryly, with significance)
            - that's what I mean!

This attempt at humor signals to Sidney that he has brought
her round.  He comes to her, pats her in an encouraging
manner - to which she does not respond.

He turns to the door, and picks up the glasses she has set
down on the table behind it.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he opens the door)
            How many snorts does it take to put
            you in that Tropical Island Mood?

Sidney goes out.

SIDNEY'S OFFICE

Elwell overhears the last remark and as Sidney passes him,
he winks.  While Sidney pours another drink, Elwell faces
the doorway.  Rita comes into it, stands on the threshold.
She is still far from enthusiastic.

                         ELWELL
                   (an inspiration)
            Havana!  That's where we met!

Rita shakes her head morosely.  Sidney comes and puts a
stiff drink into her hand.  Elwell raises the glass toasting
the girl, encouraging her to drink.  Rita responds dimly.

                         RITA
                   (to Otis)
            Here's mud in your column!

Sidney laughs, more from relief than from the joke.

                         SIDNEY
            Blessings on thee, the both...well...
            Gotta run now.  See you two kids
            later!

                         ELWELL
                   (lightly)
            Hurry back.

At the door Sidney takes cheerful leave of them.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
            That gives you lots of leeway.

HALLWAY OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Closing the door, Sidney seems pleased with himself.  He
goes swiftly down the stairs.

INT. SIDNEY'S OFFICE

Rita remains on the threshold of the doorway between the two
rooms.  There is an uncomfortable silence.  Elwell carries
it off by coming to the girl, offering her a cigarette.  She
accepts it.  Elwell studies her, smiling affectionately.
Rita meets his eyes, avoids them again, then quietly offers
the information:

                         RITA
            Palm Springs.  Two years ago.

Elwell begins to laugh.  Whatever the memory, it seems to
amuse him vastly because he continues to laugh.

                         ELWELL
                   (delighted)
            That's right!

Rita drinks.  She adds glumly:

                         RITA
            Don't tell Sidney.

Elwell continues to laugh as we...

                                            CUT TO:

ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

Shooting east on 46th Street walks Sidney, coming out of the
entrance of his apartment, towards CAMERA.  He is pleased
with himself, satisfied with his ingenuity in dealing with
Rita and Bartha.

The streets behind him are dark and empty (it is about 3:00
in the morning).  CAMERA moves with Sidney as he steps
briskly into the orange juice stand and lifts the receiver
from the pay telephone.  There are no other customers at the
counter, but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for
the day ahead, piling up a mountain of empties some of which
fall at Sidney's feet.

EXT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA shoots up at the penthouse on the roof of the Brill
Bldg.  The Budweiser sign is extinguished, a black silhouette
against the sky.  A light burns in the window of Hunsecker's
apartment.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The ringing of the telephone is heard in the big room - an
impressively furnished apartment which has a decor indicating
that the owner thinks of himself in epic terms.

CAMERA moves to discover Hunsecker in robe and pajamas,
tapping at his typewriter.  Taking his leisurely time, he
picks up the phone and eventually answers it.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to phone)
            Yes...?  You sound happy, Sidney.
            Why should you be happy when I'm
            not?
                   (then)
            I'll see the papers when I get up.
            How do you spell Picasso, the
            French painter?
                   (languidly writes
                   down Picasso on his
                   scratch pad, answering
                   a query, dryly)
            It's an item - I hear he goes out
            with three-eyed girls.

ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

CAMERA shoots past Sidney at the phone toward Broadway,
which is now deserted.  A street-flushing truck goes by,
moving through the dead city.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            It would be nice if you mentioned
            R-O-B-A-R-D - Robard's jazz joint --
            it's his 20th anniversary.  Don't
            begrudge it to me, J.J. - I owe him
            lots of favors.
                   (glancing toward the
                   attendant to see that
                   he has not overheard)
            I think you understand, don't you,
            that the Dallas skull is badly
            dented?  Oh, real bad... starting
            today, you can play marbles with
            his eyeballs.
                   (even coquetting)
            Don't hold out on me, J.J., mention
            Robard.  R.O. -
                   (hangs up and walks
                   to street)

HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Hunsecker is writing Robard's name on his pad, but he says
into the phone:

                         HUNSECKER
            We shall see what we shall see...
                   (lazily)
            And don't ever use this apartment
            phone again; I have a nervous sister.

He cradles the phone, looks at it for a moment, switches his
eyes and then physically follows them, rising to stroll
towards the glass doors onto the terrace.  He moves out and
turns aside to look in at the adjoining window, which
belongs to Susan's bedroom.

INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CAMERA shoots across Susan in foreground; she is asleep, a
tired, helpless, sweet kid.  The figure of her brother is
seen - a dark shape on the terrace outside.  He moves away
across the terrace.

EXT. TERRACE - NIGHT

Hunsecker turns from the window.  CAMERA is close on his
brooding face.  CAMERA tracks with him as he crosses towards
the parapet.  At this height there is a wind which blows his
hair and the movement of the camera emphasizes a remarkable
vista of the New York skyline.  The buildings are now dark,
only a few of the electric signs are left on all night.
CAMERA comes to rest looking over Hunsecker's shoulder; it
tilts downward to a view of Broadway below, Duffy Square in
the distance.

HUNSECKER - NIGHT

A close-up; Hunsecker is looking down on his "kingdom".  But
there is little love in the man's face, only authoritarian
power.

EXT. FROM THE TERRACE - NIGHT

From Hunsecker's viewpoint.  The streets empty, except for
an occasional passing taxi.  The street flushing truck comes
up Broadway from Duffy Square...

                                    LAP DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

EXT. FROM THE TERRACE - DAY

The identical camera set-up.  Through the dissolve the light
changes from night to day; Broadway magically becomes a
roaring stream of traffic.

EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - DAY

In foreground a NEWS VENDOR.  Sidney comes out of the exit
of a subway, reaching for his pocket as he approaches the
news vendor who offers him a paper.

                         NEWS VENDOR
            The Globe?

                         SIDNEY
                   (shaking his head)
            Gimme The Record.

Sidney buys and opens the paper.  CAMERA MOVES closer to
shoot over his shoulder.  We see the gossip column which
bears a photograph of Otis Elwell at the top.  Smirking with
satisfaction, Sidney turns away from the CAMERA and throws
the paper into a trash basket before he disappears into the
impressive entrance of a large office building.  The sign
above the doorway reads: THE NEW YORK GLOBE.

                                          QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GLOBE BUILDING

Mary, Hunsecker's secretary, occupies a cubicle which is
separated form the rest of the newsroom by a partition.
From the big room beyond, comes the hum and chatter of a big
newspaper.  The walls of the urgent murmur of the staff of a
big newspaper.  The walls of Mary's cubicle are covered with
photographs; filing cabinets are piled high with unopened
mail; two wire service teletype machines click desultorily.
Mary is plain but attractive, past 30, a level-headed woman
with a sense of integrity.  She is on the phone just now,
bored with the insistent voice on the other end.  Beside her
an earnest young LAWYER waits with several papers in hand.

                         MARY
                   (to phone)
            I have no power to retract, Mr.
            Cummings... I'm only Mr. Hunsecker's
            secretary.  No.  Nor can I agree
            that can retraction is necessary.
            Thank you for calling.

Sidney has come through the newsroom in background.  He
pauses tactfully, seeing Mary occupied with the lawyer.

                         LAWYER
                   (huffily)
            I fail to see what's amusing about
            these papers.

                         MARY
            I'll get the boss to sign them.

                         LAWYER
                   (giving her the papers)
            They're important.

                         MARY
            You've said that six times - that's
            why I'm smiling.

As the disgruntled lawyer leaves, Sidney comes in, wearing
his most winning smile.  With a glance after the lawyer,
making sure that he is not observed, Sidney greets Mary,
assuming a brogue:

                         SIDNEY
            Hello, Mary, me darlin' and phwat
            are ye up to today?

Sidney's hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which
indicates a certain intimacy between them.

                         MARY
            That's a question I usually like to
            ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.

                         SIDNEY
            What about?

                         MARY
                   (shrugging)
            Something about a Frank D'Angelo
            trying to reach you...

Sidney reaches for the phone.  As he does so, Mary hesitates
and glances at a copy of The Record which lies on the desk
open at Otis Elwell's column.  She picks it up.

                         MARY
                   (continuing)
            Is that the man who manages Susie's
            boyfriend?

Sidney murmurs casually, "Yeah.  Why?" as he dials.  Mary
holds up the paper, indicating the item.

                         MARY
            Have you seen this?  In Otis
            Elwell's column.
                   (reads)
            "The dreamy marijuana smoke of a
            lad who heads a highbrow jazz
            quintet is giving an inelegant odor
            to that elegant East Side Club
            where he works.  That's no way for
            a card-holding Party Member to act.
            Moscow won't like, you naughty boy!"

Sidney accepts the paper from Mary, examines the item while
he talks to Sally on the phone.

                         SIDNEY
                   (into phone)
            Sally?  I got the message.  If
            D'Angelo calls again, tell him I'll
            be at the office around noon.

He hangs up, continuing to read.

                         MARY
            Could this be that boy?

                         SIDNEY
                   (casually)
            Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look
            like a reefer smoker...

He discards the paper with a show of disinterest.  Mary
picks it up again.

                         MARY
                   (looking at The
                   Record again)
            If this is true, J.J.'s going to
            hit the ceiling...

Sidney moves around behind Mary.  His eyes are fixed on a
spike which sits on Mary's desk.  On it is impaled a proof
of Hunsecker's column.  Meanwhile, he remarks:

                         SIDNEY
            Can it be news to you that J.J.'s
            ceiling needs a plaster job every
            six weeks?

INSERT

From Sidney's viewpoint, Hunsecker's column.  The shot is
just too distant for us to be able to read the print.

SIDNEY AND MARY

Sidney is looking at the column.  Mary is concentrated on
papers before her.  Without looking up, she is clearly aware
of Sidney's efforts to read the proof.

                         MARY
                   (quietly)
            Sidney, you know that J.J. doesn't
            like people to look at the column
            proof in advance...

Sidney, caught "in flagrante", laughs.

                         SIDNEY
            Mary, I'm not "people" - there's
            Falco blood, sweat and tears in
            that column.

He turns away, changing the subject (apparently).

                         SIDNEY
            How about dinner tonight?

Mary turns to study him.

                         MARY
            Bribing me again?

                         SIDNEY
                   (uncomfortable under
                   her scrutiny)
            And why should I bribe the woman
            who holds most of my heart?

Mary is thoughtful.  Without malice, in a detached sort of
way, she examines Sidney.

                         MARY
            You're a real rascal, Sidney.  I'd
            certainly dislike you if I didn't
            like you.  You're an amusing boy,
            but there isn't a drop of respect
            in you for anything alive - you're
            too immersed in the theology of
            making a fast buck.  Not that I
            don't sometimes feel that you yearn
            for something better...

Sidney finds this analysis hard to take.  Again he tries to
laugh his way out of it.

                         SIDNEY
                   (cynical)
            Mary, don't try to sell me the
            Brooklyn Bridge.  I happen to know
            it belongs to the Dodgers.

Mary, smiling, decides "to let him off the hook".  She takes
the spike and the column and passes it across to Sidney's
side of the desk, as she returns briskly to her business.

                         MARY
                   (affably)
            I don't mind you looking at the
            proof of the column in advance, as
            long as J.J. doesn't know.  But
            don't do it like a boy stealing gum
            from a slot machine.

Sidney doesn't like this; but, on the other hand, he does
want to look at the column.  After only a momentary struggle,
he picks the column off the spike and reads.

                         SIDNEY
            Who put this item in about the
            comic?
                   (reading)
            "If there's a more hilarious funny
            man around than Herbie Temple at
            the Palace, you'll have to pardon
            us for not catching the name.  We
            were too busy screaming." Does this
            Temple have a press agent?

                         MARY
            No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional
            beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's
            funny, so he gave him a plug.

He goes to the door, grinning.

                         SIDNEY
            What's your favorite ribbon to go
            around your favorite chocolates?

                         MARY
            Let's wait till Christmas - it's
            more legitimate then.

She looks after Sidney, thinks about him for a moment.  Then
she types.

EXT. PALACE THEATRE - DAY

Sidney comes down 47th Street from Broadway, making for the
stage door entrance of the Palace theatre.  He walks
confidently into the alleyway, paying no attention to the
old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs
next to the entrance.  The doorman turns, protesting:

                         DOORMAN
                   (calling out)
            Hey!

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

Sidney, without halting, looks back towards the Doorman,
addressing him with the patronizing manner of a superior.

                         SIDNEY
            Herbit Temple here yet?

                         DOORMAN
            Yeah, but you can't come in now!

                         SIDNEY
            I'm in, Sonny Boy!

He is already on his way into doorway.

INT. BACKSTAGE OF PALACE THEATRE

The movie will soon by finished and the comedian who opens
the stage show is ready and made-up in the wings.  He sits
with his agent, (AL EVANS) a small, worried, bespectacled
man, who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself.  They
converse in loud whispers, talking against the muffled and
echoing sound of the film sound track, silhouetted against
the ghostly, distorted images on the big screen seen at a
weird angle behind them.

                         EVANS
            I didn't waste words, Herbie, take
            my word.  I says, "look, Figo, I'm
            not selling you a dozen eggs, I'm
            selling you HERBIE TEMPLE", I says,
            so don't gimme your lip!

The comedian, Herbie Temple, looks up.  Sidney comes through
a fire-proof door which separates the stage from the
corridors to dressing room.  In background two chorus girls
in costume are squeezed into a telephone booth.  Sidney
joins the comedian and the agent; he smiles to the comedian,
while he addresses the agent.

                         SIDNEY
            Hiya, Al!

The agent looks from Sidney to Temple, surprised and
displeased.

                         EVANS
            Since when did you two get
            acquainted?

Sidney has clearly never met Evans; blandly he chooses to
regard the agent's remark as an introduction; he offers his
hand with generous amiability.

                         SIDNEY
            How do you do, Mr. Temple...

The comic accepts the hand doubtfully.

                         EVANS
                   (uncertain)
            Delighted.

                         SIDNEY
            I'm Sidney Falco.

                         TEMPLE
                   (still dubious)
            Yeah, delighted...

Evans stands up, warns the comic.

                         EVANS
            Watch this guy, Herbie, he's a
            press agent.

Temple's smile congeals.

                         TEMPLE
            You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!

                         SIDNEY
                   (in no way discouraged)
            Temple, I caught your act the other
            night and -

                         TEMPLE
            Did you now?  On which bounce?

                         SIDNEY
            - and I just had to drop by and
            tell you how great I thought you
            were.

                         TEMPLE
                   (dryly)
            Cheers.  What time is it, Al?

                         EVANS
            You got ten minutes.
                   (to Sidney)
            Hope you don't mind, Falco: we're
            busy and if -

Sidney stands up.

                         SIDNEY
            No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.

                         TEMPLE
                   (scowling)
            Good!  We're all off to Utica, so
            excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the-
            Portisan.

Sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor.  The
chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth.

                         SIDNEY
            But can I ask one impertinent
            question here?  With no criticism
            intended, because I know, Al, you
            earn your ten percent, how come you
            let a sock act like Herbie Temple
            tip-toe through town without a
            publicity build...?

Smiling wise, Evans shakes his head.

                         EVANS
            We're not buying it, Falco - no
            fish today.

Sidney presses, as if annoyed.

                         SIDNEY
            I'm not selling.  I'm just curious,
            that's all.

Temple turns away from Sidney, leaving him to Evans.

                         TEMPLE
            Answer the man, Al, if he asks you
            a question.  Quick, before he
            thinks up another!

Evans moves to Sidney, trying to shepherd him out the way he
came.

                         EVANS
            Mr. Temple doesn't believe in press
            agents - does that answer you
            something?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on Sidney's elbow.
Sidney doesn't like people touching him.  He reacts in
anger, as we have seen before - fixes a burning eye on Evans.

                         SIDNEY
            Take your hand off, lump!
                   (more politely, to Temple)
            No one believes in press agents,
            Temple, when they make claims they
            can't perform.  I got nothing to
            sell - I didn't come here to
            peddle - but if I tell a client
            that Hunsecker will give him space,
            it's not just talk!

Sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor.
Evans, angry, is stalled for a moment of delay action by
mention of the magic name of Hunsecker.

                         EVANS
                   (after hesitation)
            Listen, you bull artist - !

                         TEMPLE
            Let him go, Al...

SIDNEY

But Sidney has already stepped to the phone booth and is
dialing.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Hello?  Mary, let me speak to J.J.,
            please...it's Sidney Falco...

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting past Sidney in foreground onto Temple and Evans
beyond, they watch him, open-mouthed.  Sidney notes their
reaction.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Tell him it's important...

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Gloria is at her desk, bewildered as she speaks into the
phone.

                         GLORIA
            What?  Is this Sidney?...

            Sure, I'll wait...

While doing so, he glances back with disinterest at Evans
and Temple.  The comedian and the agent exchange looks.
Evans is uneasy; he comes up the steps into the corridor to
address Sidney with a deflated manner.

                         EVANS
                   (hesitant)
            Look, nobody hired you!  We didn't
            talk any deal, and -

With his hand over the mouthpiece, Sidney addresses Evans
with contempt.

                         SIDNEY
            Relax, lump!  I told you I'm not
            selling fish...

            Listen, I know it's late, J.J., but
            is it too late to add something
            important to the column?
                   (grinning)
            No, not a relative, but important...

RESUME - GLORIA IN INT. OF SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Shaking her head, Gloria places the phone down on the desk,
looks at it as it chatters away.  She considers returning to
her typing, but, worried, picks the phone up again.  Sidney's
chattering voice is barely audible: "You know Herbie Temple,
the comic...?  What about him?  He's at the Palace and he's
great.  That's what about him.  And you'd do me a big bunny
basket of a favor if you would say it in tomorrow's column.

RESUME BACKSTAGE PALACE THEATRE

Temple and Evans are now staring at Sidney with considerable
respect.

REVERSE ANGLE

The comedian and the agent in foreground, Sidney still on
the phone beyond.

                         SIDNEY
            Yeah, if you got a pencil there
            I'll suggest a word or two.
            Uh...uh...

The comedian and the agent in foreground, Sidney still on
the phone beyond.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone, continuing)
            If there's a funnier man in the
            world than Herbie Temple at the
            Palace...uh...pardon us for not
            catching the name, we were too busy
            laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.
                   (then)
            It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks.
            Probably see you at Twenty One
            tonight.  No, for supper, late.
            Right. 'Bye...

                         TEMPLE
            Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr.
            Falco.

                         SIDNEY
            See me in my office.

He turns and walks away down the corridor.  As he vanishes,
Temple starts after him.

CORRIDOR

Sidney walks off in the direction of the exit -- (not so
fast that he can't be overtaken).  Temple hurries into the
corridor and comes after him.  Evans also follows, though
not so eagerly.

                         TEMPLE
            Wait a minute.
                   (turning back to
                   encourage Evans)
            Speak to him, Al.
                   (to Sidney, apologetically)
            Al makes all my deals.

Sidney permits himself to be detained.

                         SIDNEY
                   (coolly, looking
                   toward Evans)
            I don't like a guy that's quick
            with the hands.
                   (to Temple)
            Temple, you've been three passes
            behind for twenty years.  This
            could start you off big - T.V. and
            anywhere.

Evans, not as wholly convinced as the comedian, comes up to
join them.  Temple looks at the agent.

                         TEMPLE
            And it would cost a pretty penny,
            huh?

                         SIDNEY
                   (to Evans)
            You tell him, I stutter!

                         EVANS
                   (shrewdly)
            Uh...Why don't we wait till tomorrow?

Sidney, shrugging, makes a negligent exit.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he goes)
            Wait as long as you like - you know
            where my office is.

They look after him.  Evans face is cold and suspecting, but
Temple's face contains fresh warmth.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

STAIRS OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Sidney comes briskly up the stairs.  Outside his door he
pauses, listens, hearing the murmur of voices inside.  Then
he walks in casually.

INT. SIDNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Sidney steps in, closing the door.  He pretends surprise as
he sees...

ANOTHER ANGLE

...Steve and D'Angelo waiting for him.  Sidney comes into
SHOT.  Sally remains at her desk while Steve and D'Angelo
are silent, looking at Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
                   (perkily)
            What is here, a wake?

D'Angelo rises from the couch, crossing to Sidney to hand
him a copy of the tabloid, The Record.  It is folded open at
Elwell's column.  As he passes it to Sidney, D'Angelo marks
with his thumbnail an item near the bottom of the column.
Sidney takes the paper and reads. (He reads a little too
quickly.)  Then he hands it back to D'Angelo.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve notes Sidney's too-perfunctory reading.

                         STEVE
            You read as you run, don't you?

Sidney turns on Steve, coldly:

                         SIDNEY
            It's a habit with me.  So now I'm
            briefed.  So what?

                         STEVE
                   (glancing at D'Angelo)
            Frank thinks I shouldn't have come
            here -

                         D'ANGELO
                   (a quick correction)
            Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely
            you shouldn't go around wild,
            blaming people without justification.

                         STEVE
                   (watchfully, to Sidney)
            I thought you might have a faint
            idea of how this item originated.

REVERSE ANGLE

Favoring Sidney.  He pauses.

                         SIDNEY
            Why me...?

                         STEVE
            Why not you?

                         SIDNEY
            That's your idea of logic?  I tell
            the Judge I didn't murder the man -
            the Judge says, "Why not you?"

                         STEVE
            Only two men in this town could be
            responsible for that smear - you or
            Hunsecker or both.

                         SIDNEY
                   (explosively)
            Dallas, ask your own manager - he's
            standing here like a pained
            wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell
            are enemies to the knife.  So how
            do you get him doing J.J. a favor?

                         STEVE
                   (quickly)
            It is a favor, isn't it?

                         SIDNEY
                   (as quickly)
            According to you, yeah.
                   (continuing rapidly
                   and with heat)
            Dallas, your mouth is as big as a
            basket and twice as empty!  I don't
            like you, comma, but neither do I
            go along with this column saying
            you smoke marijuana and belong with
            the Reds.  Also, since we're
            talking repulsive, J.J. won't like
            this for two cents!  Don't give me
            that look, Dallas - J.J. believes
            in fair play.  And secondly, this
            could splatter his sister with
            rotten egg by implication - your
            her boyfriend!

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney's manner is a little too vigorous. (In adopting an
aggressive tone, he is really trying to needle Steve.)
Steve, though on the verge of losing his temper, is sharp
enough to notice the point:

                         STEVE
            You're talking very fast.

                         SIDNEY
                   (expostulating)
            Well, I'll tell you what - excuse
            me for breathing, will ya?
                   (wheeling to Sally)
            How do you like it?  He comes to my
            office and -

D'ANGELO

Sensing the danger, D'Angelo moves forward soothingly
between them.

                         D'ANGELO
            Boys, this gets nobody nowhere -
            you're over excited, Steve and -

                         STEVE
                   (sharply)
            Don't apologize for me, Frank!

                         D'ANGELO
            ...excited with good reason, I
            wanted to say.
                   (to Sidney)
            Because this endangers the future
            of the whole quintet...

                         SIDNEY
                   (lightly)
            Should I cry...?

Steve, with a glare at both men, goes to the phone on
Sally's desk.  He dials.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            ...People catch on quick to such an
            item.  Van Cleve already called
            me - he's firing the quintet.

                         SIDNEY
            Then what are you doing here?  Go
            over there and fight!  If Van Cleve
            fires your boy, it gives a lie the
            ring of truth!

In background Steve speaks quietly into the phone:

                         STEVE
            I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker,
            please.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (replying to Sidney's question)
            We're on our way there now...

                         SIDNEY
                   (who has wheeled on Steve)
            What are you calling her for...?

STEVE

Sidney's reaction to the mention of Susan's name gives Steve
food for thought.  While he waits for Susan to be summoned
to the phone, he studies Sidney.

                         STEVE
                   (to Sidney)
            I'm the boyfriend, remember?  I
            hope one day she'll be my wife...
                   (into the phone, gently)
            This is Steve, Susie.  Don't be
            alarmed, Susie, but I want you to
            look at Elwell's column in The
            Record...today...No, about me...

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - SUSAN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Susan is on the phone.  Listening to what Steve says, she is
frightened - almost too frightened; it is as if, in some
curious sense, she had been expecting this blow.  It brings
an echo of an earlier tragedy.

                         SUSAN
            A smear?...What...What kind of
            smear...?  Where are you?

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Steve is on the phone in foreground, the others watching him.
In particular, Sally, who stands near Steve, is studying him
with obvious sympathy.  She looks slowly towards Sidney.

                         STEVE
                   (to the phone)
            We're on our way to the Elysian
            Room to dicker with Van Cleve -
            he's fired us already.  I'll call
            you later, dear... 'Bye!...

He hangs up quietly, looks at Sidney and walks towards the
door.

                         STEVE
            Come on, Frank.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the door closes behind Steve, Frank follows, more slowly.
As D'Angelo reaches the door, he pauses with his hand on the
doorknob and turns back to study Sidney.

SIDNEY

He feels uneasy under D'Angelo's scrutiny.  Sally, in
background, is also watching Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to D'Angelo)
            What are you looking at...?

D'ANGELO

He does not answer for a moment.  The unspoken accusation in
his look is very clear.  Then:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (quietly)
            The ugly world, Sidney...
                   (a pause)
            If I told Steve what I really
            think, he'd tear your head off...

RESUME SIDNEY

He brazens it out.

                         SIDNEY
                   (sneering)
            Tell him.

RESUME D'ANGELO

D'Angelo shakes his head.

                         D'ANGELO
            No.  I'm interested in his future.

D'Angelo goes slowly out.

RESUME SIDNEY

He hesitates before turning towards Sally (because he
realizes that this exchange with D'Angelo must have confirmed
Sally in her suspicions).

SALLY

Her face shows that Sidney is right.  Sally is deeply hurt,
disillusioned.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney turns to her, challenging.

                         SIDNEY
            What's the matter?

                         SALLY
                   (not looking at him)
            Nothing...

Resentfully, Sidney moves about the room.  Sensing the
silent accusation against him, he is aggressive.

                         SIDNEY
            You know, Sally, sometimes I get
            the impression you think you live
            in Star-Bright Park.  This is life,
            kid - get used to it!

Sidney comes to the phone on her desk.  He dials.  Then he
glances swiftly at Sally and, carrying the phone, walks into
the bedroom, dragging the long cord behind him.

INT. BEDROOM

When the phone comes alive, Sidney pushes the bedroom door
shut.  The gesture is as casual as he can contrive to make
it.  Keeping his voice fairly low so that it cannot be heard
in the other room, he says:

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Nikko, is Mr. Hunsecker there?
            This is Mr. Falco.  Well, have him
            call me as soon as he can.  It's
            important.

He sets the phone down on the bedside table, looks at it
thoughtfully before he goes back to the bedroom door, opens
it and goes back into the office.

INT. OFFICE

Sidney stands on the threshold, studying Sally.  His manner
is now more sympathetic as he asks:

                         SIDNEY
            Did you send my folks in Philly the
            check...?

                         SALLY
            Yes.

Leaving the bedroom door open, Sidney comes up to her,
watches her shrewdly, cautiously.

                         SIDNEY
                   (softly)
            I put a lotta trust in you,
            Chickie...

                         SALLY
                   (low-voiced)
            I know you do, Sidney.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't judge a situation where you
            don't know what's involved...

Sally is putting paper in the typewriter, trying to hold her
head up.

                         SALLY
            I'm not judging...

Sidney comes closer to her.  He puts his hand on the nape of
her neck, carrassing her.  Under his touch, the girl is
unhappy, and yet at the same time, responsive.  Sidney still
has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame.
Feeling her relaxed, Sidney bends and kisses her on the side
of the throat with more than negligence, for something about
her always excites him; his aggression tune in with her
submissiveness.

                         SALLY
                   (pathetically)
            I swear, Sidney, I can't help it -
            sometimes I wonder what I see in
            you...

                         SIDNEY
                   (murmuring)
            That's no way to talk...

                         SALLY
            Or what you see in me, for that
            matter...

                         SIDNEY
            Stay down town tonight.  Maybe
            we'll take in a show, etc.

                         SALLY
            If you want me to -

The phone in the bedroom rings.  Sidney, reacting sharply,
forgets his advances to Sally as he turns towards the bedroom.

                         SIDNEY
                   (exhilarated)
            You see?  Hunsecker's gotta phone ME!

He goes into the bedroom, closing the door as he goes.
Sally looks at the closed door.

INT. BEDROOM

Sidney has picked up the phone.

                         SIDNEY
                   (calmly)
            Hello, J.J....I presume you saw the
            Elwell smear.
                   (smiling)
            No, no medals - not yet.  Oh, it's
            worse than that - Aunty Van Cleve
            is firing them...from the horse's
            mouth... They were just here - in a
            panic...

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - THE STUDY - DAY

Hunsecker wears a dressing gown as he sits at his breakfast
table.  Behind him are the big glass windows to the terrace
overlooking the Manhattan skyline.  The papers are at
Hunsecker's elbow; his manner is crisp and cold:

                         HUNSECKER
            Who was just there?
                   (then)
            You'll be the death of me.  Sidalee!
            Why?  Didn't you just tell me that
            they've already traced this smear
            to you?  All they have to do now is
            to put two and two together and I'm
            a chicken in a pot!

RESUME SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Sidney smiles confidently, answers calmly:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., peace on earth, good will to
            men - it's working out just the way
            I planned.  Yeah, I guarantee this
            bomb will pop right on schedule,
            but you have to play your part -
            you be a Saint and let me be the
            Devil.  But I wanna talk to you
            first...

RESUME HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

Hunsecker pauses, eyes full of cold voltage.

                         HUNSECKER
            Don't come here.  Susie is up and
            about.
                   (listening)
            He called her?  You'd better see me
            at the TV - three o'clock.

He bangs down the phone, tense thought in his manner.

INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT

Sally is busy with her typing again, but in a depressed mood
when Sidney comes out of the bedroom to put the phone down
on her desk again.  He seems satisfied with himself, smug.
Sally watches him for a moment.  Then:

                         SALLY
            What are you going to do?

Sidney prepares to leave the apartment.  His tone is full of
confidence, self-assertive.  (For once Sidney is certain
that he is smarter, more cunning than even Hunsecker).

                         SIDNEY
                   (the wise one)
            Chickie, a lotta people think
            they're smart.  You watch.  They're
            dumb: they'll do the work for me!
            Just watch.

Sidney makes for the door, goes out.

INT. CIGAR STAND - LOBBY

Susan buys paper - DOLLY with her - toward elevator - she
gets in.

INT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM

J.J. has not moved; he is thoughtful and morose.  Nikko, the
Japanese butler, comes in to remove the breakfast table.

                         HUNSECKER
            The table can wait.  No calls.  I
            have to think about my TV show.

                         NIKKO
            Pleased to do.  I will come back
            later.
                         HUNSECKER
                   (abruptly)
            Did you put the bread out on the
            terrace for the birds?

                         NIKKO
            Yes, but they don't come no more
            this time of year.

Smiling, Nikko leaves.  Hunsecker picks up a pencil and
makes a note on a pad, about birds no doubt.  Abruptly he
looks up, calling:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie!  Come in a minute, dear...

She has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room.  She
comes forward to him; her manner is serious and wary.  His
act is one of a tasteful Mammy singer, but he is watchful,
too.

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, you're very much in my
            thoughts today.

                         SUSAN
            Why?

                         HUNSECKER
            What a question, dear, with that
            newspaper in your hand...

                         SUSAN
                   (pausing)
            Did Sidney tell you about it?

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this
            boy too well.  Anything in these
            charges?

She shakes her head.

                         HUNSECKER
            Not being partial, are you?

                         SUSAN
                   (with quiet certainty)
            No, I'm not.  I'm not!

He soothes, smiles indulgent, but watchful:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, take it easy.  I'll trust
            your judgment - you don't have to
            protest with me.

With a paternal gesture of affection, he holds out his arms,
inviting her into his comforting embrace.  Not wanting to,
she walks into his open waiting arms.

                         HUNSECKER
            Why are you trembling, dear...?

                         SUSAN
            History repeats itself.  Everything
            that happened to Alan Leslie...began
            with a smear like this...

Hunsecker considers this gravely, as if it was a new and
troubling thought.

                         HUNSECKER
            Yes...

She leaves his arms; he watches keenly.

                         SUSAN
                   (incoherent)
            It's just as if I've seen a ghost
            today...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quickly)
            But that wasn't your fault, dear,
            what happened to Leslie.  I've told
            you that a million times...

He goes to her gently; she appraises both him and her
wrenched life with brooding, frightened eyes.

                         SUSAN
            Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It
            was someone's fault, wasn't it?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (gravely)
            I wouldn't have called the boy
            exactly balanced...

                         SUSAN
                   (stronger)
            Alan was not...unbalanced when I
            married him.  And he was
            not...'indifferent to women' no
            matter what they said!
                         HUNSECKER
                   (simply)
            I'm not fighting with you, puss...

She gets up and walks around in considerable agitation.

                         SUSAN
            He never would have killed himself
            if I hadn't gone through with the
            annulment.  Don't you see that made
            all the rumors seem true?  I should
            have stood up for him...not run out.

She turns to Hunsecker, her manner firmer.

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., I want you to get them back
            their job, Steve and the Quintet.

                         HUNSECKER
                   ("incredulously")
            You mean they've been fired already,
            on the basis of this crude smear?

He walks away with a wag of indignation,  but turns, asking:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, you're sure there isn't some
            fire where there's this much smoke?

Susan shakes her head emphatically.

                         SIDNEY
                   (earnestly)
            I know Steve.  No.

                         HUNSECKER
            Then maybe you can tell me if he's
            as solid as you say, why does he
            rap me every chance he gets?

                         SUSAN
                   (involuntarily)
            Sidney is a liar!

                         HUNSECKER
            Who said Sidney?

                         SUSAN
                   (defiantly)
            I said Sidney!...

Staring, he pauses; then he deftly changes the subject.

                         HUNSECKER
            You know, dear, we're drifting
            apart, you and I, and I don't like
            that.

                         SUSAN
            I thought we were talking about
            Sidney?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with rasp)
            Let me finish, dear.  You had your
            say, now let me have mine...

                         SUSAN
                   (interrupting)
            I haven't said anything yet, J.J.,
            but if -

Susan hesitates.  Hunsecker waits for her to continue.  But
she isn't yet sure enough of herself or of the point she
means to make.  She turns away.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (gently)
            I started to say we're drifting
            apart.  A year ago, in your wildest
            dreams, would you have walked by
            that door without taking up this
            situation with me?  Today I had to
            call you in!

                         SUSAN
            I'm taking up the situation with
            you now...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (interrupting)
            Susie, I want to help you--,
            there's nothing I won't do for you.
            You're all I've got in the whole,
            wide world.

Hunsecker strides about, elaborately playing on a note of
disillusion and pain.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            Well, what have I got?  Alimony to
            a pair of tramps?  They're of no
            concern to me.  It's you who count,
            but don't get me wrong - I don't
            intend to let you break your neck
            again!

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., you said you want to help
            me - prove it!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (quietly)
            How?

                         SIDNEY
            Get Steve back his job...please...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (pausing)
            He means that much to you...?

                         SIDNEY
                   (simply)
            Yes.
                   (then)
            With your "prestige" it only takes
            a minute - ten cents worth of
            American Tel and Tel.

                         HUNSECKER
            You're picking up my lingo, hon.

                         SIDNEY
                   (levelly)
            I read your column every day...

He looks at her with pursed lips and, for a change, some
real interest.  Her level, straightforward manner has pinned
him down completely; he shows a slow, charming grin, as he
goes for a private phone book:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, I like this new attitude of
            yours.  You're growing up and I
            like it!  I don't like it when
            you're limp and dependent, when
            you're odd and wayward.  This gives
            you a chance for real survival in a
            very lousy world.  Because, don't
            forget, dear, you won't always have
            me with you, will you...?

                         SIDNEY
            No, I won't...

He crosses to the white desk phone, delaying dialing for a
moment:

                         HUNSECKER
            This Dallas boy must be good for
            you.  Why not bring him around
            today, before the show?  This time
            I'll clean my glasses for a better
            look.

Susan doesn't like this idea, is evasive:

                         SIDNEY
            I'm not sure I can reach him in time.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (easily)
            Sure you can if you want to, and I
            know you'll want to...
                   (then)
            By the way, what's your beef
            against little Sidney?

                         SUSAN
                   (steadily)
            When I'm certain, I'll let you
            know...

                         HUNSECKER
            A man couldn't ask for a squarer
            shake.
                   (into phone)
            Let me have Billy Van Cleve...
                   (then)
            Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how
            I'm tied to your apron strings...
                   (to phone)
            Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about
            that boy?  What boy?  Where are we,
            lug, in a drawing room comedy?
            You're brain is warming up,
            sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...
                   (then)
            No, don't explain your point of
            view, but...

EXT. TV THEATRE - DAY

CAMERA SHOOTS TOWARDS the entrance to the TV theatre.  A
line of people are queuing for Hunsecker's TV Broadcast
which is advertised by large posters beside the entrance.  A
taxi drives up in foreground; Susan Hunsecker gets out.

SIDNEY

Sidney comes up Sixth Avenue towards the theatre.  As he
reaches the corner of the building, he halts, having seen...

SUSAN

Susan is seen in the act of paying the driver.  As the taxi
pulls away, Susan walks CAMERA left.

TV THEATRE

Susan pauses, deciding not to enter the theatre; turning she
looks about her and waits on the sidewalk outside.

SIDNEY

Sidney decides that this is not the moment to approach Susan.
He glances down the sidestreet then moves off in that
direction.

SIDESTREET

Sidney moves down the sidestreet towards a stage entrance,
through which are emerging some TV technicians.  He slips
inside.

INT. TV STATION

Hunsecker is standing at a table, stop watch in hand,
reading aloud from a script which he is rehearsing and
timing.  Beside him sits Mary busy typing more of the
material from Hunsecker's handwritten note.  Mary is calm,
but he is irritable, trying to concentrate despite the
bustle around him.

An old movie star, MILDRED TAM, sits waiting in one of the
canvas-backed chairs supplied for the guests on the show.
BURTON, a manager, also waits, deadpan, at Hunsecker's elbow.
Hunsecker clicks his stop watch as he reads:

                         HUNSECKER
            "I was reminded of it this morning,
            when I noticed that the birds had
            gone South.  We want the same kind
            of freedom for ourselves - that's
            what the man said!
                   (he clicks the watch,
                   pauses to underline
                   the phrase, continues:)
            A man has the right to face his
            accusers!  That's the American Way!
            Who said?  The man said!  From..."

He turns in exasperation to Burton.

                         HUNSECKER
            Burton, don't stand around.  If I
            go over I'll cut some items off the
            tail...

Burton departs.  Mary whips a second sheet out of the
typewriter, hands it to Hunsecker.  As he accepts it,
Hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium.

SIDNEY

SHOOTING towards the auditorium, from Hunsecker's viewpoint.
Sidney mounts the steps onto the stage.  Seeing that the
columnist is surrounded but knowing that J.J. wants to talk
to him privately, Sidney loiters so that J.J. can join him
as soon as he chooses to.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Hunsecker.  Only momentarily distracted by private
considerations connected with Sidney's arrival, Hunsecker
returns to the business of timing the script.  He clicks the
watch again...

                         HUNSECKER
            "From Washington through to
            Jefferson, from Lincoln and F.D.R.
            right up to today - the Democratic
            Way of Life!  That's what the man
            said!  Nowadays it doesn't export
            to well...
                   (then, concluding)
            But you know...and I know...that
            our best secret weapon is D-E-M-O-
            C-R-A-C-Y.
                   (dropping to a modest tone)
            Let's never forget it, ladies and
            gentlemen."

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening,
rapt, to Hunsecker's words.  Sidney is less impressed with
J.J.'s eloquence.  At the conclusion, Mildred applauds
lightly.  She stands up and moves towards J.J.  J.J. wants
to talk to Sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star.

                         MILDRED TAM
            That's grand, just grand, J.J.!
                   (then, anxiously)
            Is my makeup all right?  You know,
            despite the scads of movies I've
            made, I've never appeared on TV
            yet...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (cutting her short)
            Of course, Mildred.  Of course.
            You look fine.
                   (swiftly summoning Mary)
            Mary, help Miss Tam - anything she
            wants; she's our star today.

Under the pretense of studying the typed script, J.J. walks
away across the stage.  Sidney strolls after him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A TRACKING SHOT.  Sidney comes up beside Hunsecker, falls
into step beside him.  As they cross towards a water cooler
at the back of the stage, they talk in rapid undertone.

                         HUNSECKER
            I got that boy coming over here.
                   (a glance at Sidney)
            What's so funny?

                         SIDNEY
                   (who is smiling faintly)
            With a pocket fulla firecrackers -
            good.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (narrowly)
            I think you loused this up but good.
            If I can trust my eyes, and I think
            I can, Susie knows all about your
            dirty work.

                         SIDNEY
                   (shrugging)
            Can't hurt...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (incredulously)
            Can't hurt?  I had to get him back
            his job.

                         SIDNEY
                   (smugly)
            I like that, too.
                   (closer, faster)
            Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in
            one neat bundle, addressed to the
            dumps - to oblivion.  We're going
            great, but please play it my way.
            I cased this kid.
            Know his ins and outs...He's fulla
            juice and vinegar, just begging for
            some big shot like you to give him
            a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a
            favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. -
            the porcupine bit - needles.

                         HUNSECKER
            But it's too late.  I got him back
            the job...

                         SIDNEY
                   (impatiently)
            No, that's the point - he won't
            accept your favor!  The manager
            yes, but not the boy.

A pause.  Hunsecker renumerates.

                         HUNSECKER
            Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll
            tell you that!

                         SIDNEY
            Sure, he steams her up - wants her
            to stand on her own two feet and
            all that jazz!

                         HUNSECKER
            And who's feet is she on now?

                         SIDNEY
            Presumably yours...
                   (a hasty addition)
            That's according to St. Dallas.

                         HUNSECKER
            What's this boy got that Susie likes?

                         SIDNEY
            Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

                         HUNSECKER
            What does that mean - integrity?

                         SIDNEY
                   (repeating as before)
            A pocket fulla firecrackers -
            looking for a match!
                   (grinning)
            It's a new wrinkle to tell the
            truth... I never thought I'd make a
            killing on some guy's "integrity".

Hunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration:

                         HUNSECKER
            Full of beans, ain't you?  But you
            know that you'll stand or fall by
            what you're doing now...

                         SIDNEY
                   (grins; confidently)
            Calculated risk.  Only we happen to
            know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm
            your star pupil -- I reflect back
            to you your own talent.

Hunsecker permits himself a faint smile.  Burton is
approaching with script in hand.

                         HUNSECKER
            I wouldn't like to take a bite of
            you; you're a cookie full of arsenic.

Sidney smirks.  He turns away and goes off towards the
auditorium in the background.

EXT. TV STATION - DAY

Frank D'Angelo pays a taxi out of which he and Steve have
just emerged.  Frank turns towards the boy, resuming a
conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the
entrance of the theatre.

                         STEVE
                   (depressed)
            I still think he's responsible for
            the smear.

                         D'ANGELO
            Not that I'm convinced, but you'll
            never prove it in a million years.
                   (gently)
            Steve, you'll do what you want, but
            it can't hurt; he offers you an
            olive branch - so today like olives!

                         STEVE
            I guess you're right, but -

Steve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head;
compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult.

D'ANGELO

D'Angelo studies the boy with a paternal affection.

                         D'ANGELO
            Steve, sometimes it's better not to
            look at your own honesty; but to
            look the other man in the face.
            Not because you're my meal ticket -
            which you are - but because I like
            you and the boys, please take my
            advice: we -

D'Angelo stops, halted by an expression which he sees in
Steve's face.

STEVE

He is looking through the glass doors of the TV Theatre, no
longer listening to D'Angelo's words; his face has hardened
in anger.

INT. TV THEATRE FOYER

From Steve's viewpoint.  Sidney has come out of the curtained
entrance to the auditorium.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Steve in foreground.  With a movement that suggests his
annoyance at discovering Sidney present, Steve jerks open
the glass door and moves in.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Susan is waiting in the foyer.  She is standing in a position
where she has not been able to see Steve until he enters;
now she moves forward to greet him.  As soon as she is near
him, she speaks in a quiet, urgent manner:

                         SUSAN
                   (in an undertone)
            Steve, before we go in - I'd like
            to...

But she, too, is halted as Steve lays a hand on her arm.
Seeing his look over her shoulder, she turns...

SIDNEY

He is already strolling forward to join them.  CAMERA PANS
with him to include Susie, Steve and D'Angelo.

                         SIDNEY
            Hey, Susie - This is a real
            surprise -- not one but three.
            J.J.'s just finishing up his
            rehearsal.

STAGE

Hunsecker comes forward to the front of the stage looking
towards...

STEVE, SUSAN, D'ANGELO AND SIDNEY

In the group that comes down the aisle of the empty theatre.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies them, then calls out:

                         HUNSECKER
            Looks like a wedding.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker back to CAMERA in foreground; he begins to whistle
The Wedding March to the rhythm of Steve and Susan's walk.

STEVE

He breaks the rhythm of his stride, his face rigid.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He descends to meet them; his manner is full of welcome.

REVERSE ANGLE

Susan nervously makes the introduction - Steve is nervous;
D'Angelo hangs behind warily; Sidney is in background.

                         SUSAN
            Steve, you remember my brother...

                         STEVE & HUNSECKER
                   (together)
            Of course.

Steve shakes the hand that the smiling Hunsecker gives.

                         HUNSECKER
            Well, son, looks like you went out
            and bought yourself a packet of
            trouble...

                         STEVE
            You've been very kind about it, Mr.
            Hunsecker.
                         HUNSECKER
            Give Susie credit for that.  I took
            her word that there was nothing to
            the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll
            have my say about smears on the
            show today.  That's why I'd like
            YOUR personal assurance, too.

                         STEVE
                   (quietly)
            Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to
            that smear.  You have my sincere
            word...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (nodding judicially)
            I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME
            a favor.
                   (pausing; to Susan)
            Be good to my kid sister...

                         SIDNEY
                   (solemnly)
            Yeah, she's had a peck of trouble
            for a kid...

Hunsecker flicks a look at Sidney.  No one else, warier by
the minute, knows what to say.  Hunsecker purrs onward:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie likes to keep her girlish
            secrets.  But in her heart of
            hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she
            fancies you in an uncommon way.
            Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just
            tom-catting around...I hope?

                         SUSAN
                   (quickly)
            J.J., Steve isn't...

Hunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature:

                         HUNSECKER
            Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't
            be much of a man if he didn't
            understand my concern.  Would you,
            son?

                         STEVE
                   (pausing, quietly)
            No, I wouldn't...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (nodding)
            Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I
            like your style, son!  In a world
            of old rags and bones, I like it!
            For instance, take Sidney.

Hunsecker crosses toward Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER (CONT'D)
            If Sidney got anywhere near Susie
            I'd break a bat over Sidney's head!
                   (smiling faintly)
            Sidney lives so much in a moral
            twilight that, when I said you were
            coming here, he predicted disaster.
            You wouldn't take my favor -- you'd
            chew up the job, he said, and spit
            it right back in my face!
                   (sniffing)
            Any truth in that...?

D'ANGELO, STEVE AND SUSAN

Steve is thrown for a loss momentarily; Frank steps in.

                         D'ANGELO
            No, Mr. Hunsecker, and if I can
            amplify --

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

                         HUNSECKER
                   (motionless)
            Don't amplify.

RESUME D'ANGELO, STEVE AND SUSAN

                         D'ANGELO
            Steve wantsa thank you for this
            favor.  He --

GROUP SHOT

                         SIDNEY
                   (provocatively)
            Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just
            told you to shut your mouth!

                         STEVE
                   (hotly)
            Don't you think it's about time you
            shut yours?  Who are you to tell a
            man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!

                         D'ANGELO
                   (warningly)
            Steve, that isn't important --

But Steve, on a heated rip, has turned to Hunsecker:

                         STEVE
            Does he have to be here in our hair?

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
            Why, has he bothered you before?

STEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN

                         STEVE
            Is it news to you?

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
            Son, lots of people tell me I'm a
            gifted man, but I still can't see
            around corners.

GROUP SHOT

                         HUNSECKER
                   (tolerantly)
            Just exactly what are you so hot
            about?
                   (waiting)
            I mean, I know it's a difficult
            thing to be an artist in this
            crudest of possible worlds, but --

                         STEVE
                   (impatiently)
            Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist!
            I'm here as an average Joe, who
            happens to love your sister Susie!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with ironic smirk)
            Well, just be careful you don't
            knock her down, huh?

Steve stops dead.  Then, strangely and dangerously, he picks
up Hunsecker's smile.  On each man's face the smile broadens
and grows up into a chuckle from each; but the meanness
still flickers around Hunsecker's mouth.  Steve is out of
the net!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (affably)
            Frankly, son, you lost me on that
            last hill.  Just give us the punch
            line...

                         STEVE
                   (agreeably)
            No punch line.  Maybe I was just
            admiring your know-how---yours and
            Falco's.

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

                         HUNSECKER
            Why do you keep coupling me with
            Falco?

STEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN

                         STEVE
                   (innocently)
            He's here, isn't he?  Do you think,
            sir, when he dies he'll go to the
            dog and cat heaven?

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Even Hunsecker smiles.  Sidney likes neither the ridicule or
the turn of events.  He moves quickly past CAMERA.

SIDNEY, STEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN

Sidney comes round the row of theatre seats to attack Steve.

                         SIDNEY
            Let's forget cats and dogs and
            other pseudo-literary remarks---
            I'll just lay it on the line!  What
            about that big rumpus in my office
            today?  You were there, Frank!
            Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J.
            was responsible for the Elwell smear!

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
            Don't go wild, Sidney.

GROUP SHOT

                         SIDNEY
            Wild?  Take a look at them and see
            who's wild...

Playing along nicely, Hunsecker looks at Steve and Frank and
slowly removes his arm from Susan; he pauses before asking
Dallas:

                         HUNSECKER
            What about that...?

                         D'ANGELO
                   (uneasily)
            Steve was excited...he didn't mean
            it exactly the way it's stated
            here...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Steve)
            How did you mean it...?

           SIDNEY                         SUSAN
  What he likes to---            J.J., I don't want to say---

With a roar Hunsecker takes them both out of play; he stands
up.

SIDNEY, STEVE, D'ANGELO

Hunsecker enters from behind CAMERA.

                         HUNSECKER
            Both of you keep quiet!
                   (to Sidney)
            You've made more damage here in one
            minute than a plague of locusts!
            If you're tired, Susie, sit down---
            this needs investigation!
                   (to Steve, quieter)
            How did you mean it...?
                   (waiting)
            Come on, let's go!  Let's go!...

Steve is cornered, the other completely out of play.  He
pauses:

                         STEVE
            I don't take kindly to you and
            Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the
            injured party here, you?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with contempt)
            Right now you're in no position to
            ask questions!  And your snide
            remarks---

                         STEVE
                   (stronger)
            Wait a minute, I haven't handed
            over punishing privileges to you
            YET!  Put the whip down and I might
            respect what you're saying...

Switching his leonine tail, Hunsecker looks broodingly at
Susie.  Frank says one beseeching word, "Steve...", but no
one hears him.

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, did you know about this
            accusation...?

SUSAN

                         SUSAN
                   (mutely)
            No...

HUNSECKER

                         HUNSECKER
                   (abruptly)
            Before you leave, son, I'll answer
            your question---Susan Hunsecker is
            the injured party here!
                   (balefully)
            Or will I be hearing next that I
            don't even have my sister's welfare
            at heart...

STEVE AND SUSAN

Steve hesitates defensively but can't resist a small smile;
he moves nearer to Susan.

                         STEVE
            Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more
            twists than a barrel of pretzels.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (unturning)
            You hear that, Susie...
                   (to Steve)
            Continue please...

                         STEVE
                   (shaking his head)
            I'm afraid I can't cope with them.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
                   (simply)
            You're too shrewd for me so I'll
            just be honest.  Susie and I love
            each other, if I'm not mistaken,
            and we want to get married.

Hunsecker pauses; Sidney throws in a stage whisper:

                         SIDNEY
            Give him credit---the boy's gall is
            gorgeous!

                         STEVE
            Why don't we hear what Susie has to
            say?

                         HUNSECKER
                   (sardonically)
            That's stout of you, Dallas, but
            Susie may not care to air her
            dismal views in public...

Steve walks to Susie, trying to lift her with his hopes and
air of gentle urging and support.

                         STEVE
            Susie...?

SUSAN

She stares at the floor.

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker doesn't like the drift of things; his mouth
tightens and he speaks to Susan with veiled warning:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie, as always, is free to say
            anything she thinks.  Go on, dear,
            say exactly what's on your mind,
            dear.

                         STEVE
            Those "dears" sound like daggers.
            May I suggest that you stop DARING
            her to speak?

                         HUNSECKER
            May I lift my eyebrows?  What is
            this?  What are you trying to do?

                         STEVE
                   (strongly)
            I'm trying to get Susie to stand up
            to you.  But your manner is so
            threatening that she's afraid to
            speak!

                         HUNSECKER
            Son, you raise your voice again and
            you'll be outa here on your golden
            pratt!

SUSAN

Suddenly Susan lets loose, with restrained nervous energy;
she is near to tears.

                         SUSAN
            Steve, if only for my sake, I want
            this stopped!  And the same goes
            for you, too, J.J.!

HUNSECKER

He interjects.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (contritely)
            Susie, I'm sorry if---

RESUME SUSAN

                         SUSAN
                   (bitterly)
            Sometimes I think ALL men are
            fools!...

Restraining tears, she runs up the steps to the stage.

STEVE, HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Steve looks after her.  Sidney watches intently.  Hunsecker's
smile is frostily taunting:

                         HUNSECKER
            You see, Dallas, a plague on both
            our houses...
                   (then)
            We may have to call this game on
            account of darkness...

Steve turns a blank-eyed stare at him.  Tension gone, a slow
mumbling fatigue has set in.  Hunsecker plays it light:

                         HUNSECKER
            If looks could kill, I'm dead...

                         STEVE
                   (slowly)
            No, I don't care about you --
            you're fantastic.  My whole
            interest, if it's not too late, is
            in Susie...and how to undo what
            you've done to her...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (smiling)
            And what have I done to her,
            besides not buy her a new fur coat
            lately?  Sidney, you were right --
            the boy's a dilly.

                         STEVE
                   (stung)
            Why?  Because I don't like the way
            you toy with human lives? - Your
            contempt and malice?  Because I
            won't be the accomplice of your
            sick ego - and the way it's crippled
            Susie...?  You think of yourself -
            you and your column - you see
            yourself as a national glory...but
            to me, and thousands of others like
            me, you and your slimy scandal,
            your phony patriotics - to me, Mr.
            Hunsecker, you are a national
            disgrace!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (blandly)
            Son, I don't fancy shooting
            mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So
            suppose you just shuffle along and
            call it a day...

He turns and stares away, but Steve stops him with---

                         STEVE
            But my day with Susie isn't over
            yet and--

                         HUNSECKER
                   (cold)
            Ten'll get you fifty you're playing
            hookey from a padded cell!

STAGE

Hunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium, Sidney
following closely behind.  In background, beyond, Steve and
D'Angelo are walking up the aisle to the exit.  CAMERA
TRACKS CLOSE on Sidney and Hunsecker.  Hunsecker's face is
rigid.  Sidney, close at his elbow, whispers:

                         SIDNEY
                   (softly)
            You did it, J.J., you did it good...

Sidney is full of confidence.  But Hunsecker barely hears
him (Hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boy's
attack; in particular, by the appalling fear that what Steve
has said is the kind of thing which Susan may also secretly
believe.)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Susan is still standing in the wings.  Mary is with her,
obviously sympathetic.  The girl is drying her eyes with
Kleenex, and Mary glances at her employer with a look of
reproach.  Hunsecker walks round the table, obviously trying
to approach Susan; seeing this, Susan turns away and moves
further from him.  Hunsecker stops.

HUNSECKER

There is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the
girl.  More gently, he moves forward past CAMERA...

SUSAN

Sensing the approach of Hunsecker behind her, she moves away
again; she is still crying, but is trying to recover.
Presently Hunsecker approaches her again.  He speaks very
gently, soothingly, comforting...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (softly)
            You in a mood, Susie, to run over
            to Milgrim's later and buy a few
            new frocks?

                         SUSAN
                   (a small voice)
            No.  I'm going home.

Hunsecker again tries to come nearer to her.

                         HUNSECKER
            Want Sidney to drive you over?

Ignoring the shake of her head, he calls to Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER
            Drive Susie home.

HUNSECKER

Again we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl.
His eyes flick towards the stage behind him where Sidney
stands watching.  He moves gently forward and then speaks in
a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her
reassurance:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie...I...I'd have to take it
            very much amiss if you ever saw
            that boy again.

SUSAN

After a pause, she turns towards him; she looks him straight
in the face.

                         SUSAN
                   (levelly)
            I'll never see him again.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her.
Now he touches her.  His need for her is apparent; he tries
to reach her, tries to find an excuse to embrace her.  She
submits to this very passively.

SUSAN

A VERY CLOSE SHOT.  We see the effort with which she is
controlling herself.

RESUME TWO SHOT

Satisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister,
Hunsecker lets her go.  Susan moves away, still avoiding his
eyes.  Then she goes off towards the steps down into the
auditorium.  Sidney looks at Hunsecker, then after Susan and
follows her.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He goes back to Mary and the script.  He instructs her:

                         HUNSECKER
            Call Van Cleve.  Tell him he was
            right.  Tell him I said the Dallas
            boys are not worthy of his club.

Poring over the typewritten pages, he senses Mary's eyes on
him.  He speaks to her quietly without raising his head and
there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (without looking up)
            Mary...for Susie's own good...don't
            give her misplaced sympathy...

Mary says nothing.  Hunsecker gathers his papers and with a
visible effort to resume his public personality turns
towards the machinery of the television broadcast in
background.

INT. TV THEATRE FOYER

Susan crosses towards the doors out onto the street.  Sidney
comes behind her, watchful as he overtakes her near the
doors.  He goes past her to open the door for her.

                         SIDNEY
            I'll get you a cab...

Susan stops dead.

                         SUSAN
                   (coldly)
            Get away from me.

She goes out into the street.  Beyond, we see a crushing cab.
Hesitating, Sidney adds:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J. asked me to drive you over
            and -

But Susan has already moved out of shot, hurrying across the
sidewalk to hail the taxi.

RESUME SIDNEY

Uncertain what to do, whether to follow her or not, he moves
after her.

SUSAN

She has already opened the door of the taxi.  She turns to
see Sidney come up behind her.  As he enters SHOT, she
repeats:

                         SUSAN
            I told you to leave!  I don't know
            if Steve'll ever talk to me again
            and I'm ready to blame it all on you!

She starts to get into the cab...

SIDNEY

Alert, he moves to detain her (anxious to know exactly the
extent of her suspicion.)

                         SIDNEY
            Susie...!

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Sidney steps up, he grasps at the door of the taxi,
trying to hold it open, but Susan pulls it shut, catching
his fingers in the door.  Sidney steps back in pain...

TAXI

It drives off down Sixth Avenue.

SIDNEY

Nursing the injury to his hand, he looks after the
disappearing taxi.  As he recovers from the pain, his
expression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal.
(Susan's suspicions maybe of less importance than some other
considerations.)

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB WASHROOM - NIGHT

Hunsecker and Sidney are washing in adjoining basins.  Coat
off, the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence.
Sidney, despite his throbbing, bandaged finger, is feeling
satisfied and self-confident.  He hums quietly.  Hunsecker
throws him annoyed side-glances, but Sidney refuses to
"catch on".  The following dialogue is spaced between the
washing, the drying and hair-combing.

                         HUNSECKER
            So that's what "integrity" looks
            like.  Well, I'm always willing to
            learn...
                   (later)
            How is that slob, D'Angelo, your
            uncle?

Sidney no longer hums; after a moment, he answers.

                         SIDNEY
            My mother's side--her brother.
            That reminds me, J.J., Susie looks
            run down.  She can stand a vacation
            and so can you.  People say, "Oh,
            the great J.J., he's made of
            iron!", but you can use a rest, guy.

Sidney's cheerfulness annoys Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER
            What are you so chipper about?  If
            I put a cross on every one of your
            mistakes, you'd look like a
            graveyard!

                         SIDNEY
                   (smiling)
            But not for anything I did today...

                         HUNSECKER
            Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie
            lied to me - she'll see that boy
            again.

Hunsecker moves out of shot.

                         SIDNEY
            You're right, J.J. - she won't give
            him up, but it doesn't matter.
            Because the real "money ball" is
            the boy, not Susan.  And if --

Hearing the sound of the door, Sidney turns sharply.  CAMERA
MOVES to discover that Hunsecker has gone out.  Sidney,
quickly, finishing the brushing of his hair, follows...

INT. DINING ROOM - "21" CLUB

Two waiters are fussing over Hunsecker's table at which
places are already set for Sidney and Hunsecker.  Matre d'
hands him an envelope as he passes.

                         MATRE D'
            Mr. Hunsecker this was to be
            delivered to you personally -

When the columnist comes up to the table, the waiters
quickly pull out the table for him.  Sidney comes to join
him; Sidney gets some attention, but considerably less.
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.

                         HUNSECKER
            These drinks are warm.

                         WAITER
            You said you like to have them on
            your table.

                         HUNSECKER
            What are you a critic?

                         WAITER
            I'll change --

                         HUNSECKER
            Forget it.
                   (to Sidney)
            The real money ball is the boy...

                         SIDNEY
            Yeah, the boy...we're on the verge
            of a farce, a real farce.  As I see
            it, if Susie had stood behind him
            today he might have proved a threat.
            But since primarily he's wedded to
            his work, he's not going to be able
            to take it.

A waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at Hunsecker's
elbow.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to waiter)
            Stop tinkering, pal - that horse
            radish won't jump a fence!

The waiter retreats rapidly.

                         SIDNEY
            In brief, J.J., it's all over
            because any hour now the boy will
            give her up.  Is it a farce or not?

Delicately salting his oysters, Hunsecker looks obliquely at
Sidney.

                         HUNSECKER
            This syrup you're giving out,
            Sidney, you pour over waffles, not
            J.J. Hunsecker!  What do you mean
            that lousy kid will give up my
            sister?

Hunsecker, with a casual gesture, tugs lightly at the end of
Sidney's tie.

Hunsecker's gesture is playful, but it inflicts great injury
to Sidney's dignity; Sidney cannot bear to be touched; he
finds this liberty on J.J.'s part as intolerable as anything
he has experienced, and only with great difficulty controls
himself.  The SHOT FAVORS Sidney.

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Hunsecker continues:

                         HUNSECKER
            Are you listening?

                         SIDNEY
                   (warily)
            How does it matter who's sister?
            The main thing, they're through
            and -

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Without turning, Hunsecker
interrupts:

                         HUNSECKER
            Am I supposed to forget how that
            boy talked to me today?

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney senses a warning in Hunsecker's manner.  He protests:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., is he worthy of a second
            glance from a man like you?  Is he,
            I mean?...

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.  Pausing during the process of
eating, Hunsecker reaches into an inside pocket.

                         HUNSECKER
            Brief epitaph: "The boy was talking
            when he should have been listening."
                   (then)
            Bite on this.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney as Hunsecker tosses in
front of him an envelope.  Sidney opens it, extracts two
steamship tickets.

                         SIDNEY
            Steamship tickets?
                         HUNSECKER
                   (as he eats)
            For the next sailing of the Mary.
            Susan's run down - she's never been
            abroad and as you so cogently put
            it, I'm not made of iron.

Sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to Hunsecker, who
leaves it lying on the table before him.

                         SIDNEY
            That's good.  Now that louse is
            outa Susie's hair for good.

SIDNEY

He has an instinct to laugh; but something tells him not to.

HUNSECKER

As Sidney makes no response, Hunsecker slowly, carefully
continues in a voice which is dangerously soft:

                         HUNSECKER
            I want that boy taken apart.

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  Sidney puts down his
fork.  He sees now that the issue is serious and must be
faced.

                         SIDNEY
                   (seriously)
            Why do something that would drive
            them right back into each other's
            arms?  Not to mention that this
            time Susie would know who shot the
            arrow...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (interjecting quietly)
            She knows now.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            Why give her real proof?  You
            nearly ruined her with her first
            husband - and you were right,
            J.J., - but she almost followed him
            out the window.  What do you want -
            a chronic invalid?

HUNSECKER

He wants no advice from Sidney.  He interrupts with quiet
savagery.

                         HUNSECKER
            I know how to handle Susie.  You
            just handle the boy, Sidney...
                   (scribbles on scratch pad)
            ...preferably tonight.
                   (pushes pad across to Sidney)


SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  Sidney feels sick.

                         SIDNEY
            Why, what's tomorrow - a holiday?

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as Sidney picks scratch pad up.  We can
read two words: "Get Kello".

                         SIDNEY
            I think I'll go home - maybe I left
            my sense of humor in another suit.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker finishes eating.  During the ensuing speech, which
he begins quietly and sensibly, Hunsecker's venomous feelings
are unexpectedly betrayed.

                         HUNSECKER
            You've got that God-given brain -
            learn to use it!  Do you think it's
            a personal matter with me, this boy?
            Are you telling me I see things in
            terms of personal pique?  Don't you
            see that today that boy wiped his
            feet on the choice, on the
            predilections of sixty million men
            and women of the greatest country
            in the world!  If you had any
            morals yourself, you would
            understand the immorality of that
            boy's stand today!  It was not me
            he criticized - it was my readers!...

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney.  Hunsecker manages to
control himself; he reaches with nervous fingers toward his
scribbling pad.

SIDNEY

Sidney's face has tightened.  He has begun now to realize
the extent of this man's megalomania.  After a moment he
says:

                         SIDNEY
            I'm leaving, J.J....

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

SHOOTING ACROSS Sidney onto Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (a quiet warning)
            Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney;
            you may wanna get back on board.

SIDNEY

Sidney feels the chill of despair upon him.

                         HUNSECKER
            This crab gumbo - terrific!

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  A waiter has come to
serve the next course.  Hunsecker appears relaxed, but
Sidney is sightlessly staring at the piece of paper in his
hand.  He speaks with a quaver in his voice, for he has
worked hard to make a life which is now ready to relinquish:

                         SIDNEY
            J.J., it's one thing to wear your
            dog collar...but when it gets to be
            a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.

                         HUNSECKER
            The man in jail is always for
            freedom.

Sidney begins to get up from the table.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he rises)
            Except, if you'll excuse me, I'm
            not in jail.

Hunsecker looks up at Sidney.

HUNSECKER

From Sidney's viewpoint.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (easily)
            Sure you're in jail, Sidney.
            You're a prisoner of your own
            fears, of your own greed and
            ambition; you're in jail.

SIDNEY

From Hunsecker's viewpoint.

                         SIDNEY
            J.J.  If you're trying to -

He leans over Hunsecker and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Hunsecker in f.g.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (interrupting)
            You, little boy, don't know who you
            are!  Talking around corners with
            the big shots, ten dollar dinners -
            fourteen suits and cashmere coats -
            you tell yourself THAT'S who you
            are!  Later you won't know who you
            are without a penthouse on upper
            Park!  But underneath it all,
            ratting around from day to day, you
            DO know who you are!  You're a
            fearful, ignorant nobody - a poor
            wop kid from the slums of Philly -
            hoping nobody else finds it out!

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP.  He knows the truth of what is said.  But he
takes refuge in quiet retaliation:

                         SIDNEY
            A little hunch occurs to me - you
            have just painted a self-portrait.
            You know who YOU are because you
            scare people - that's what you've
            got against this boy.  He -

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker is prepared to give it out, but not take it.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (cutting in)
            I told you what I want you to do
            tonight!

SIDNEY

He looks down on Hunsecker, leans over the table.

                         SIDNEY
            You're blind, Mr. Magoo.  This is a
            crossroads for me.  I won't get
            Kello.  Not for a life-time pass to
            the Polo Grounds.  Not if you serve
            me Ingrid Bergman on a plate.

CAMERA has PULLED BACK to include Hunsecker, whose attention
has returned to his food.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (over patient)
            Sidney, I told you -

                         SIDNEY
                   (continuing)
            J.J., I swear to you on my mother's
            life, I won't do it.
                   (he leans even closer)
            If you gave me your COLUMN I
            wouldn't do a thing like that...

But as he speaks the last words, Sidney's voice falters
because he has glanced down at the table...

SIDNEY

We see that an idea has entered his head - an idea that
takes the wind out of his indignation.  His eyes lift
rapidly to Hunsecker's face.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (delicately touching
                   the envelope)
            And who do you think writes the
            column while Susie and I are away
            for three months?...

RESUME SIDNEY

He is quite speechless.  Over scene Hunsecker's voice:

                         HUNSECKER (V.O.)
                   (continuing)
            ...The man in the moon?

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

CAMERA SHOOTS across Sidney again onto Hunsecker.  Hunsecker
leans back, looks at Sidney.

Seeing that Sidney has accepted the proposition, he smiles.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (softly)
            Thank you, Sidney.

In a pleasantly affable way, he leans across the table to
tap the hand with which Sidney is leaning on the table.

                         HUNSECKER
            And, Sidney, I'll have that piece
            of paper back...

Helplessly, Sidney unclenches a fist and reveals the slip of
paper which he had meant to keep.  Hunsecker takes it.  With
his eyes on Sidney, he slowly tears it up...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

CIGAR STAND AND PHONE BOOTH - EVENING

D'Angelo is buying a cigar at the counter.  He turns as
Steve opens the door of one of the booths and comes out.
Steve is in a gloomy, irksome mood; D'Angelo is sympathetic
and fatherly.

                         STEVE
            She'll be down in a minute.

CAMERA TRACKS with them as they come out into the hallway.
They move towards the side entrance, away from the elevators.

                         D'ANGELO
            What does she wanna see you about?

The boy shrugs impatiently.

                         STEVE
            She didn't say.

Some passersby come down the hall and enter a waiting
elevator, barely glancing at D'Angelo and the boy.  D'Angelo
feels uneasy.

                         D'ANGELO
            I could think of better places to
            meet her, instead of here.  He
            lives on the whole top floor.

                         STEVE
                   (carelessly)
            I doubt that it matters any more.

D'ANGELO

He addresses Steve soberly.

                         D'ANGELO
            Steve.  You made a very dangerous
            enemy of him today.  Matter of
            fact, I'm very glad we got the tour
            ahead.  If I'm any judge, you hurt
            him today where he lives... He
            won't forget it and he won't
            forgive...

RESUME STEVE AND D'ANGELO

Steve is silent.  He hears the sound of the elevator door
opening and turns.

Susan comes out of the elevator, the one farthest from them,
and looks around.

                         SUSAN
                   (as she comes forward
                   to join them)
            Good evening, Mr. D'Angelo.

D'Angelo acknowledges her greeting, touches his hat and
retires tactfully.  Susan faces Steve.  It's an awkward
meeting.  Each does not know where the other stands.  She
has thrown her fur coat about her shoulders like a cloak; it
will keep slipping off.  He is faintly embittered, a little
hurt and baffled, but he is sympathetic; he is involved and
concerned.

MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT OVER SHOULDER - SUSAN TO STEVE

                         SUSAN
            Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could
            come.

                         STEVE
            Why did you call me?

                         SUSAN
            Would you buy me a cup of coffee?
            In there...

REVERSE ANGLE

Susan nods in the direction of the door into the little cafe.

                         STEVE
            Sure.

As he walks with her towards the cafe:

                         STEVE
            We're on our way to Robard's for a
            benefit.  I've only got five
            minutes...

INT. CAFE

As they enter the cafe, the Counterman looks up from counting
the day's take at the far end.

                         COUNTERMAN
            Too late for service.

                         STEVE
            Just two cups of java.

                         COUNTERMAN
                   (with a twinkle)
            We serve here only moka coffee.

                         STEVE
                   (smiling faintly)
            Make it moke.

The Counterman goes to the urn for the coffee.

SUSAN AND STEVE

A closer angle.  They talk in quiet undertones.  Steve waits
for her to speak first; she starts slowly, hesitantly, with
difficulty:

                         SUSAN
            Steve...what you tried to do
            today...you tried to take me up on
            a high mountain...I couldn't go all
            the way...I failed you...
                   (a pause)
            Will you forgive me?
                   (then)
            Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?

                         STEVE
            Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But
            there's no doubt, Susie, that we
            have to face some serious things...

                         SUSAN
            No one's ever stood up to my
            brother the way you did.

                         STEVE
                   (quietly, to the point)
            But you didn't do much about it,
            Susie.  You walked out, and there I
            was...solo...and not too good at
            that.

                         SUSAN
            I just didn't think that I could
            antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR
            sake, I mean.

STEVE

                         STEVE
            Susie, I was there for OUR sake,
            too.  But what a world it would be
            if we were all afraid to learn to
            walk and talk because it might
            offend poppa!  By the way, I think
            your brother was completely
            responsible for the smears...

SUSAN

This accusation is made lightly, in passing.  But Susan
reacts to it, trying to interject:

                         SUSAN
            Steve, I...

                         STEVE
                   (overriding her)
            But I don't care about that now.
            He knew what he was doing today.
            He was laying down the conditions
            under which he MIGHT consent to our
            marriage - if I would bend to every
            whim of his, like Sidney!  I
            couldn't do that, Susie...

SUSAN

After a pause, she says:

                         SUSAN
            You're saying goodbye, aren't you?

SUSAN AND STEVE

Steve flares up.

                         STEVE
            No!  I'm saying that for your sake
            you have to make a clean break with
            your brother!

                         SUSAN
                   (wrenched)
            But, please, Steve, please - one
            step at a time!  I was born only
            yesterday!...

                         STEVE
                   (pausing, softer)
            I told your brother I couldn't be
            his accomplice.  I can't be yours
            either, Susie, and encourage him to
            go on pulverizing you.  I know what
            type - he's my old man all over
            again!

Susan, pathetically despairing, fingers the handle of her
coffee cup, which she has not touched.  The coat slips from
her shoulders...

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve stoops to pick it up, replaces it on her shoulders.

                         STEVE
            This beautiful coat is more than
            just a coat... I hate it!  It's a
            mink straight-jacket!

Susan turns to him.  She is deflated, lacking all will power.

                         SUSAN
                   (drooping)
            Steve, I feel exhausted...what do
            you want me to do?

                         STEVE
                   (not sure of himself)
            Not what you're doing now.  At
            least don't ask me - don't ask him.
            You're fighting for your life!
            What do YOU want to do?

                         SUSAN
                   (pausing, woodenly)
            You are saying goodbye, aren't
            you...?

STEVE

He reacts vigorously, protesting:

                         STEVE
                   (impatiently)
            That's fish four days old...!  I
            can't buy it, Susie!  Right out of
            that mouth I love, like you're a
            ventriloquist's dummy, your BROTHER
            is saying goodbye!  Gee!...you want
            me to be honest, don't you?!

SUSAN

A despairing cry:

                         SUSAN
            No, Steve, I don't.  I don't.  Not
            if it KILLS me I don't!...

SUSAN AND STEVE

It takes her a moment to recover.  When she does so, she
gets up, leaving the counter.

                         SUSAN
                   (without luster)
            Let's not talk any more...you have
            to go...

She moves towards the exit into the hallway; he follows.

HALLWAY

D'Angelo is waiting for them.  Silently they come up to join
him, very depressed.  Susan looks towards D'Angelo, speaks a
little pathetically:

                         SUSAN
            Goodbye, Mr. D'Angelo.  Take care
            of Steve.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (softly)
            I will, Miss Hunsecker.

He walks a little way down the corridor, again leaving them
alone.

SUSAN AND STEVE

She smiles at him, trying to smile, trying to make a joke.

                         SUSAN
            Say something funny...Mr.
            Hasenfeffer.

Steve steps to her quickly, kisses her.  Then he turns and
swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward
glance.  He goes past D'Angelo, who walks quietly after him
towards the exit in background.

SUSAN

She remains just in the attitude in which he left her.

EXT. BRILL BUILDING - NIGHT

Steve comes out of the door, pauses without looking back.
D'Angelo comes up behind him.

                         STEVE
                   (after a moment)
            Look back, Frank, see if she's
            still standing there...

D'Angelo looks discreetly over his shoulder.

SUSAN

From D'Angelo's point of view.  She is still standing where
Steve left her.

RESUME STEVE AND D'ANGELO

D'Angelo turns back to Steve.

                         D'ANGELO
            Still there...

Steve, still without looking back, walks up the street;
CAMERA TRACKING WITH THEM.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (with sympathy)
            Not that I don't like her - she's a
            very lovely person, but who can
            tell?  A year from now you might
            thank your stars that it turned out
            this way.
                   (changing the subject)
            By the way, Robard said that...

Steve, his manner full of pain, stops.

                         STEVE
            Frank, I don't want to make the
            benefit.  They'll be jammin' all
            night, and the way I feel -- I'd
            like to be alone -- I'd like just
            to walk and walk and never come back.

D'Angelo takes him firmly by the arm.

                         D'ANGELO
            No.  I don't leave you alone on a
            night like this.  And, anyway, you
            promised...

Steve looks at him, knowing that he can never shake off the
devoted Frank; he shrugs.  They walk past CAMERA.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The heavy brass doors of the elevator slide open and the
Elevator Man pulls open the grille.  Susan, still in the
mood in which Steve left her, stands in the elevator for a
moment before she realizes that she has reached the top
floor.  As she walks out, the Elevator Man looks at her
anxiously.  CAMERA PANS with Susan towards the door to the
apartment.  Susan fumbles for her key.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

The apartment is dark as Susan enters.  She does not switch
on the lights.  She walks through the shadows of the big
room, which has a grim and menacing atmosphere.  She kicks
off her shoes and, hugging the coat about her for warmth
walks to the glass windows of the terrace.  After a moment
she opens them and steps out.

EXT. TERRACE - NIGHT

Susan walks across the terrace.  At this height the wind is
very strong.  CAMERA TRACKS with the girl, emphasizing the
dizzying panorama of New York at night.  The girl's manner
is strange; she moves as if under compulsion, a sleepwalker.
When she reaches the stone parapet, she leans against it
with her body slumped, still hugging the fur coat as if it
were some protection against her misery.

EXT. FROM THE TERRACE - NIGHT

Vertically downward.  From Susan's point of view.  The stone
sidewalks of Broadway are a terrifying distance below.

SUSAN

An angle, shooting sharply upwards against the night sky.
Wind blows the girl's hair, as she looks fixedly downwards.
Her face is blank, expressionless. (For a moment we may fear
for her, afraid that she may have suicide in mind.) But
presently she lifts her head looking towards the horizon...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA SHOOTS PAST the entrance to Robard's Club, framing
the outline of the bridge in sky in background.  From inside
comes the sound of music -- the Quintet.

The taxi drives up; Sidney gets out; he glances at his
wristwatch, looks around and then makes his way into the club.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Steve Dallas' Quintet on the stand.  CAMERA FRAMES the group
in foreground, SHOOTING towards the entrance way.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Sidney has come in through the entrance.  He is taking off
his overcoat.  He moves forward past the hat check room on
the left, approaching the recess in which several music
cases are stacked beside a coat rack on which the musicians'
overcoats are hung.

DETAIL

As he hangs up his coat, Sidney identifies the other coat, a
black and white check raglan which he (and we) saw Steve
wearing when he visited Hunsecker at the TV Studio.

SIDNEY

A CLOSE SHOT.  The coat appears to have some significance
for him; Sidney is under tension.

A waiter, carrying a carton of beer cans, comes out of the
doorway just behind Sidney, moving between him and the
overcoat.  Thus interrupted, Sidney turns away.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Robard is standing at the bar, surrounded by a group of his
cronies.  Drink is flowing and there is a sentimental mood
of celebration.

As Sidney arrives at the bar, ordering a drink, FRANK
D'ANGELO is seen coming from the interior of the club where
Dallas and the Quintet can be seen playing; D'Angelo accosts
Robard:

                         D'ANGELO
            Lew, Steve don't feel too good...

                         ROBARD
                   (interjecting)
            I'm sorry to hear it.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA shoots past D'Angelo and Robard in f.g. towards
Sidney, who overhears:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            ...So, if you don't mind, he'll
            leave after this set.

In b.g., Sidney sets down his drink, reacting to this
information.  Robard clamps D'Angelo on the shoulder,
reassuring him with warm emphasis:

                         ROBARD
            I like that boy, Frank.  Anything
            he does is okay with me...

SIDNEY

Sidney, thinking rapidly, leaves the bar, moving
unobtrusively but purposefully towards a telephone booth.
He enters and closes the door.

PHONE BOOTH

A CLOSER ANGLE.  Shooting through the glass panel we see
Sidney dialing.  His manner is urgent.

                                      QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

A long shot of the club exterior.  A different musical
number is now being played in the interior. (GOODBYE BABY).
A black car comes swiftly under the bridge, turns into the
little square opposite the club, braking sharply.

CLOSER ANGLE

As the car comes to a stop, CAMERA shoots across the hood
onto the windshield where we see the insignia: POLICE.
The occupants of the car are not visible.

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB

Sidney lingers near the doorway of the club.  He is looking
across the square towards the car which can be seen in b.g.
Now he turns and walks towards the coat rack, CAMERA tracking
with him.  He takes his own coat and, as he thrusts his arm
into the sleeve, contrives neatly to slip some unseen object
into the pocket of Steve's overcoat; CAMERA notes the
gesture, but only very briefly.  Overscene a voice addresses
Sidney:

                         D'ANGELO (O.S.)
            Hey!..........

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP.  As he turns in swift apprehension, we note the
moment of panic in his face.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA shoots past Sidney in foreground towards D'Angelo who
advances on Sidney.  D'Angelo's manner is unfriendly; for an
instant we feel, like Sidney, that D'Angelo may have seen
Sidney tampering with Steve's coat, but then we are reassured
as D'Angelo, deliberately using Sidney's surname, says:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            Mr. Falco...I hate to give you this
            satisfaction - they broke it off
            tonight for good.

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting across D'Angelo onto Sidney, who now relaxes, his
fears ungrounded.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            Tell that to Hunsecker - tell him
            we agree - he's a big man - he wins
            all the marbles!

SIDNEY

As D'Angelo moves away again Sidney looks after him.  Once
more his face goes tense. (He asks himself, does this
development - which he himself anticipated - change the
situation?) He turns away, moving out of shot.

ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA moves with Sidney as he walks towards the doorway.
There he hesitates again; he looks back into the club.

DALLAS

From Sidney's viewpoint.  A LONG SHOT of Steve on the
bandstand.  CAMERA PANS deliberately towards the coatrack in
f.g.  A group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot,
setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up
their coats. (Clearly, Sidney could not now return to the
coat rack - even if he decided that he did want to undo his
handiwork.)

RESUME SIDNEY

CAMERA, shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f.g.
Facing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the
sidewalk.  On the other side of the square the headlamps of
the car blink twice.  Sidney walks towards it.

POLICE CAR

A big man gets out of the seat next to the driver.  As he
comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing
truck illuminate him, identifying HARRY KELLO.  CAMERA PANS
as he walks to meet Sidney.

CLOSER ANGLE

Kello pauses as Sidney comes up to him, asks affably:

                         KELLO
            What's all the rush?  You said
            three o'clock.

                         SIDNEY
                   (glancing back
                   towards club)
            He's leaving early.  After this
            "set".  He'll be out in a couple of
            minutes...

They wait for a moment, listening to the sound of the music
in the distance.  It is a blues number (GOODBYE BABY) Kello
hums nonchalantly; Sidney glances at him with irritation,
finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner.

INT. POLICE CAR

There are two plainclothes policemen inside, one at the
wheel, the other in the back seat.  The latter leans forward
to ask the former:

                         1ST POLICEMAN
            What's this deal tonight?

                         MURPH
                   (the 2nd policeman)
            One of the lieutenant's "surprise
            parties", I think.

Murph's tone shows obvious repugnance.  The 1st Policeman
broods for a moment; he adds in a quiet, but viciously
resentful manner:

                         1ST POLICEMAN
            One of these days I'd like to turn
            in my badge and tangle with "POPSIE"
            myself - he's no good.

RESUME KELLO AND SIDNEY

Sidney, increasingly uncomfortable, turns to Kello.

                         SIDNEY
            Can't you wait up the block?  It's
            not going to look so good, right in
            front of the club...

To Kello this is a great joke.  He laughs, enjoying Sidney's
uneasiness.  He begins to "cat and mouse" Sidney.

                         KELLO
                   (heavily humorous)
            It's nice, Sidney, that you give me
            this tip...

                         SIDNEY
                   (interjecting)
            - He's got them on him.

                         KELLO
                   (solemnly nodding his approval)
            ...And he's got them on him.  I
            appreciate a thing like that - I
            appreciate where you are looking
            out for the virtue of the city.

Sidney, annoyed at this sarcasm, moves past Kello, not
deigning to respond.  As he goes by, Kello grasps him
forcibly by the arm.

                         KELLO
            What's your hurry, Snooks?

CAMERA HAS PANNED to SHOOT towards the car out of which
emerges a second detective.

                         SIDNEY
                   (revolted)
            Take your hands off, Kello...

Kello, holding Sidney, turns towards the second detective in
background.

                         KELLO
            Murph, how do you like this face?
            Why, I'll be darned -- it's melting!
            Something got you scared, Sidney...?
            Listen, rectify me a certain thing.
            Wasn't you kidding, Snooks, when
            you told J.J. I was fat...?

Sidney jerks his arm away, rapidly retreats a few yards, a
safe distance from Kello.  CAMERA PANS with him to the
bottom of the steps.

                         SIDNEY
            Sleep in peace, Kello -- you're
            skinny -- but J.J. says you sweat!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney in foreground, Kello and Murph beyond.  Kello laughs;
but obviously he would like to be nearer to Sidney.  Perhaps
to detain Sidney, Kello drawls:

                         KELLO
            Is that a fact?  He's a dilly,
            ain't he?  By the by, what did he
            have against this boy?

                         SIDNEY
            He goes out with girls.

                         KELLO
            Well, I'll be darned.  And what
            does J.J. think he SHOULD do?

                         SIDNEY
                   (impudently)
            Go out with DIFFERENT girls!

KELLO

He moves forward a little.

                         KELLO
                   (softly now)
            I get the peculiar impression,
            Snooks, that you don't like me.
            Could I be wrong?

SIDNEY

He turns swiftly and goes up the stairs out of Kello's reach.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he goes)
            You could be right, you fat slob?

ANOTHER ANGLE

From half-way up the stairs.  Sidney comes up the steps two
at a time.  Kello and Murphy are seen beyond.

                         KELLO
                   (with a guffaw)
            Come back here, Sidney...I wanna
            chastise you!...

FROM THE BRIDGE

Sidney reaches the top.  He comes along the pedestrian walk
up to CAMERA, slowing down he turns across the rail and
looks down towards the square.  CAMERA MOVES to take in the
scene in WIDE ANGLE: Sidney in foreground, the police car
and detectives below, the entrance to Robard's across the
square.  Sidney waits.  In the distance we can hear the
music of Dallas' last number coming to an end.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB

The last bars of the number.  Enthusiastic applause.

STEVE

He responds to the ovation, nicely but a little wearily.  He
gets down off the stand.  There is too much noise to hear
his parting words to his fellow musicians, but it is clear
that he is urging them to stay without him.  He walks off
towards the entrance to the club.

D'ANGELO

D'Angelo leaves the bar, in search of Steve.  He sees...

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Steve is putting his guitar away in the case, collecting his
overcoat.  In this gesture he is arrested by the sound of
D'Angelo's voice over scene.

                         D'ANGELO (O.S.)
                   (urgently)
            Steve!

Steve, mildly startled, looks up.

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting into the club.  D'Angelo comes forward from the bar.
He is a little drunk, a little emotional.  He waddles toward
Steve, then takes the white carnation out of his buttonhole
and puts it in the buttonhole of Steve's coat, saying:

                         D'ANGELO
                   (fondly)
            Press this in your friendship
            book...Love is a crooked thing,
            friendship not...
                   (then, sheepishly)
            You see, it comes out in the wash
            of a few drinks -- I'm a very
            sentimental guy.

RESUME ROBARD'S CLUB

Steve is touched.

                         STEVE
            I like it that way, Frank...don't
            change.

He picks up his guitar case and makes for the door.  D'Angelo
goes a few paces with him, CAMERA TRACKING.  Then it moves
past D'Angelo, following Steve out onto the sidewalk, where
he stands under the light of the club framed against the
dark background of the square.

FROM THE BRIDGE

CAMERA PANS from the small figure of Steve to include Sidney
big in foreground.  Below him Kello and Murph turn towards
the club.

KELLO

CLOSER ANGLE downward from Sidney's viewpoint.  Kello turns
deliberately to look at the bridge above.

RESUME BRIDGE

Sidney sees Kello's look; he nods deliberately.  Below him
we see Kello and Murphy move swiftly to get into the car.
Sidney, as if shrinking from a sight from which he doesn't
wish to witness, draws back from the balustrade.  He turns
and begins to walk towards CAMERA.

POLICE CAR

A LOW ANGLE SHOOTING upwards at the car, the stairs to the
bridge in background.  As the doors of the car slam, it
starts to move forward and, abruptly, its headlamps are
switched on, glaring into the lens.

EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Steve, concerned only with his only melancholy thoughts,
walks down the sidewalk under the bridge.  The car headlamps
illuminate him in their glare as they move across him.
Steve, without undue, interest, glances back but continues
on his way.

CAMERA SHOOTS eastward towards the silhouette of the bridge.
The Police Car turns as it comes out of the square under the
bridge towards CAMERA.  It moves slowly; again its headlamps
flare into the lens.  CAMERA PULLING BACK includes Steve in
foreground.  Behind him the Police Car slows down at the
curb; it barely stops as Kello slips out of the off-side
door; then the car moves forward along the curb leaving him
behind Steve.  As the car goes out of picture past CAMERA,
Kello strolls across the sidewalk, following Steve.  Steve,
looking past CAMERA, notices...

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA SHOOTS toward 2nd Avenue.  The Police Car slows down
again at the curb and Murph gets out of it, turning to face
Steve.

RESUME

Steve, seeing the man ahead of him, notes something slightly
menacing in his manner and slows down in his walk.  Then,
instinctively, he realizes that there is a second man behind
him, turns to look at Kello.  Kello approaches.

                         KELLO
            Hey, fella...!

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and CLOSER on Steve.  In his face we see
a growing sense of something wrong...

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB

A JUMP CUT.  Loud noise, Chico Hamilton on the drums...

INT. BAR

Another jump cut in the sound track.  Silence.  It is an
empty saloon, occupied only by a solitary drinker at one end
of the long bar, nursing a beer, and by the bartender who is
making out a dope sheet.  Sidney enters, strides to the bar
and throws down a jangling half dollar.

                         SIDNEY
            A bunch of nickels, mister!

While the change is made, Sidney stands with cocked head,
listening in reality or imagination to what is happening
down the street.  As the barman supplies the change, Sidney
goes to the juke box and loads it with nickels saying over
his shoulder:

                         SIDNEY
            A double Johnny Walker Black.  Or
            whatever you got.  Scotch.

Sidney puts both hands on the juke box as if leaning on it.
With a click, drop and whirl, the music box comes to life;
music blares out.  Pausing a moment, Sidney turns back
toward the bar.

SIDNEY

He reaches for his drink, downs it.  He is shivering.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Once more, an abrupt sound transition: the jam session at
full blast.  CAMERA FRAMES the musicians in foreground, but
moves away from them towards the entrance in background.
Near the doorway there is some activity; an attendant
beckons to Robard who is drinking with D'Angelo.  Robard
moves toward the entrance.

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA STARTS on D'Angelo at the bar.  He looks off after
Robard.  There is little concern in his face, but as he
watches, curiosity grows.  He strolls out after the
proprietor.  CAMERA TRACKS with him as D'Angelo comes to
join the little mob of two or three people on the sidewalk.
PANNING, THE CAMERA now SHOOTS TOWARDS 2nd Avenue.  Beyond
the bridge we can see the Police Car.  Kello and Murphy are
beside one of the open doors (into which Steve has been
carried). Murphy turns back, walks a few paces across the
sidewalk and picks up Steve's music case, which he carries
back to the Squad Car.  He gets in and the car drives off.

                         BOUNCER
            Hey, Robard, somebody just picked
            up one of your boys.

                         ROBARD
            What sa -- Wha --

REVERSE ANGLE

D'Angelo's face shows a bewildered astonishment and dismay
as he turns back to the couple of people who are talking to
Robard.  D'Angelo is a little befuddled with drink.  He
pushes towards Robard.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (dazed)
            Whatsa matter, Lou?

                         ROBARD
                   (turning to D'Angelo)
            I'm trying to find out myself.
            They just picked up Steve.

                         LOITERER
                   (blankly)
            Some fat guy...

                         2ND LOITERER
            A cop, a couple of cops.

                         LOITERER
            They smeared him all over the lot.

D'ANGELO

He turns to look back towards the direction in which the
Police Car has departed.  He seems unable to comprehend what
he has heard; but a slow and terrible fear is dawning on
him...

                                            LAP DISSOLVE TO:

Susan opens the door to discover Frank D'Angelo in lobby.
He speaks at once:

                         D'ANGELO
            I'm looking for your brother.  Is
            he home?

                         SUSAN
            No.
                   (sensing the
                   seriousness of his manner)
            Mr. D'Angelo - is something wrong?

D'Angelo has no wish to become involved with the girl; he
doesn't reply.

                         D'ANGELO
            When does he usually gets in, your
            night-owl brother?

                         SUSAN
            Seldom before five.
                   (again)
            What's the matter?  Would you care
            to come in a minute?

D'Angelo backs away, shaking his head.

                         D'ANGELO
            No...no.  Thanks.

He turns back to the elevator.  Susan closes the door, but
slowly; she is watching D'Angelo.  CAMERA MOVES WITH D'Angelo
as he goes to the bell of the elevator and rings it.  He
remains in this position, waiting for the elevator, but now
(believing himself to be alone) he leans his head against
the wall and begins to weep, quietly.  Surprisingly, Susan
is abruptly at his elbow, she seizes him forcibly by the
arm, demanding:

                         SUSAN
                   (taut)
            Something's happened.  To Steve.

D'Angelo, with his face contorted in grief and bitterness,
can no longer refuse to answer her.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (in a broken voice)
            He's in the hospital...He's under
            arrest, too... They planted reefer
            cigarettes on him...in his overcoat
            pocket.

Susan is becoming hysterical.

                         SUSAN
                   (wildly)
            Where is he...I want to go to him...

D'Angelo recovers his self control.  There is force and
authority in his voice as he insists:

                         D'ANGELO
            Miss Hunsecker, if you see him
            again they might...might kill him.

Susan is sobered by his seriousness.

                         SUSAN
                   (slowly)
            Who is "they"?

                         D'ANGELO
            Don't ask foolish questions.
                   (then)
            Tell your brother I'm a sensible
            man.  He understands only two
            things - power-politics and homage -
            tell him I came tonight to pay
            homage!

INT. HALLWAY - HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

The elevator door opens and Sidney steps out: He crosses to
the door of the apartment, pushes the button.  The bell is
heard ringing inside.  While he waits, Sidney produces a
handkerchief, dabs his face, straightens his tie; clearly he
is trying to sober up.  He goes to the bell push to ring
again.  Now he notices something that had escaped him
before: the door is not quite shut.  He pushes it open.

INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE

From inside.  Sidney hesitates, enters tentatively.

LONGER ANGLE

The apartment appears empty.  Only one light is lit; the
place is eerie.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney closes the door, goes into the main living room,
CAMERA pans with him.  Something chills him, he calls
softly, "J.J.?"

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney walks towards the study, there is nobody there either.
He goes back towards the stairs to the upper floor; in doing
so he repasses the door of Susan's bedroom, sees that it is
half open, goes to look in.

INT. BEDROOM

From Sidney's viewpoint.  The bed has been slept in but is
unoccupied.  The room is empty.

On the seat at the foot of the bed is a drawer that has been
pulled out of the wardrobe; it contains a collection of
miscellaneous objects, a snapshot album, letters, souvenirs,
disarranged as if someone had been looking at them.

SIDNEY

He looks at the empty room, disturbed.

RESUME BEDROOM

The curtains of the window onto the terrace are blowing: the
window is open.  Sidney walks into shot form behind CAMERA.
He calls:

                         SIDNEY
            Susan?

Susan steps into the room from the terrace, confronting
Sidney.  She is dressed, wearing the fur coat over a skirt
and blouse.  Her manner is very strange; the effect of the
drugs, no doubt.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney is very uncomfortable in her presence; Susan is the
last person he wants to have conversation with.

                         SIDNEY
            Where's J.J.?

He retreats across the threshold of the bedroom, into the
outer room.

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

She walks forwards.

                         SUSAN
            He isn't here...

INT. LIVING ROOM

Sidney stands back to let her pass.

                         SIDNEY
            But he called and said...

Susan comes out of the bedroom, walks past CAMERA.

                         SUSAN
            No, I called...

He studies the girl, says nothing.

LONGER ANGLE

She walks listlessly across the room, moving like a
somnambulist.

                         SUSAN
            Mr. D'Angelo phoned about Steve...I
            went down to the hospital, but they
            wouldn't let me in.  He promised to
            keep in touch with me - Mr.
            D'Angelo, I mean...

RESUME SIDNEY

He watches her cautiously, not sure of how to deal with her.

                         SIDNEY
                   (carefully)
            It's all over town about Dallas...
                   (moving towards her)
            How is he?

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  Susan's expression is blank; her eyes are
unseeing.

                         SUSAN
            He's...unconscious...

There is a tone of great despair in her voice.  Presently,
she recovers, CAMERA eases back to include Sidney beyond.
She glances at him.

                         SUSAN
            I...I gave Steve up...
                   (then)
            Why did you and J.J. do it?

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney looks at her, tensely.  Her voice is so calm, so
certain that Sidney finds it difficult to play-act innocence.
He protests a little too loudly:

                         SIDNEY
            Susie, if I get your meaning,
            you're pitching very wild balls.
            What -

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

Susan interrupts, with a simplicity which is damaging.

                         SUSAN
            Don't bother to lie, Sidney.
                   (moving away)
            I don't care anymore.

LONGER ANGLE

Sidney decides that it is wiser not to argue.  He assumes a
tolerant sympathy.  He moves towards her.

                         SIDNEY
            Listen, get a good night's sleep -
            tomorrow's another day.  Feeling
            sorry for yourself won't help.

                         SUSAN
                   (shaking her head)
            I'm sorry about Steve, not myself.
            I'm even sorry for my brother.  To
            be so lonely, without one real
            friend in the world - to have to
            hang on to a worthless rag of a
            girl like me because she's his only
            real family -

                         SIDNEY
                   (moving towards her again)
            Come on now, chickie, why don't you
            go to bed...?

Now she turns to him.

                         SUSAN
            And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney.
            You're going down with the ship.

                         SIDNEY
            What ship?

She walks past him, still aimlessly wandering about the
room; then she turns back, indicates herself.

                         SUSAN
            THIS ship.

She studies Sidney.

                         SUSAN
            Don't you know how my brother will
            see you after tonight?  You'll be
            the man who drove his little
            stainless sister to suicide...
REVERSE ANGLE

Shaken, Sidney decides to ridicule the implied threat.

                         SIDNEY
            Honey, I'll just have to smile at
            that.

He walks past CAMERA.

RESUME SUSAN

Sidney walks into shot, going past her on his way to the door.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he goes)
            It's late and I'm going home...

Susan, in foreground, remains quite still, says nothing.  In
background, Sidney slows down, his confidence failing him;
he looks back at her.

SIDNEY

He can't go.  Probably, she's bluffing.  But he can't be
certain.  He is suddenly angry.

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

He strides back towards her.

                         SIDNEY
            Susie, whatever problems you have
            with J.J. - I didn't invent them!
            What're you blaming me for?  If you
            learned to let out your hatred you
            would be better off!

                         SUSAN
            Like you?

                         SIDNEY
            Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on
            my own gall - I fight back!  Let
            THEM choke, not me!

                         SUSAN
            I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -

                         SIDNEY
            I know that bit - you're a girl;
            you need a man to give you strength!
            So what do you pick such weak
            sisters for?  Don't you know yet
            that you fight fire with fire, not
            with tear drops?

                         SUSAN
            I could almost forgive you if what
            you did to Steve came from jealousy
            and love...

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            I didn't do anything!

                         SUSAN
            ...but you did it for greed,
            Sidney - and that's pathetic.

She moves past him.  He grips her, turning her around.

                         SIDNEY
            Don't run away - I was always the
            man for you!  I'm talking to you
            out of two years of silence -
            listen to what I say!  Inside of
            six months -

                         SUSAN
                   (helplessly)
            Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -

CAMERA HOLDS Sidney and Susan in foreground.  But it is now
shooting towards the door of the apartment.  A PANNING
movement has included a figure at the other end of the big
room...

HUNSECKER

He is taking off his overcoat near the door of the apartment.
We don't know how long he has been there, how much he has
overheard.  Without appearing to be consciously spying,
Hunsecker is listening to Sidney's voice over scene.

                         SIDNEY
                   (over scene)
            Listen to me, lunatic!  All your
            life you've been doing penance for
            crimes you never committed!  I
            could change that, I'd teach you,
            I'd show you - !

CAMERA PANS round with Hunsecker who strolls across the
room, making his presence known.  Sidney breaks off, drops
his hands, releasing the girl.  Susan turns towards Hunsecker.
Hunsecker lays his briefcase and papers on the table.  He
addresses Susan without looking at her.

                         HUNSECKER
            Go to bed, Susie.  It's late...

Susan makes no move.  Hunsecker glances at her, sees Sidney
but treats Sidney as if he were invisible.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to Susan)
            What is he doing here?

Susan walks towards Hunsecker.

                         SUSAN
            I called him.

Sidney moves forward also.

                         SIDNEY
                   (carefully)
            She was depressed - she heard about
            Dallas.

Hunsecker still ignores his existence, he walks past Susan
carrying his papers to the desk.  Susan turns, watching him.

                         HUNSECKER
                   ("controlling" his feelings)
            That subject it might be better not
            to start me on.
                   (angry)
            He's made all the papers tonight.

Hunsecker studies the item in the paper.

SUSAN

She is staring at her brother.  Suddenly, she is unable to
suffer his authoritative air; she goes to him; he ignores
her...

HUNSECKER AND SUSAN

Childishly, she snatches the paper from his hand, throws it
to the floor.  He looks at her.  Patiently, as with a
hysterical infant, he stoops, recovers the paper.

                         HUNSECKER
                   ("mildly")
            Is there something you wanted to
            say...?
                   (as she does not
                   answer, continuing
                   with growing viciousness)
            I've put up with a lot of your
            guff, Susie, because you were a
            child.  But you're a woman now and
            I suspect, despite my best
            intentions, more than a bit of a
            slut...

SUSAN

Her head comes up sharply at the insult.

HUNSECKER AND SUSAN AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker glances at Sidney, clearly reminding them of the
compromising situation in which they were found.  Sidney
moves to answer.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quickly)
            J.J., if you think -

                         SUSAN
                   (cutting in)
            Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't
            matter now...

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            Whose arms will I have to pry you
            out of next?  Not that I don't
            think you didn't invite it!  I know
            that look of yours, that pose of
            being wronged - and how it arouses
            the crusading instinct in even a
            Sidney Falco -

Hunsecker's rising tide of brutality is having some effect
on Susan, and Sidney, fearing for her, tries to intervene.

                         SIDNEY
            I was trying to build her up, not
            tear her down -

                         HUNSECKER
                   (viciously)
            Is that why you were romancing her,
            you mutt!
                   (turning back to Susan)
            Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd
            like it fine if you found another
            home.  That means the front door is
            open!  Pack your things, rent a
            moving van and GIT!
                   (pacing the room)
            And as for marriage, let me hit you
            with a few choice facts: you aren't
            ready for marriage!  You're
            incompetent - a capricious and
            shaky frail with a sick fatality
            for frail and useless men!

Susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near Hunsecker's
feet.  After a moment she turns and moves to the door of her
bedroom; her walk is a little unsteady; she goes inside,
closes the door in Hunsecker's face.

INT. BEDROOM

With the door closed, she leans against it as if afraid of
falling.  She gropes for the door handle, finds the key and
turns it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker is studying the closed door.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to himself)
            Another crisis past.
                   (walking away)
            She'll be fast asleep in five
            minutes, loaded with those headache
            pills...

SIDNEY

Sidney seems not to hear this remark.  He is concentrated on
the door; he moves hesitantly towards it, apprehensive.
CAMERA includes Hunsecker in background.

                         HUNSECKER
            Now we'll get to you, Sidney.
                   (turning to Sidney)
            As far as the column is concerned -
            tonight you have forfeited every
            ethical consideration I ever felt
            for you...

Much more concerned with his anxiety for Susan, Sidney
interrupts.

                         SIDNEY
                   (cutting in)
            Look, J.J., I'll grant you anything
            you want.
                   (as Hunsecker is
                   about to interrupt)
            Susie's off her rocker tonight!  Go
            in and see what she's doing!  Go in
            and talk to her quietly - unless
            you want a corpse!

Sidney's conviction is impressive.  But Hunsecker is
unwilling to admit the danger, he continues.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (acid)
            Let me finish what I started to
            say -

Seeing that Hunsecker is not taking his advice, Sidney
strides swiftly to the door of Susan's bedroom.  He knocks
on it.

INT. BEDROOM

SHOOTING TOWARDS the door.  Susan is sitting on the bed in
foreground.  In a methodical, hypnotic way, she is destroying
the contents of the drawer, tearing letters into small
fragments.  Sidney's voice is heard outside: "Susie!" Susan
appears not to hear it; CAMERA TRACKS closer to her.
Sidney's voice is heard again, louder: "Susie!" Susan turns
sharply towards the door.

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  Susan rises to her feet, staring at the door.
She begins to back away from it.

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA PULLS BACK as Susan glances down at the record player
beside her.  She turns the knob.  We hear the clatter of a
record dropping and music begins.  The tune is "The Sage."

INT. LIVING ROOM

CLOSE SHOT of Sidney.  He hears the music starting.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker has come forward.  But now, as he listens to the
gramaphone record playing in the bedroom, Hunsecker relaxes,
assuming that this is a sign that Sidney's suspicions are
unfounded.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (coming forward)
            What a cornball you are, Sidney...

CAMERA TRACKS to include Sidney.  He does not share
Hunsecker's confidence; he knocks again, calling:

                         SIDNEY
                   (anxiously)
            Susie!
                   (in growing fear)
            SUSIE!

CAMERA TRACKS closer to Sidney.  As he tries the doorknob,
CAMERA TILTS DOWN.  Sidney's hand tries the doorknob, finds
it locked, shakes it forcefully.

DETAIL

From inside the bedroom.  We see the doorknob rattled.

RESUME SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  She realizes that Sidney means to insist.  She
turns away towards the blowing curtains in background.

RESUME LIVING ROOM

A DETAIL SHOT.  Sidney's hand is still shaking the doorknob.
He releases it.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to a TWO SHOT of Sidney
and Hunsecker as Sidney retreats from the door in
apprehension.  Now Hunsecker has begun to share Sidney's
anxiety.  He moves to the door, knocks and then pounds on it.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with authority)
            Susie, this is J.J.!  Open up!

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  She comes forward past the blowing curtains.
The wind whips at her hair.  Over scene we hear the rumble
of the traffic on Broadway far below.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He is pounding on the door again.  CAMERA makes a quick pan
to Sidney who, in a split second, realizes that Susan may
have gone out on the balcony.  He turns, dashes towards the
study to look out on the terrace.

RESUME SUSAN

She has now started to climb onto the parapet.  Sidney leaps
into shot, dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of
shot.  We hear Susan cry out, a hysterical gasp.  CAMERA,
looking through the windows of Susan's bedroom, sees the
door fly open as Hunsecker bursts into the room.  He looks
swiftly around, advances towards the open window.
Exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone, he switches it
off; he steps out onto the terrace.  CAMERA PANS with him as
he turns to look back into the study where Susan's inanimate
figure is sprawled on the floor, half across the low
upholstered footstool.  Sidney, white and shaking, is
standing over her.

REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA at floor level.  Susan is framed in foreground.  The
lower half of Sidney can be seen beside her.  Hunsecker is
on the terrace in background.  Shocked, he moves quickly
into the room.

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE UP.  He looks down at his sister.  He is badly
shaken.  The sharp bite of terror produces a reaction of
something akin to anger.  But he swiftly controls it.  He
moves past CAMERA.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker stoops into shot.  Tenderly, he lifts the girl's
body to get it into the arm chair.  Susan is quite lifeless,
limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any
instinct for self-preservation.  But as she feels her
brother's arms, and as she recognizes who it is, she breaks
out in hysteria.

                         SUSAN
                   (wildly)
            No!  NO!  Don't touch me!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (sharply)
            Susan!...

But Susan strikes at him, a vicious gesture of revulsion.
Hunsecker lets her go.  She falls into the arm chair, her
face hidden from him; she begins to sob.

                         SUSAN
                   (her body shaking)
            Go away!...Go away!...

Hunsecker would like to comfort her, but he dare not touch
her again for fear of inviting another rebuff.  He is deeply
hurt and wounded.  Embarrassed that Sidney should watch this
moment, Hunsecker rises.  To cover his emotion, he walks to
the tray of drinks in background; he pours a brandy and
comes back.  Stooping, he offers it to Susan.  Her only
reaction is again to wrench herself away from him, facing
the opposite direction.

                         SUSAN
                   (sobbing bitterly)
            GO AWAY!

Hunsecker sets down the drink, stands up.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (in a choked voice)
            Talk to her, Sidney...

                         SIDNEY
                   (hushed)
            Talk to her yourself...

Over scene the telephone rings.  It is ignored.  While
Hunsecker looks down at the girl, helplessly, the telephone
continues to ring.

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  It is she who first becomes aware of the
telephone.  Her weeping has stopped now.  Slowly, she raises
her head.  CAMERA EASES BACK to include Sidney beyond her;
he notes this movement, seeing in it a revival of the girl's
will to live; he is moved.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The telephone is framed in foreground, Susan beyond.  It
continues to ring.  As Hunsecker crosses to his desk to pick
up the instrument, CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Hunsecker speaks:

                         HUNSECKER
            Yuh...Yuh...
                   (he listens)
            Just a minute...
                   (turning back to Susan)
            Susie, it's Mr. D'Angelo - from the
            hospital...

RESUME SUSAN

A CLOSE SHOT.  She raises her head higher, still weakly.  We
see in her face a mixture of terror and hope.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker comes forward to set down the telephone in front
of her, on the footstool.  Hunsecker and Sidney watch.  She
reaches a hand, which is still trembling, picks up the
receiver.  Her voice as she speaks to the instrument is
barely audible.

                         SUSAN
            Yes...yes...yes...

Presently, she hangs up.  When she becomes aware that
Hunsecker and Sidney are waiting for an explanation, she
tells them:

                         SUSAN
                   (speaking with difficulty)
            Steve...is out of danger...

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker nods.  He already knows this.  Then:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (soberly)
            That means a lot to you?

SUSAN

She does not look at him, she lowers her eyes but answers
with a nod.  And then, more positively:

                         SUSAN
            Yes.

RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies the girl.  His face has hardened.  He moves,
beginning to pace. (And also beginning his 'manipulations'.)

                         HUNSECKER
            But I have to warn you, Susie - for
            your own sake - he'll still do
            time...

CAMERA FOLLOWS Hunsecker.  It now takes in Sidney who is
standing beside him.  Sidney has begun to stare fixedly at
Hunsecker. (He is now realizing that Hunsecker, although he
has been faced with this demonstration of the girl's
willingness to kill herself, has still learned nothing, is
still continuing in the old pattern.)

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing, warming
                   to his theme)
            He's a hop-head - that's a felony
            in New York.  I can try, of course,
            to...

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP.  Revolted, Sidney breaks in:

                         SIDNEY
            You're unholy, J.J.!  You'd rather
            kill this girl than let her go!

GROUP SHOT

Hunsecker wheels on Sidney, bellowing:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (in blind rage)
            GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

Sidney, with equal heat, spins round to Susan, crying out
before he has time to check himself:

                         SIDNEY
                   (impulsively)
            Susie, YOU get out of this house! -
            Get out before it's too late!

SIDNEY

Sidney has gone too far now to pull back.  Inevitably, he
continues.  During the speech, CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Susan and then Hunsecker.

                         SIDNEY
                   (with sincerity)
            Listen with care - this will cost
            me everything, so you know I'm
            telling you the truth!

                         HUNSECKER
                   (trying to stop him)
            You're incapable of the truth...

                         SIDNEY
                   (who will not by stopped)
            Susie, there's nothing wrong with
            Dallas!
                   (turning toward Hunsecker)
            Your brother and I arranged it all.
            And if the Leslie boy is still a
            squooshy item in your life, forget
            it! - your brother arranged that
            one, too!  I don't usually give
            away presents; but this is my gift
            to you: Get out of here!  Leave
            this man!

During the latter part of the speech, Susan rises slowly to
her feet, staring first at Sidney and then, with fearful
significance, at her brother.  Hunsecker does not look at
her; he is concentrated on Sidney.  Twice he has been about
to demolish Sidney, but he now stops, A THOUGHT IN HIS HEAD.

HUNSECKER

He is perfectly controlled, smiling.

                         HUNSECKER
            Like most Italians, Sidney's got a
            big gift for dramatics.  I, however,
            prefer the cool and stubborn facts.
            Sidney has not appeared in my
            column in weeks - check that fact
            with Mary.  That leads right to
            another fact: Sidney had nothing to
            lose tonight!  To the contrary,
            dear - ONLY HIS OBVIOUS GREED TO
            BEAT HIS WAY BACK INTO THE COLUMN
            EXPLAINS HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME!
            In brief, BLACKMAIL!

Hunsecker pauses impressively.

GROUP SHOT

Framing Hunsecker in foreground, Susan and Sidney beyond.
Susan listens to Hunsecker objectively, with a mounting
sense of his diseased reasoning.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            Mind you, not that one true fact
            didn't come out of Sidney's mouth
            tonight: self-admittedly, he
            committed a vicious crime of
            jealousy against Steve Dallas!
                   (pausing)
            Now we have to clear Dallas, don't
            we?...But I'll have to sacrifice
            him...
                   (he indicates Sidney)
            ...to do it.
                   (turning to Susan)
            Am I doing right?

SUSAN

She is looking at Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (over scene)
            Yes or no, Susie...?

Slowly, Susan nods.

REVERSE ANGLE

SHOOTING ACROSS Susan onto Hunsecker.  Hunsecker turns away
from her and walks to the telephone.  He picks it up and
begins to speak.  While the scene continues, we hear his
voice off screen, speaking to the phone, saying: "This is
J.J. Hunsecker.  I want you to get a message through to
Lieutenant Kello.  Ask him to ring me back.  It's urgent."
Susan backs slowly away from Hunsecker.  Then she turns into
CAMERA, which TRACKS with her and includes Sidney.  Susan
looks at Sidney and then, ashamed, avoids his eye.  But
Sidney comes nearer to her.  Susan is deeply distressed.

                         SUSAN
                   (very quietly)
            He's sick.

She looks again at Sidney.  Deliberately, Sidney nods.
Susan walks toward her bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM

Susan comes into the room, finding shelter from the
revelation which has so appalled her.  Inexorably Sidney
follows her.  He comes across the threshold, closes the door.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quietly)
            Yes, he's sick and you're the only
            idiot alive who didn't know it.

A pause.  Sidney moves closer to her.

                         SIDNEY
            But what are you going to do?

There are some tears of pity in Susan's eyes.  Once more she
moves away from Sidney.  Sidney senses that her compassion
for Hunsecker might easily lead her once again to slip back
into the trap.  He insists:

                         SIDNEY
                   (with emphasis)
            You don't owe your brother a cup of
            water!

Another pause.  Sidney again repeats:

                         SIDNEY
            What are you going to do?

She moves away from Sidney, CAMERA following her.  After a
moment, she answers:

                         SUSAN
            Go to Steve.

SIDNEY

Sidney is moved, having done his solitary act of chivalry.
To hide his feelings, he is harsh:

                         SIDNEY
                   (sharply)
            For Pete's sake, straighten out the
            seams of your stockings - comb your
            hair - don't be so helpless all the
            time!

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Susan.  From the other room, we
hear the telephone ring.  Sidney turns and goes quickly out.
After a moment, Susan looks back at the door through which
Sidney has disappeared.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Hunsecker is framed in foreground, speaking into the
telephone.  Sidney is in background, outside the door of
Susan's bedroom.  Hunsecker is fully aware of Sidney's
presence, as he says:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (to phone)
            No, he's admitted that, Harry.  My
            kid sister's a witness.

SIDNEY

A CLOSE SHOT.  He watches Hunsecker with a curious detachment.
Producing a cigarette, he lights it and then looks up
towards Hunsecker.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (over scene)
            No, he admits he planted the stuff
            on the Dallas boy...

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker framed in foreground, Sidney beyond.  Hunsecker
has at the same time been tapping a cigarette on the desk.
Sidney walks across to Hunsecker, offers the lighted match.

HUNSECKER - REVERSE ANGLE

As he accepts the light he continues speaking to the phone:

                         HUNSECKER
            Yeah...jealousy.

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Sidney turns on his heel, walking out of the apartment.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...He's been trying to make my
            sister behind my back.

CAFE ON BROADWAY

Kello is in a phone booth.

                         KELLO
                   (to phone)
            Oh, that's serious, J.J.  Real
            reprehensible...

Kello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through
the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls
ahead to a position ready for him outside the door.

                         KELLO
                   (to phone)
            Don't worry, I'll get there.  I'm
            on Broadway now.

Kello hangs up.  Hurries out.  We see him get into the squad
car which rapidly accelerates.

INT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM

Hunsecker has hung up.  He stares at the telephone for a
moment.  Then he moves towards Susan's door, CAMERA TRACKING
with him.  He comes to the threshold, looks at Susan who is
standing in much the same position in which Sidney left her.

SUSAN

Unaware that her brother is watching her, she picks up the
fur coat on the bed. (She is about to start packing her
belongings.) She turns as she hears Hunsecker speak.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (over scene)
            That's a pretty coat.

REVERSE ANGLE

SHOOTING ACROSS Susan, towards Hunsecker.  Hunsecker comes
into the room.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            - but it's about time you had a new
            one.

Susan turns squarely to face him.

RESUME SUSAN

She braces herself to tell him:

                         SUSAN
                   (soberly)
            I'm leaving, J.J.

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

He does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone
(or, if he does, refuses to recognize it.)

                         HUNSECKER
                   (with a faint scoff)
            Don't kid a kidder.  I'll see you
            for breakfast around eleven.

Without waiting for a response, Hunsecker goes out, closing
the door.  Susan stares at it for a moment.  Then she moves
to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed.

TERRACE

Hunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace, comes out and
looks over the parapet, (looking to see how far Sidney has
got, hoping to see Kello's squad car.)

RESUME SUSAN

She completes her simple packing, closing the suitcase.
With a gesture that is obviously automatic, she starts to
put on the fur coat; then she halts, realizing what she is
doing.  She pauses; CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  Now, deliberately
she throws the coat back on the bed.  CAMERA PANS down with
the gesture.  She looks down at the coat, the discarded
symbol of her dependence upon her brother.  CAMERA PULLS
BACK again as she takes a quick look round, then goes to
take a duffle coat from the wardrobe.  She throws this over
her arm, picks up the suitcase, goes to the door.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Susan comes out of the door.  She moves with a sober
determination, expecting to find Hunsecker in the room.
CAMERA TRACKS with her.  But then she realizes that Hunsecker
has gone out on the terrace.  She takes a step or two
towards him, then pauses.

HUNSECKER

From Susan's viewpoint, SHOOTING through the big glass
windows.  Hunsecker is at the parapet.  He is impatiently
looking down into Broadway.

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  She now realizes that there is no point in
saying goodbye to him: she has already told him that she is
leaving and, if she becomes involved in further argument
with him, it can do no good.  Yet there is some emotion on
her face as she takes a last look at her brother; she turns
away.

HUNSECKER

Framing him in foreground at the parapet.  Susan can be seen
through the windows before she disappears to the door.
Hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on Broadway
below...

EXT. BROADWAY

The squad car comes down Broadway at speed.

EXT. DUFFY'S SQUARE

Sidney is walking across the square.  The squad car appears
in foreground; it pauses hardly at all as Kello slips out of
it, and starts to move after Sidney.  Then the car
accelerates round Duffy Square to cut Sidney off on the
other side.

SIDNEY

Sidney comes up towards CAMERA.  Seeing something ahead, he
halts...

SQUAD CAR

From Sidney's viewpoint.  The car breaks to a stop.  It's
door opens and a detective gets out slowly.  It is Phil.

RESUME SIDNEY

Sidney is framed in foreground, the squad car beyond.
Sidney knows what this means.  He starts to speak before he
turns to look over his shoulder.

                         SIDNEY
            Hello, Harry...

REVERSE ANGLE

Kello, moving silently up behind Sidney, slows down, amused
at Sidney's prescience.

                         KELLO
            Hi!
                   (coming to join Sidney)
            I just been on the phone to J.J.

Kello's manner is almost affectionate.  He shakes his head,
admonishing Sidney.

                         KELLO
                   (mildly)
            You been a bad boy, Sidney.  J.J.'s
            going to write about you in his
            column tomorrow.

REVERSE ANGLE

SHOOTING ACROSS Kello onto Sidney.  Sidney's smile is tired.

                         SIDNEY
            I thought he would.

                         KELLO
            Yeah...
                   (then)
            And another thing - he's gonna say
            you 'resisted arrest'...
                   (as Sidney nods)
            You know J.J....!

Sidney turns away to look back towards Phil.  Then, taking
Kello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop
viciously across the mouth.

KELLO

Kello's head jerks back.  Recovering at once, he guffaws,
lurches into CAMERA with a sudden vicious movement.  There
is a sharp guttural cry over scene.

LONGER ANGLE

Phil runs forward towards the figures of Sidney and Kello
seen beyond him.  In doing so, he blocks the view so that we
do not clearly see the violence with which Kello strikes
Sidney down.  Phil, in foreground, is seen to relax.  When
he moves aside, clearing the view, Sidney is writhing on the
ground at Kello's feet.

CLOSER ANGLE

Kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief.  He signals to
Phil to help lift the body at his feet.  Phil enters shot
and they raise Sidney, half carrying, half dragging him out
of shot.

LONG SHOT

The cops carry the figure of Sidney Falco across Duffy
Square; they bundle him into the police car.  The pigeons in
the square, circle.

HUNSECKER'S TERRACE

CAMERA LOOKS down towards Duffy Square in the distance.  The
police car can be seen moving off, circling the square and
disappearing southward on Broadway.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Hunsecker in foreground.

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE SHOT, SHOOTING sharply upward at Hunsecker.  He
looks down, quiet impassively, and there is a slightly
insane grandeur, a paranoiac superiority in the way that he
turns back, dismissing Sidney from his thoughts.

INT. LIVING ROOM

CAMERA SHOOTS towards the closed door of Susan's room.
Hunsecker walks into the shot, stops before the door.  He
begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt, clearly
preparing to go to bed.  As an after-thought, he comes back
to the door, addresses it:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (gently)
            Susie?
                   (getting no answer)
            Are you in bed...?

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  It is at a low level, still emphasizing
the man's dignity.  He strolls for a few paces.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            I don't have to tell you, of
            course, that I cleared your
            boyfriend's name; I didn't let you
            down...

CAMERA has now moved so that we are shooting past Hunsecker
onto Susan's door.  He gets no answer except silence.

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE SHOT, REVERSE ANGLE.  We now see in his face a
flicker of fear.  With what is clearly an effort, he
reassumes a confident manner.

                         HUNSECKER
            ...I was saving this news for
            breakfast, but I think I'll jump
            the gun!  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AND
            DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS
            TOWN HAS EVER SEEN!

Still no answer from inside the bedroom.  Hunsecker's forced
expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face.  He
calls out:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie...?

INT. BEDROOM

The room is quite empty.  CAMERA SHOOTS across the bed
towards the door in background.  Susan's discarded fur coat
lies on the bed.  And the doors of the wardrobe are open.
Hunsecker's voice can be heard continuing over scene:

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (outside)
            I'm getting the Mayor to perform
            the ceremony and - NO, I think I'll
            fly the Governor down from Albany...
                   (a pause)
            Do you hear...?

A pause.  Then, very tentatively, the bedroom door is opened.

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
                   (outside)
            Are you listening?...

Now he opens the door and comes in.

HUNSECKER

A BIG CLOSE UP.  The sight of the empty room freezes his
face for a moment.  His eyes look round.

INT. BEDROOM

From Hunsecker's viewpoint.  A PANNING SHOT, from the open
door of the cupboard to the fur coat.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Hunsecker.  He steps to the bed, picks up the coat.

REVERSE ANGLE

There is a dazed, incredulous look on his face.  But, as he
glances over his shoulder, CAMERA ZOOMS PAST him towards a
little door in the wall behind him: It is ajar, showing a
couple of inches of light.

RESUME HUNSECKER

Once again Hunsecker reassures himself that Susan must be
behind the door.  But his voice is even more false as he
declares:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (a note of anger
                   appearing in his voice)
            Susie!...You won't threaten
            me!...Nobody walks out on J.J.
            Hunsecker!
CAMERA NOW MOVES CLOSER and closer to Hunsecker.  The ANGLE
is a weird one, tilting grotesquely upward.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            You need me - you all need me!...

Hunsecker, his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat,
walks towards the door.  CAMERA PANS with him.  He stands a
few inches from the narrow opening.  He seems about to push
the door open further, but is afraid to do so.

INT. BATHROOM

CAMERA SHOOTS ACROSS the bathtub, showing enough of the tiny
room to make it clear that it, too, is completely empty.
Through the slit in the door, we can see only a glimpse of
the movement of Hunsecker outside.  Hunsecker's voice
continues:

                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)
            "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall
            not want".
                   (a sneering laugh)
            That's bunk in a book!  I'm the
            Shepherd of millions of little men
            and women!...

INT. BEDROOM

A DOWNWARD ANGLE, SHOOTING past Hunsecker to the door.  As
Hunsecker retreats from the door, he is still clutching the
fur coat.  He stands alone in the middle of the room and his
gestures are a little wild.  CAMERA rises higher to shoot
down at Hunsecker, alone in the little room.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            ...I don't ask them to get on their
            knees, but they come to me for
            advice and guidance!  Who are you
            to reject me!

With an increasingly eccentric manner, Hunsecker strides out
of the bedroom door into the living room again.

INT. LIVING ROOM

A similar ANGLE, SHOOTING down on Hunsecker as he comes out
of the bedroom.  But as he starts to roam the vast room,
CAMERA rises higher still, pulling backwards and upwards to
a LONG SHOT which holds the entirety of the big room in all
its ugliness.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            What makes YOU fit to sit in
            judgment on a man like me.  Only a
            great person understands another
            great person, and that leaves you
            out!

Hunsecker is now addressing the whole of the apartment, no
longer pretending even to himself, that the girl is still
listening.  He moves off towards the windows to the terrace
where the curtains are now blowing in the morning wind.  He
goes out towards the terrace, his voice becoming more
distant - a man shouting empty nonsense, addressing no one.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            - That leaves you ALL out!  You're
            pigmies!  You're all sick, weak
            midgets!  I'm proud to be alone!...

EXT. BROADWAY

CAMERA SHOOTS STEEPLY UP towards the top of the Brill Bldg.
(At this angle Hunsecker's terrace will not be visible but
its position is established in relationship to the Budweiser
sign.) CAMERA PANS DOWN to pick up the figure of Susan
Hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto
Broadway.

CLOSER ANGLE

Susan pauses on the sidewalk.  She stays there for a moment.
She breathes in the fresh morning air, looking around with
the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes.
Then she starts up Broadway - away from the Times Square
area.  The girl's step has a purpose in it; she has
confidence and courage.  Music for the end titles is quiet,
simple and lyrical.
